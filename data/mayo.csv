Find out what  and how much  to eat. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Eating a healthy diet during pregnancy is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your baby. After all, the food you eat is your baby's main source of nutrition. Consider these pregnancy nutrition tips to promote your baby's growth and development.     Grains       Grains provide essential carbohydrates, your body's main source of energy. Many whole-grain and enriched products also contain fiber, iron, B vitamins and various minerals. Fortified bread and cereal can help you get enough folic acid.   What to eat:  Make sure at least half of your grains each day are whole grains. You can get most of your day's grains with a bowl of fortified cereal for breakfast, a lunchtime sandwich made with two slices of whole-wheat bread and whole-wheat pasta for dinner.   To optimize pregnancy nutrition, trade sugary cereals and white bread for whole-grain cereals, brown rice, whole-wheat pasta and whole-grain bread. Try wild rice or barley in soups, stews, casseroles and salads. Look for products that list whole grains, such as whole-wheat flour, first in the ingredients list.     Fruits and vegetables       Fruits and vegetables are critical components of pregnancy nutrition, since they provide various vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber to aid digestion. Vitamin C, found in many fruits and vegetables, helps you absorb iron. Dark green vegetables have vitamin A, iron and folate  other important nutrients during pregnancy.   What to eat or drink:  Top your cereal with slices of fresh fruit. Make a veggie pizza. Add extra vegetables to your casserole.   If you're tired of apples, oranges and green beans, branch out. Try apricots, mangoes, pineapple, sweet potatoes, winter squash or spinach. Make trail mix with a variety of dried fruit. Fruit juice counts, too, but remember that too much juice can lead to undesired weight gain.     Meat, poultry, fish, eggs and beans       Foods in this group have plenty of protein, as well as B vitamins and iron. Protein is crucial for your baby's growth.   What to eat:  Try whole-wheat toast with peanut butter for breakfast. Eat a scrambled egg or an omelet for lunch. Serve a salmon fillet for dinner. Add chickpeas or black beans to your salad. Snack on soy nuts.   If your traditional sources of protein no longer appeal to you, experiment with other options. Fish is an excellent source of protein as well as omega-3 fatty acids, which can promote your baby's brain development. Avoid fish that's potentially high in mercury, however, including swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish and shark.     Dairy products       The calcium in dairy products and calcium-fortified soy milk helps build your baby's bones and teeth. Dairy products also have vitamin D and protein. Aim for 3 cups a day.   What to eat or drink:  Eat yogurt for your afternoon snack. Drink the milk in your cereal bowl. Have a glass of skim milk with dinner. Add low-fat cheese to a salad.   If you have trouble digesting dairy products, get creative. Try calcium-fortified orange juice or sardines. Experiment with lactose-reduced or lactose-free products. Use an over-the-counter lactase enzyme product when you eat or drink dairy products.       Next   Share Tweet   Feb. 15, 2017   References     Staying healthy and safe.

Find out what foods to avoid during pregnancy. By Mayo Clinic Staff       You want what's best for your baby. That's why you add sliced fruit to your fortified breakfast cereal, top your salads with chickpeas and snack on almonds. But do you know what foods to avoid during pregnancy? Here's help understanding pregnancy nutrition basics.     Avoid seafood high in mercury       Seafood can be a great source of protein, and the omega-3 fatty acids in many fish can promote your baby's brain and eye development. However, some fish and shellfish contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury. Too much mercury could harm your baby's developing nervous system.   The bigger and older the fish is, the more mercury it's likely to contain. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages pregnant women to avoid:     Swordfish   Shark   King mackerel   Tilefish     So what's safe? Some types of seafood contain little mercury. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 8 to 12 ounces  two or three servings  of seafood a week for pregnant women. Consider:     Shrimp   Salmon   Pollock   Catfish   Anchovies   Trout   Cod   Tilapia   Light canned tuna     However, limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces (170 grams) a week.     Avoid raw, undercooked or contaminated seafood       To avoid harmful bacteria or viruses in seafood:     Avoid raw fish and shellfish.  Examples include sushi, sashimi, and raw oysters, scallops or clams.   Avoid refrigerated, uncooked seafood.  Examples include seafood labeled nova style, lox, kippered, smoked or jerky. It's OK to eat smoked seafood if it's an ingredient in a casserole or other cooked dish. Canned and shelf-stable versions also are safe.   Understand local fish advisories.  If you eat fish from local waters, pay attention to local fish advisories  especially if water pollution is a concern. If you are uncertain about the safety of fish you have already eaten, don't eat any other fish that week.   Cook seafood properly.  Cook fish to an internal temperature of 145 F (63 C). Fish is done when it separates into flakes and appears opaque throughout. Cook shrimp, lobster and scallops until they're milky white. Cook clams, mussels and oysters until their shells open. Discard any that don't open.       Avoid undercooked meat, poultry and eggs       During pregnancy, you're at increased risk of bacterial food poisoning. Your reaction might be more severe than if you weren't pregnant. Rarely, food poisoning affects the baby, too.   To prevent foodborne illness:     Fully cook all meats and poultry before eating.  Use a meat thermometer to make sure.   Cook hot dogs and luncheon meats until they're steaming hot  or avoid them completely.  They can be sources of a rare but potentially serious foodborne illness known as listeriosis.   Avoid refrigerated pates and meat spreads.  Canned and shelf-stable versions, however, are OK.   Cook eggs until the egg yolks and whites are firm.  Raw eggs can be contaminated with harmful bacteria. Avoid foods made with raw or partially cooked eggs, such as eggnog, raw batter, and freshly made or homemade hollandaise sauce and Caesar salad dressing.       Avoid unpasteurized foods       Many low-fat dairy products  such as skim milk, mozzarella cheese and cottage cheese  can be a healthy part of your diet. Anything containing unpasteurized milk, however, is a no-no. These products could lead to foodborne illness. Avoid soft cheeses, such as Brie, feta and blue cheese, unless they are clearly labeled as being pasteurized or made with pasteurized milk. Also, avoid drinking unpasteurized juice.

Understand which nutrients you need most and where to find them. By Mayo Clinic Staff       There's no magic formula for a healthy pregnancy diet. In fact, during pregnancy the basic principles of healthy eating remain the same  get plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats. However, a few nutrients in a pregnancy diet deserve special attention. Here's what tops the list.     Folate and folic acid  Prevent birth defects       Folate is a B vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects, serious abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord. The synthetic form of folate found in supplements and fortified foods is known as folic acid. Folic acid supplementation has been shown to decrease the risk of premature birth.   How much you need:  400 to 800 micrograms a day of folate or folic acid before conception and throughout pregnancy   Good sources:  Fortified cereals are great sources of folic acid. Leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, and dried beans and peas are good sources of naturally occurring folate.         Food   Serving size   Folate or folic acid content           Source: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 28           Cereal   3/4 cup (15 to 60 g) ready-to-eat cereal   100 to 700 mcg  choose a cereal that's 50 to 100 percent fortified       Spinach   1/2 cup (95 g) boiled spinach   131 mcg       Beans   1/2 cup (89 g) boiled Great Northern beans   90 mcg       Asparagus   4 boiled spears (60 g)   89 mcg       Oranges   1 small orange (96 g)   29 mcg       Peanuts   1 ounce (28 g) dry roasted   27 mcg         In addition to making healthy food choices, taking a daily prenatal vitamin  ideally starting three months before conception  can help ensure you're getting enough of this essential nutrient. All women who might become pregnant should take a daily vitamin supplement containing folic acid.     Calcium  Strengthen bones       You and your baby need calcium for strong bones and teeth. Calcium also helps your circulatory, muscular and nervous systems run normally.   How much you need:  1,000 milligrams a day; pregnant teenagers need 1,300 milligrams a day   Good sources:  Dairy products are the best absorbed sources of calcium. Nondairy sources include broccoli and kale. Many fruit juices and breakfast cereals are fortified with calcium, too.

Which brand is best? Or what to do if they make you queasy? Get answers to these questions and more. By Mayo Clinic Staff       A healthy diet is the best way to get the vitamins and minerals you need  but even if you eat a healthy diet, you might fall short on key nutrients. If you're pregnant or hoping to conceive, prenatal vitamins can help fill any gaps.     How are prenatal vitamins different from other vitamins?       Prenatal vitamins typically contain more folic acid and iron than do standard adult multivitamins. Here's why:     Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects.  These defects are serious abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord.   Iron supports the baby's growth and development.  Iron also helps prevent anemia, a condition in which blood has a low number of healthy red blood cells.     In addition, some research suggests that prenatal vitamins decrease the risk of having a baby who is small for his or her gestational age.     Do I need to be concerned about other nutrients?       Not all prenatal vitamins include omega-3 fatty acids, which might help promote a baby's brain development. If you don't eat fish or other foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, your health care provider might recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplements in addition to prenatal vitamins.   Calcium and vitamin D are important as well  especially during the third trimester, when your baby's bones are rapidly growing and strengthening.     Which brand of prenatal vitamins is best?       Prenatal vitamins are available over-the-counter in nearly any pharmacy. Your health care provider might recommend a specific brand of prenatal vitamins or leave the choice up to you. Generally, look for a prenatal vitamin that contains:     Folic acid   Calcium   Iron   Vitamin D     It also might be beneficial to look for a prenatal vitamin that contains vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, iodine and copper.   Remember, prenatal vitamins are a complement to a healthy diet  not a substitute for good nutrition. Prenatal vitamins won't necessarily meet 100 percent of your vitamin and mineral needs.   In addition, your health care provider might suggest higher doses of certain nutrients depending on the circumstances. For example, if you've given birth to a baby who has a neural tube defect, your health care provider might recommend a separate supplement containing a higher dose of folic acid  such as 4 milligrams (4,000 micrograms)  before and during any subsequent pregnancies.

Answers from  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.         You may be tempted to take prenatal vitamins because of unproven claims that they promote thicker hair and stronger nails. However, if you're not pregnant and not planning to become pregnant, high levels of certain nutrients over a long period of time may actually be more harmful than helpful.   Prenatal vitamins are formulated specifically for women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, and women who are breast-feeding, with particular emphasis on:     Folic acid.  To reduce the risk of having a child with neural tube defects, women who are trying to become pregnant should get 600 micrograms (mcg) of folate or folic acid a day through diet and supplements. Other healthy adults  both men and women  need only 400 mcg a day. While uncommon, getting too much folic acid by taking supplements can mask the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency and delay diagnosis and treatment.   Iron.  During pregnancy, the recommended intake of iron is 27 milligrams (mg) a day. Women between the ages of 19 and 50 who aren't pregnant need only 18 mg a day, and women age 51 and older and all adult men need only 8 mg a day. Getting too much iron can be toxic because it can build up in your body, causing constipation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and, in severe cases, possibly death.   Calcium.  Pregnant adult women and healthy men and women ages 19 to 50 all need 1,000 mg a day. Men and women age 51 and older need 1,000 mg a day and 1,200 mg a day, respectively. Because prenatal vitamins are intended to supplement calcium you get in your diet, they generally contain only 200 to 300 mg of calcium. If you rely on prenatal vitamins to meet your calcium needs, you likely won't get enough, raising your risk of osteoporosis and other health problems.     Generally, if you eat a healthy, well-balanced diet, taking multivitamins of any sort isn't necessary.         With      Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.

How much should you eat? What should you avoid? How might your diet affect your baby? Follow these important nutrition tips. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you're breast-feeding, you're giving your baby nutrients that will promote his or her growth and health. You might have questions, however, about what foods and drinks are best for you  and how your diet might affect your breast milk and your baby.   Understand the basics of breast-feeding nutrition.     Do I need extra calories while breast-feeding?       Yes, you might need to eat a little more  about an additional 400 to 500 calories a day  to keep up your energy.   To get these extra calories, opt for nutrient-rich choices, such as a slice of whole-grain bread with a tablespoon (about 16 grams) of peanut butter, a medium banana or apple, and 8 ounces (about 227 grams) of yogurt.     What foods should I eat while breast-feeding?       Focus on making healthy choices to help fuel your milk production. Opt for protein-rich foods, such as lean meat, eggs, dairy, beans, lentils and seafood low in mercury. Choose a variety of whole grains as well as fruits and vegetables. Wash your fruits and vegetables to reduce exposure to pesticide residue.   Eating a variety of different foods while breast-feeding will change the flavor of your breast milk. This will expose your baby to different tastes, which might help him or her more easily accept solid foods down the road.    To make sure you and your baby are getting all of the vitamins you need, your health care provider might recommend continuing to take a daily prenatal vitamin until you wean your baby.     How much fluid do I need while breast-feeding?       Drink frequently, preferably before you feel thirsty, and drink more if your urine appears dark yellow. Have a glass of water nearby when you breast-feed your baby.   Be wary of juices and sugary drinks, however. Too much sugar can contribute to weight gain  or sabotage your efforts to lose pregnancy weight. Too much caffeine can be troublesome, too. Limit yourself to no more than 2 to 3 cups (16 to 24 ounces) of caffeinated drinks a day. Caffeine in your breast milk might agitate your baby or interfere with your baby's sleep.

Concentrate on eating a healthy diet and including physical activity in your daily routine. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you're like most new moms, you're eager to put away your maternity clothes and slip into your old jeans. Understand the smart way to approach weight loss after pregnancy and promote a lifetime of good health.     Consider your eating habits       When you were pregnant, you might have adjusted your eating habits to support your baby's growth and development. After pregnancy, proper nutrition is still important  especially if you're breast-feeding. Making wise choices can promote healthy weight loss after pregnancy.     Focus on fruits, vegetables, monounsaturated fats, and whole grains.  Foods high in fiber  such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains  provide you with many important nutrients while helping you feel full longer.   Eat smaller portions.  Eating smaller portions is linked with weight loss and weight maintenance over time. Don't skip meals or limit the amount of fruits and vegetables in your diet, though  you'll miss vital nutrients.   Avoid temptation.  Surround yourself with healthy foods. If junk food poses too much temptation, keep it out of the house.   Don't try quick fixes.  There's no magic bullet for losing weight.       Include physical activity in your daily routine       In the past, women were often told to wait at least six weeks after giving birth to begin exercising. Today, however, the waiting game is over.   If you exercised during pregnancy and had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, it's generally safe to begin light exercise within days of delivery  or as soon as you feel ready. If you had a C-section or a complicated birth, talk to your health care provider about when to start an exercise program. Generally, you might be able to start light exercises about 4 to 6 weeks after your delivery.   When your health care provider gives you the OK:     Get comfortable.  If you're breast-feeding, feed your baby right before you exercise to avoid discomfort caused by engorged breasts. Wear a supportive bra and comfortable clothing.   Start slowly.  Begin with simple exercises that strengthen major muscle groups, including your abdominal and back muscles. Gradually add exercises of moderate intensity, such as brisk walking or bike riding on a level surface.   Include your baby.  If you have trouble finding time to exercise, include your baby in your routine. Take your baby for a daily walk in a stroller or baby carrier. Lay your baby next to you while you stretch on the floor, or include your baby in strength training activities  such as lifting the baby above you while you lie on your back.   Don't go it alone.  Invite other moms to join you for a daily walk, or try a postpartum exercise class. Working out with others might help motivate you.     Remember to drink plenty of water before, during and after each workout. Stop exercising if you experience pain. This might be a sign that you're overdoing it.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   July 15, 2014         The most recent advice from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Most women and young children should eat more fish. However, at the same time, they warn about fish dangers. Confused? Read on.   As early as 1994, the FDA alerted the public about mercury contamination of fish. Ten years ago it cautioning those most vulnerable to mercury contamination  women who might become pregnant, women who are pregnant, nursing mothers, their infants and young children. The advice was to avoid these fish due to high mercury content:     Tilefish   Shark   Swordfish   King mackerel     Additional advice includes:     Limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces a week.   Limit other types of fish to no more than 12 ounces a week (adjust the serving size to be appropriate for young children).   When you or others catch your own fish (and you are unaware if there is an advisory on fish caught from the body of water)  limit to 6 ounces a week (adults) or 1 to 3 ounces a week (young children).     Now 10 years later, the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency are again altering their recommendations  but balancing the concern about mercury intake with equal concern about not getting the beneficial nutrients and health effects fish can provide when eaten. Fish contain high quality protein, many vitamins and minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and some contain vitamin D. The nutritional value of fish is especially important during growth and nerve and brain development before birth, in early infancy for breastfed infants, and in childhood.   The new guidelines set a minimum amount of fish to eat. They also provide suggestions for healthier fish choices. Women who might become pregnant, women who are pregnant, nursing mothers and young children should:     Eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week (adjust the serving size to be appropriate for young children).   Choose fish lower in mercury. These include salmon, pollock, tilapia, cod and tuna (including light canned).     The FDA continues to advise avoidance of the four fish listed above because of high mercury content. The FDA also continues to recommend limiting white (albacore) tuna to no more than 6 ounces weekly. The advisory about catching your own fish remains in effect too.   These are subtle, but important changes. Many pre-pregnant, pregnant and nursing women currently consume only about 1.8 ounces of fish a week  when they should be eating 8 to 12 ounces a week. The new advisory helps balance the scales in favor of eating safe amounts of safe fish.       With      Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.

If you're unsure about whether it's safe to eat seafood during your pregnancy, you're not alone. Understand the guidelines for pregnancy and fish. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Pregnancy nutrition can be confusing, especially when it comes to seafood guidelines. Here's help understanding the facts.     What are the pros and cons of eating seafood during pregnancy?       Seafood, which includes fish and shellfish, can be a great source of protein, iron and zinc  crucial nutrients for your baby's growth and development. The omega-3 fatty acids in many fish, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), also can promote your baby's brain development.   But some types of seafood  particularly large, predatory fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish  can contain high levels of mercury. Although the mercury in seafood isn't a concern for most adults, special precautions apply if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant. If you regularly eat fish high in mercury, the substance can accumulate in your bloodstream over time. Too much mercury in your bloodstream could damage your baby's developing brain and nervous system.     How much seafood is recommended?       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that pregnant women eat at least 8 ounces and up to 12 ounces (340 grams) of a variety of seafood lower in mercury a week. That's about two to three servings.        Next   Share Tweet   June 17, 2016   References     USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 28.

Supplements aren't for everyone, but older adults and others may benefit from specific supplements. By Mayo Clinic Staff       The Dietary Guidelines for Americans make it clear that your nutritional needs should be met primarily through your diet.   For some people, however, supplements may be a useful way to get nutrients they might otherwise be lacking. But before you go shopping for supplements, get the facts on what they will and won't do for you.     Supplements vs. whole foods       Supplements aren't intended to be a food substitute because they can't replicate all of the nutrients and benefits of whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables. So depending on your situation and your eating habits, dietary supplements may not be worth the expense.   Whole foods offer three main benefits over dietary supplements:     Greater nutrition.  Whole foods are complex, containing a variety of the micronutrients your body needs  not just one. An orange, for example, provides vitamin C plus some beta carotene, calcium and other nutrients. It's likely these compounds work together to produce their beneficial effect.   Essential fiber.  Whole foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, provide dietary fiber. Most high-fiber foods are also packed with other essential nutrients. Fiber, as part of a healthy diet, can help prevent certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and it can also help manage constipation.   Protective substances.  Whole foods contain other substances important for good health. Fruits and vegetables, for example, contain naturally occurring substances called phytochemicals, which may help protect you against cancer, heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. Many are also good sources of antioxidants  substances that slow down oxidation, a natural process that leads to cell and tissue damage.       Who needs supplements?       If you're generally healthy and eat a wide variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, low-fat dairy products, lean meats and fish, you likely don't need supplements.   However, the dietary guidelines recommend supplements  or fortified foods  in the following situations:     Women who may become pregnant should get 400 micrograms a day of folic acid from fortified foods or supplements, in addition to eating foods that naturally contain folate.   Women who are pregnant should take a prenatal vitamin that includes iron or a separate iron supplement.   Adults age 50 or older should eat foods fortified with vitamin B-12, such as fortified cereals, or take a multivitamin that contains B-12 or a separate B-12 supplement.   Adults age 65 and older who do not live in assisted living or nursing homes should take 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily to reduce the risk of falls.     Dietary supplements also may be appropriate if you:     Don't eat well or consume less than 1,600 calories a day.   Are a vegan or a vegetarian who eats a limited variety of foods.   Don't obtain two to three servings of fish a week. If you have difficulty achieving this amount, some experts recommend adding a fish oil supplement to your daily regimen.   Are a woman who experiences heavy bleeding during your menstrual period.   Have a medical condition that affects how your body absorbs or uses nutrients, such as chronic diarrhea, food allergies, food intolerance, or a disease of the liver, gallbladder, intestines or pancreas.   Have had surgery on your digestive tract and are not able to digest and absorb nutrients properly.     Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about which supplements and what doses might be appropriate for you. Be sure to ask about possible side effects and interactions with any medications you take.       Next   Share Tweet   Oct. 18, 2014   References     Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010.

May 5, 2016         For women who are planning and hoping to become pregnant, success may involve more than just timing.   Certain lifestyle factors prior to conception and early in pregnancy may improve the odds of a healthy pregnancy. And it may not be only a woman's lifestyle choices that play a role.   A recent study followed 344 couples who became pregnant. The couples enrolled in the study prior to conception and recorded their lifestyle behaviors throughout the pregnancy. Both men and women were given diaries to record daily lifestyle habits, such as caffeinated and alcoholic beverage intake. Women also noted whether they took over-the-counter or prenatal vitamins.   Of these couples, 28 percent experienced a miscarriage. While the study was not designed to prove cause and effect, miscarriage appeared to be associated with a woman's age. Women age 35 or older had nearly twice the miscarriage risk of younger women.   In addition, there were interesting findings related to multivitamins and caffeine:     Women who routinely took multivitamin-mineral supplements before conception and during early pregnancy had a much lower risk of miscarriage.   Among women, drinking more than two caffeinated beverages a day during the weeks before conception and the first several weeks of pregnancy appeared to be associated with a higher risk of miscarriage.   Men's preconception caffeine consumption also appeared to impact pregnancy. Drinking more than two caffeinated beverages a day during the weeks before conception appeared to be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss.     It's not always clear why miscarriage happens. Because miscarriage is common, it's difficult to determine whether there is a relationship between caffeine and miscarriage.    Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking did not appear to be associated with miscarriage in this study, but other studies do link alcohol and smoking to pregnancy loss. Women trying to become pregnant should still follow current recommendations not to smoke or drink alcohol. Their partners also should not smoke or drink excessive amounts of alcohol, which can cause infertility.   If you're planning to become pregnant, why not view it as an opportunity to make a few positive lifestyle changes?   You and your partner can support each other in adopting healthy habits. And you'll have a head start on being good role models for your kids.

Know the risk factors, symptoms and what you can do to avoid it. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you're pregnant, you're at an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia, a condition in which you don't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Find out why anemia during pregnancy occurs and what you can do about it.     What causes iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy?       Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen to your tissues. During pregnancy, you need double the amount of iron that nonpregnant women need. Your body needs this iron to make more blood to supply oxygen to your baby.  If you don't have enough iron stores or get enough iron during pregnancy, you could develop iron deficiency anemia.     How does iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy affect the baby?       Severe anemia during pregnancy increases your risk of premature birth, having a low birth weight baby and postpartum depression. Some studies also show an increased risk of infant death immediately before or after birth.     What are the risk factors for iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy?       You are at increased risk of developing anemia during pregnancy if you:     Have two closely spaced pregnancies   Are pregnant with more than one baby   Are vomiting frequently due to morning sickness   Don't consume enough iron   Have a heavy pre-pregnancy menstrual flow   Have a history of anemia before your pregnancy         Next   Share Tweet   Feb. 15, 2017   References     Frequently asked questions.

From promoting your baby's development to paving the way for post-pregnancy weight loss, here's why pregnancy weight gain matters. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Like it or not, eating for two isn't a license to eat twice as much as usual. Use healthy lifestyle habits to manage your pregnancy weight gain, support your baby's health and make it easier to shed the extra pounds after delivery.     Pregnancy weight-gain guidelines       There's no one-size-fits-all approach to pregnancy weight gain. Appropriate weight gain for you depends on various factors, including your pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (BMI). Your health and your baby's health also play a role. Work with your health care provider to determine what's right for you.   Consider these general guidelines for pregnancy weight gain:         Pre-pregnancy weight   Recommended weight gain           Underweight (BMI < 18.5)   28 to 40 lbs. (about 13 to 18 kg)       Normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9)   25 to 35 lbs. (about 11 to 16 kg)       Overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9)   15 to 25 lbs. (about 7 to 11 kg)       Obese (BMI 30 or more)   11 to 20 lbs. (about 5 to 9 kg)           When you're carrying twins or other multiples       If you're carrying twins or other multiples, you'll likely need to gain more weight. Again, work with your health care provider to determine what's right for you.   Consider these general guidelines for pregnancy weight gain if you're carrying twins:         Pre-pregnancy weight   Recommended weight gain           Normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9)   37 to 54 lbs. (about 17 to 25 kg)       Overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9)   31 to 50 lbs. (about 14 to 23 kg)       Obese (BMI 30 or more)   25 to 42 lbs. (about 11 to 19 kg)           When you're overweight       Being overweight before pregnancy increases the risk of various pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes, high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, and the need for a C-section. Although a certain amount of pregnancy weight gain is recommended for women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy, some research suggests that women who are obese can safely gain less weight than the guidelines recommend. Further study is needed.   Work with your health care provider to determine what's best in your case and to manage your weight throughout pregnancy.     When you're underweight       If you're underweight before pregnancy, it's essential to gain a reasonable amount of weight while you're pregnant. Without the extra weight, your baby might be born early (premature birth) or smaller than expected.       Next   Share Tweet   Feb. 15, 2017   References     Macones G.

Will my baby be able to get enough nutrients?  	Answers from Shannon K. Laughlin-Tommaso, M.D.       Pregnancy after gastric bypass can be safe and healthy if managed well by you and your health care provider. In fact, research suggests that pregnancy after weight-loss surgery might be safer for both mother and baby than pregnancy complicated by obesity.   Although more research is needed, studies suggest that weight-loss surgery might protect obese women and their babies from obesity-related problems during pregnancy. Examples include gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia  high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the kidneys, after 20 weeks of pregnancy.   If you have had weight-loss surgery and are considering pregnancy, consult your health care provider for preconception planning. You might also consult a registered dietitian along with your gastric bypass surgeon for advice on nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy.   Experts typically recommend postponing pregnancy until your weight stabilizes  typically at least 12 to 18 months after surgery. Some experts recommend waiting longer. Rapid or persistent weight loss might deprive a growing baby of important nutrients, leading to low birth weight. To monitor your baby's growth, your health care provider might recommend a fetal ultrasound during the third trimester.   Depending on the type of weight-loss surgery and your specific nutritional needs, your health care provider also might recommend certain nutritional supplements  such as folic acid, vitamin B-12, vitamin D, iron and calcium  in addition to a daily prenatal vitamin before and during pregnancy.

Drinking more than two caffeinated beverages a day during the weeks before conception appeared to be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss.     It's not always clear why miscarriage happens. Because miscarriage is common, it's difficult to determine whether there is a relationship between caffeine and miscarriage.    Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking did not appear to be associated with miscarriage in this study, but other studies do link alcohol and smoking to pregnancy loss. Women trying to become pregnant should still follow current recommendations not to smoke or drink alcohol. Their partners also should not smoke or drink excessive amounts of alcohol, which can cause infertility.   If you're planning to become pregnant, why not view it as an opportunity to make a few positive lifestyle changes?   You and your partner can support each other in adopting healthy habits. And you'll have a head start on being good role models for your kids.

Understand the risks of obesity during pregnancy  plus steps to promote a healthy pregnancy. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Being obese during pregnancy can have a major impact on your health and your baby's health. Find out about the possible complications, recommendations for weight gain and what you can do to promote a healthy pregnancy.     What's considered obese?       Obesity is defined as having an excessive amount of body fat. A formula based on height and weight  called the body mass index (BMI)  is often used to determine if a person is obese.         BMI   Weight status           Below 18.5   Underweight       18.5-24.9   Normal       25-29.9   Overweight       30 and higher   Obese       40 and higher   Extreme obesity           Could obesity affect my ability to get pregnant?       Being obese can harm your fertility by inhibiting normal ovulation. Obesity can also affect the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF). As a woman's BMI increases, so does the risk of unsuccessful IVF.     How might obesity affect my pregnancy?       Being obese during pregnancy increases the risk of various pregnancy complications, including:     Gestational diabetes.  Women who are obese are more likely to have diabetes that develops during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) than are women who have a normal weight.   Preeclampsia.  Women who are obese are at increased risk of developing a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the kidneys (preeclampsia).   Infection.  Women who are obese during pregnancy are at increased risk of urinary tract infections. Obesity also increases the risk of postpartum infection, whether the baby is delivered vaginally or by C-section.   Overdue pregnancy.  Obesity increases the risk that pregnancy will continue beyond the expected due date.   Labor problems.  Labor induction is more common in women who are obese. Obesity can also interfere with the use of certain types of pain medication, such as an epidural block.   C-section.  Obesity during pregnancy increases the likelihood of elective and emergency C-sections. Obesity also increases the risk of C-section complications, such as wound infections. Women who are obese are also less likely to have a successful vaginal delivery after a C-section (VBAC).   Pregnancy loss.  Obesity increases the risk of miscarriage.

But there will be time spent at home, as well. Here are some tips for caring for your child at home.       Strive for good nutrition.  Your baby may have a difficult time taking in enough calories, both because he or she tires more easily during feeding and because of an increased demand for calories. It's often helpful to give your baby frequent, small feedings.   Breast milk is an excellent source of nutrition, but formula works well, too. You may find that a combination of both provides a good balance of nutrition and scheduling flexibility. Ask your doctor or hospital about available resources for pumping breast milk. Some hospitals rent breast pumps. Your child's cardiologist may also recommend nutritional supplements or visiting a dietitian for the details.       Preventive antibiotics.  Your child's cardiologist will likely recommend that your child take preventive antibiotics before certain dental and other procedures to prevent bacteria from entering the bloodstream and infecting the inner lining of the heart (infective endocarditis).   Practicing good oral hygiene  brushing and flossing teeth, getting regular dental checkups  is another good way of preventing infection.     Help your child stay active.  Encourage as much normal play and activity as your child is able to tolerate, or as your doctor recommends, with ample opportunity for rest and nap time. Staying active helps your child's heart stay fit.   As your child grows, talk with the cardiologist about which activities are best for your child. If some are off-limits, such as competitive sports, encourage your child in other pursuits rather than focusing on what he or she can't do.   Keep up with routine well-child care.  Standard immunizations are encouraged for children with congenital heart defects, as well as vaccines against the flu, pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus infections.   Keep regular follow-up appointments with your child's doctor.  Your child may need regular annual appointments with his or her doctor trained in congenital heart conditions to evaluate his or her condition. Your child's doctor may recommend several tests to evaluate your child's heart condition.     Adults with tricuspid atresia   If you're an adult with tricuspid atresia, keep regular follow-up appointments with your doctor trained in congenital heart conditions. Your doctor may recommend several tests to evaluate your condition at follow-up appointments.   Your doctor may recommend that you take preventive antibiotics before certain dental or medical procedures to prevent infective endocarditis.   Ask your doctor about what activities are best for you, and if there are any sports or activities that you may need to limit or avoid.   If you're a woman with tricuspid atresia and you're considering becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor regarding the risks of pregnancy. If you're pregnant and you have tricuspid atresia or another congenital heart condition, your doctor will likely recommend that you receive care from a doctor trained in treating women with congenital heart defects who are pregnant.

Find out how calories determine your weight and ways you can best cut calories from your diet.   By Mayo Clinic Staff       Despite all the diet strategies out there, weight management still comes down to the calories you take in versus those you burn off.   Fad diets may promise you that avoiding carbs or eating a mountain of grapefruit is the secret to weight loss, but it really comes down to eating fewer calories if you want to shed pounds.     Calories: Fuel for your body       Calories are the energy in food. Your body has a constant demand for energy and uses the calories from food to keep functioning. Energy from calories fuels your every action, from fidgeting to marathon running.    Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are the types of nutrients that contain calories and are the main energy sources for your body. Regardless of where they come from, the calories you eat are either converted to physical energy or stored within your body as fat.   These stored calories will remain in your body as fat unless you use them up, either by reducing calorie intake so that your body must draw on reserves for energy, or by increasing physical activity so that you burn more calories.     Tipping the scale       Your weight is a balancing act, but the equation is simple: If you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight.   Because 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound.    So, in general, if you cut 500 calories from your typical diet each day, you'd lose about 1 pound a week (500 calories x 7 days = 3,500 calories).   It isn't quite this simple, however, and you usually lose a combination of fat, lean tissue and water. Also, because of changes that occur in the body as a result of weight loss, you may need to decrease calories further to continue weight loss.     Cutting calories       Cutting calories doesn't have to be difficult. In fact, it can be as simple as:     Skipping high-calorie, low-nutrition items   Swapping high-calorie foods for lower calorie options   Reducing portion sizes         Next   Share Tweet   April 11, 2015   References     Atallah R, et al.

Know what to expect during your twin pregnancy, from nutrition and weight gain to possible complications. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you're diagnosed with a twin pregnancy or other multiples, here's what you need to know to take good care of yourself  and your babies.     How multiples are made       Sometimes a twin pregnancy just happens. In other cases, specific factors are at play. For example, a twin pregnancy is more likely as you get older because hormonal changes can cause more than one egg to be released at a time. Use of assisted reproductive technologies  such as in vitro fertilization  also boosts the odds of twins or other multiples.   Fraternal twins  the most common kind  occur when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm. Each twin has his or her own placenta and amniotic sac. The twins can be two girls, two boys, or a boy and a girl. Genetically, they're no more alike than any other siblings.   Identical twins occur when a single fertilized egg splits and develops into two fetuses. Identical twins might share a placenta, but each baby usually has a separate amniotic sac. Genetically, the two babies are identical. They'll be the same sex and share physical traits and characteristics. Rarely, identical twins fail to completely separate into two individuals. These babies are known as conjoined twins.   Triplets and other higher order multiples can be identical, fraternal or a combination of both.     Diagnosing a twin pregnancy       Your health care provider might suspect a twin pregnancy if your uterus is larger than normal or there seems to be more than one fetal heartbeat. A suspected twin pregnancy is typically confirmed with an ultrasound. During this exam, sound waves are used to create images of your uterus and baby  or babies.   Sometimes a seemingly normal twin pregnancy is later found to have only one baby. This is known as vanishing twin syndrome. Such an episode can be heartbreaking, frustrating and confusing. Often, there's no clear explanation for the loss.       Next   Share Tweet   Dec. 13, 2014   References     Mandy GT.

How can I make sure I get enough calcium during my pregnancy?    Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         For many women, the ability to digest lactose improves during pregnancy, especially later in pregnancy. As a result, even if you're normally lactose intolerant, you might be able to drink milk and eat other dairy products without discomfort.   Calcium helps build your baby's bones and teeth. The Institute of Medicine recommends 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day during pregnancy. Pregnant teens need 1,300 milligrams a day. It can be hard to meet this requirement if you don't include milk or other dairy products in your diet.   However, if you experience lactose intolerance during pregnancy or dislike milk or other dairy products, consider these tips:     Choose other calcium-rich foods, such as sardines, salmon with bones, tofu, broccoli, spinach, and calcium-fortified juices and foods.   Take calcium supplements.   Many people who are lactose intolerant can usually drink small portions of milk, such as a half cup, with a meal and have minimal or no symptoms.   Try lactose-free or lactose-reduced products, including milk, cheese and yogurt.   Yogurt and fermented products, such as cheeses, are often better tolerated than is regular milk.

Will you need special prenatal care? Will your baby be OK? Get the facts about high-risk pregnancies. By Mayo Clinic Staff       A high-risk pregnancy might pose challenges before, during or after delivery. If you have a high-risk pregnancy, you and your baby might need special monitoring or care throughout your pregnancy. Understand what causes a high-risk pregnancy, and what you can do to take care of yourself and your baby.     What are the risk factors for a high-risk pregnancy?       Sometimes a high-risk pregnancy is the result of a medical condition present before pregnancy. In other cases, a medical condition that develops during pregnancy for either mom or baby causes a pregnancy to become high risk.   Specific factors that might contribute to a high-risk pregnancy include:     Advanced maternal age.  Pregnancy risks are higher for mothers age 35 and older.   Lifestyle choices.  Smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol and using illegal drugs can put a pregnancy at risk.   Medical history.  A prior C-section, low birth weight baby or preterm birth  birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy  might increase the risk in subsequent pregnancies. Other risk factors include a family history of genetic conditions, a history of pregnancy loss or the death of a baby shortly after birth.   Underlying conditions.  Chronic conditions  such as diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy  increase pregnancy risks. A blood condition, such as anemia, an infection or an underlying mental health condition also can increase pregnancy risks.   Pregnancy complications.  Various complications that develop during pregnancy pose risks, such as problems with the uterus, cervix or placenta. Other concerns might include too much amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) or low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), restricted fetal growth, or Rh (rhesus) sensitization  a potentially serious condition that can occur when your blood group is Rh negative and your baby's blood group is Rh positive.   Multiple pregnancy.  Pregnancy risks are higher for women carrying twins or higher order multiples.       What steps can I take to promote a healthy pregnancy?       Whether you know ahead of time that you'll have a high-risk  pregnancy or you simply want to do whatever you can to prevent a high-risk  pregnancy, stick to the basics. For example:     Schedule a preconception appointment.  If you're thinking about becoming pregnant, consult your health care provider. He or she might counsel you to start taking a daily prenatal vitamin and reach a healthy weight before you become pregnant. If you have a medical condition, your treatment might need to be adjusted to prepare for pregnancy. Your health care provider might also discuss your risk of having a baby with a genetic condition.   Be cautious when using assisted reproductive technology (ART).  If you're planning to use ART to get pregnant, consider how many embryos will be implanted. Multiple pregnancies carry a higher risk of preterm labor.   Seek regular prenatal care.  Prenatal visits can help your health care provider monitor your health and your baby's health. Depending on the circumstances, you might be referred to a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine, genetics, pediatrics or other areas.   Eat a  healthy diet.  During pregnancy, you'll need more folic acid, calcium, iron  and other essential nutrients. A daily  prenatal vitamin can help fill any gaps. Consult your health care provider if  you have special nutrition needs due to a health condition, such as diabetes.   Gain  weight wisely.  Gaining the right amount of weight can support your baby's  health  and make it easier to shed the extra pounds after delivery. Work with  your health care provider to determine what's right for you.   Avoid  risky substances.  If you smoke, quit.  Alcohol and illegal drugs are off-limits, too. Get your health care provider's  OK before you start  or stop  taking any medications or supplements.       Do I need special tests?       If you have a high-risk pregnancy, you might consider various tests or procedures in addition to routine prenatal screening tests. Depending on the circumstances, your health care provider might recommend:     Specialized or targeted ultrasound.  This type of fetal ultrasound  an imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of a baby in the uterus  targets a suspected problem, such as abnormal development.   Amniocentesis.  During this procedure, a sample of the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy (amniotic fluid) is withdrawn from the uterus. Typically done after week 15 of pregnancy, amniocentesis can identify certain genetic conditions, as well as neural tube defects  serious abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord.   Chorionic villus sampling (CVS).  During this procedure, a sample of cells is removed from the placenta. Typically done between weeks 10 and 12 of pregnancy, CVS can identify certain genetic conditions.   Cordocentesis.  This test, also known as percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, is a highly specialized prenatal test in which a fetal blood sample is removed from the umbilical cord. Typically done after week 18 of pregnancy, the test can identify chromosomal conditions, blood disorders and infections.   Cervical length measurement.  Your health care provider might use an ultrasound to measure the length of your cervix at prenatal appointments to determine if you're at risk of preterm labor.   Lab tests.  Your health care provider might take a swab of your vaginal secretions to check for fetal fibronectin  a substance that acts like a glue between the fetal sac and the lining of the uterus. The presence of fetal fibronectin might be a sign of preterm labor.   Biophysical profile.  This prenatal test is used to check on a baby's well-being. The test combines fetal heart rate monitoring (nonstress test) and fetal ultrasound.     Some prenatal diagnostic tests  such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling  carry a small risk of pregnancy loss. Ultimately, the decision to pursue prenatal testing is up to you and your partner. Discuss the risks and benefits with your health care provider.

Understand how to support your daughter as she deals with teenage pregnancy.     Provide support       Teenage pregnancy is often a crisis for a young girl and her family, as well as the baby's father and his family. Common reactions might include anger, guilt and denial. Your teen might also experience anxiety, fear, shock and depression.    Talk to your daughter about what she's feeling and the choices ahead. She needs your love, guidance and support now more than ever.     Discuss the options       A pregnant teen has a variety of options to consider:     Keep the baby.  Many pregnant teens keep their babies. Some marry the baby's father and raise the baby together. Others rely on family support to raise the baby. Finishing school and getting a good job can be difficult for a teen parent, however. If your daughter plans to keep the baby, make sure she understands the challenges and responsibilities involved.   Give the baby up for adoption.  Some pregnant teens give their babies up for adoption. If your daughter is considering adoption, help her explore the different types of adoption available. Also, discuss the emotional impact.   End the pregnancy.  Some pregnant teens choose to end their pregnancies. If your daughter is considering an elective abortion, discuss the risks and emotional consequences. Be aware that some states require parental notification for a legal abortion.     In addition to talking to you, encourage your daughter to talk about the options with the father of the baby and his parents or guardians, her health care provider, or a specialist in pregnancy counseling. Talking to a psychologist or social worker might be helpful, too.   Also, keep in mind that in some states, a pregnant teen is considered to be an emancipated minor who has the right to make her own decision about her pregnancy.

How to quit? Whether stop-smoking products are safe for the baby? Here's what you need to know about smoking and pregnancy. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Smoking and pregnancy don't mix well  but you can take steps to boost your odds of quitting for good. Start by getting answers to the most common questions about smoking during pregnancy.     Does smoking affect fertility?       You probably know the general risks of smoking  from smelly clothes and wrinkles to heart disease and lung cancer.   If you smoke and you're planning to become pregnant, however, you have even more incentive to quit. Smoking appears to have many negative effects on fertility for both men and women, and might make it harder to become pregnant. Smoking is also linked with a greater risk of ectopic pregnancy  when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube.     How does smoking during pregnancy affect a baby?       Smoking during pregnancy exposes a baby to many harmful chemicals, including carbon monoxide. These chemicals limit the baby's supply of oxygen and the delivery of nutrients. Smoking during pregnancy has also been linked with many health problems, including:     Problems with the placenta   A reduction in birth weight   Preterm premature rupture of the membranes  when the amniotic sac leaks or breaks before week 37 of pregnancy   Premature birth   Certain birth defects   Pregnancy loss     Smoking during pregnancy can also affect a baby after he or she is born, increasing the risk of:     Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)   Colic   Asthma   Childhood obesity     Some research also suggests that smoking during pregnancy might affect a child's emotional development, behavior and ability to learn. Smoking during pregnancy might even impair a child's own fertility.     How does exposure to secondhand smoke affect pregnancy?       Breathing secondhand smoke during pregnancy can also affect your baby's health. Women who don't smoke but are exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk of pregnancy loss or having a baby who has a low birth weight or a birth defect.     Can quitting smoking during pregnancy reduce a baby's health risks?       Absolutely. If you smoke, quitting is the best way to give your baby a healthy start. If you quit in the first four months of pregnancy, you might lower your risk of having a low birth weight baby to that of a nonsmoking woman. Quitting smoking can also reduce the risk of premature birth, pregnancy loss, infant death and other complications.   Reducing the amount you smoke during pregnancy is a step in the right direction, but quitting will have the most impact on your health and your baby's health.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         In most cases, the benefits of antiviral flu (influenza) medication during pregnancy outweigh the risks.   During pregnancy, the flu poses a serious threat to your health and your baby's health. Pregnancy increases your risk of developing serious complications of the flu, such as pneumonia. In turn, flu complications increase the risk of premature birth and other pregnancy problems.   Although it's important to be cautious with any medication during pregnancy, research supports the safety of prescription antiviral medication  such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza)  to treat flu during pregnancy.   If you're pregnant and have signs or symptoms of the flu, contact your health care provider right away. He or she will help you decide if an antiviral medication is right for you. If your health care provider prescribes an antiviral medication, remember that the medication is most effective when taken within 48 hours of the first signs or symptoms  although benefits are still possible if the medication is taken later.   If you have a fever, your health care provider might recommend taking acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) as well. Some studies have shown an increased risk of neural tube defects  serious abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord  in the babies of women who experience high fevers during the first four to six weeks of pregnancy.   Remember, a flu shot is the best way to protect yourself and your baby from the dangers of the flu during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a flu shot for anyone who's pregnant during flu season unless you've had a severe reaction to a previous flu vaccination.   When you get your flu shot, be sure to request the flu shot and not the nasal spray vaccine. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus, so it's safe for both mother and baby during any stage of pregnancy. The nasal spray vaccine is made from a live virus, which makes it less appropriate during pregnancy or while you're trying to conceive.         With      Roger W.

Pregnancy ...  ",http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/expert-answers/pregnancy-acne/faq-20058045,"What's the best way to treat pregnancy acne?    Answers from  Lawrence E. Gibson, M.D.         Pregnancy acne can be treated with self-care and medication.   Pregnancy acne isn't a special form of acne. Some women simply seem to have trouble with acne during pregnancy. The likely culprit is an overproduction of oil (sebum)  which happens when certain hormones go into overdrive.   To treat pregnancy acne, start with self-care:     Wash problem areas with a gentle cleanser.  Twice a day, use your hands to wash your face with a mild soap and warm water. Avoid certain products, such as facial scrubs, astringents and masks, because they tend to irritate skin, which can worsen acne. Excessive washing and scrubbing also can irritate skin.   Shampoo regularly.  If you tend to develop acne around your hairline, shampoo your hair every day.   Don't pick or squeeze blemishes.  Doing so can cause infection or scarring.   Avoid irritants.  Don't use oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hairstyling products or acne concealers. Use products labeled water-based or noncomedogenic, which means they are less likely to cause acne.   Watch what touches your skin.  Keep your hair clean and off your face. Also avoid resting your hands or objects on your face. Tight clothing or hats also can pose a problem, especially if you're sweating. Sweat and oils can contribute to acne.     Medication also can be used to treat pregnancy acne but any medication applied to your skin or swallowed during pregnancy can enter your bloodstream and affect your baby. While most ingredients in over-the-counter topical acne treatments haven't been studied in pregnancy, typically only small amounts are absorbed into the skin. This makes it unlikely that the treatments would pose a risk to a developing baby.   Generally, skin treatments containing erythromycin (Erygel) and clindamycin (Cleocin T, Clindagel, others) are considered safe. The safety of using benzoyl peroxide to treat pregnancy acne hasn't been established. This treatment should only be used if clearly needed.   Acne medication known to cause birth defects  including oral isotretinoin (Amnesteem, Claravis) and topical retinoids  must be avoided during pregnancy.   If you're concerned about pregnancy acne, consult your dermatologist or your health care provider. Together you can weigh the benefits and risks of various treatment options.

During pregnancy, exercise can help you stay in shape and prepare for labor and delivery. Here's the lowdown on pregnancy and exercise, from getting started to staying motivated. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Pregnancy might seem like the perfect time to sit back and relax. You likely feel more tired than usual, and your back might ache from carrying extra weight.   But unless you're experiencing complications, sitting around won't help. In fact, pregnancy can be a great time to get active  even if you haven't exercised in a while.     Why exercise during pregnancy?       During pregnancy, exercise can:     Reduce backaches, constipation, bloating and swelling   Boost your mood and energy levels   Help you sleep better   Prevent excess weight gain   Promote muscle tone, strength and endurance     Exercise during pregnancy might also reduce the risk of gestational diabetes.     Pregnancy and exercise: Getting the OK       Before you begin an exercise program, make sure you have your health care provider's OK. Although exercise during pregnancy is generally good for both mother and baby, your doctor might advise you not to exercise if you have:     Some forms of heart and lung disease   Preeclampsia or high blood pressure that develops for the first time during pregnancy   Cervical problems   Vaginal bleeding   Placenta problems   Preterm labor during your current pregnancy   A multiple pregnancy at risk of preterm labor   Premature rupture of the membranes   Severe anemia       Pacing it for pregnancy       For most pregnant women, at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise is recommended on most, if not all, days of the week.   Walking is a great exercise for beginners. It provides moderate aerobic conditioning with minimal stress on your joints. Other good choices include swimming, low-impact aerobics and cycling on a stationary bike. Strength training is OK, too, as long as you stick to relatively low weights.   Remember to warm up, stretch and cool down. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, and be careful to avoid overheating.   Intense exercise increases oxygen and blood flow to the muscles and away from your uterus. In general, you should be able to carry on a conversation while you're exercising. If you can't speak normally while you're working out, you're probably pushing yourself too hard.   Depending on your fitness level, consider these guidelines:     You haven't exercised for a while.  Begin with as little as five minutes of physical activity a day. Build up to 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and so on, until you reach at least 30 minutes a day.   You exercised before pregnancy.  You can probably continue to work out at the same level while you're pregnant  as long as you're feeling comfortable and your health care provider says it's OK.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Antibiotics are commonly prescribed during pregnancy. The specific medication must be chosen carefully, however. Some antibiotics are OK to take during pregnancy, while others are not. Safety depends on various factors, including the type of antibiotic, when in your pregnancy you take the antibiotic, how much you take and for how long.   Here's a sampling of antibiotics generally considered safe during pregnancy:     Amoxicillin   Ampicillin   Clindamycin   Erythromycin   Penicillin   Nitrofurantoin     Certain other antibiotics should be avoided during pregnancy. For example, tetracyclines  such as doxycycline and minocycline  can damage a pregnant woman's liver and discolor a developing baby's teeth.   Also, it's important to note that two antibiotics commonly used together to treat urinary tract infections  trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole  may be linked with an increased risk of birth defects. Although there's no direct proof that these antibiotics cause birth defects, additional research is needed. In the meantime, use of these medications is still warranted in some cases.   If an antibiotic is the best way to treat your condition, your health care provider will prescribe the safest antibiotic at the safest dosage.         With      Roger W.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Stool softeners are generally considered safe during pregnancy.   Pregnancy constipation can be stubborn and uncomfortable. Stool softeners, such as Colace, moisten the stool and make it easier to pass. These products are unlikely to harm a developing baby because their active ingredient is only minimally absorbed by the body. Check with your health care provider, however, before taking any medication  including stool softeners and other types of laxatives  to treat pregnancy constipation.    Also, remember that pregnancy constipation can often be prevented with lifestyle changes. For example:     Drink plenty of fluids.  Water is a good choice. Fruit juice  especially prune juice  also can help.    Include physical activity in your daily routine.  Daily walks and other aerobic activities can help prevent pregnancy constipation.    Include more fiber in your diet.  Choose high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. With your health care provider's OK, consider a fiber supplement, such as Metamucil.      If you take iron supplements, mention the constipation to your health care provider. Although iron is an important nutrient during pregnancy, too much iron can contribute to pregnancy constipation.    If you haven't had a bowel movement in three days, ask your health care provider for a recommendation. If your health care provider approves stool softeners or other types of laxatives, use them as directed.         With      Roger W.

Can I expect any differences in my second pregnancy?    Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Every pregnancy is different  and there's no way to predict what your next pregnancy will be like.   However, during a second pregnancy you might notice a few differences from your first pregnancy, including:     Increased fatigue.  Taking care of your current child while being pregnant and your older age during your second pregnancy might make you feel more fatigued.   Different breast changes.  Your breasts might not be as tender or increase in size as much during your second pregnancy.   Showing earlier.  Many women feel that they show earlier during their second pregnancy. This could be because their prior pregnancy stretched their abdominal muscles.   Feeling the baby move earlier.  You might feel the baby move earlier during your second pregnancy simply because you know what to look for.   Changes in Braxton Hicks contractions.  You might experience more false labor contractions or notice them earlier during your second pregnancy.   Shorter labor.  Labor is likely to be shorter in a second pregnancy.     Also, keep in mind that if you had any complications during your first pregnancy, such as premature birth, hypertension or gestational diabetes, you might be at increased risk in your second pregnancy or later pregnancies. Be sure to talk to your health care provider about signs and symptoms to be aware of and any steps you can take to reduce your risk.         With      Roger W.

Or is sex the last thing on your mind? Either way, here's what you need to know about sex during pregnancy. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you want to get pregnant, you have sex. No surprises there. But what about sex while you're pregnant? The answers aren't always as obvious.   Here's what you need to know about sex during pregnancy.     Is it OK to have sex during pregnancy?       As long as your pregnancy is proceeding normally, you can have sex as often as you like.   However, hormonal fluctuations, fatigue, nausea and breast tenderness early in pregnancy might lower your sexual desire. As your pregnancy progresses, weight gain, back pain and other symptoms might dampen your enthusiasm for sex.   Your emotions can take a toll on your sex drive, too. Concerns about how pregnancy or the baby will change your relationship with your partner might weigh heavily on your mind  even while you're eagerly anticipating the addition to your family.     Can sex during pregnancy cause a miscarriage?       Although many couples worry that sex during pregnancy will cause a miscarriage, sex isn't generally a concern. Most miscarriages occur because the fetus isn't developing normally.     Does sex during pregnancy harm the baby?       Your developing baby is protected by the amniotic fluid in your uterus, as well as the strong muscles of the uterus itself. Sexual activity won't affect your baby.     What are the best sexual positions during pregnancy?       As long as you're comfortable, most sexual positions are OK during pregnancy.   As your pregnancy progresses, experiment to find what works best. Rather than lying on your back, for example, you might want to lie next to your partner sideways or position yourself on top of your partner or in front of your partner. Let your creativity take over, as long as you keep mutual pleasure and comfort in mind.     What about oral and anal sex?       Oral sex is safe during pregnancy. If you receive oral sex, though, make sure your partner doesn't blow air into your vagina. Rarely, a burst of air might block a blood vessel (air embolism)  which could be a life-threatening condition for you and the baby.   Anal sex might be uncomfortable if you have pregnancy-related hemorrhoids. More concerning, anal sex that is followed by vaginal sex might allow infection-causing bacteria to spread from the rectum to the vagina.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   September 4, 2015         Our recent blog post on eating fish during pregnancy prompted one reader to ask why we didn't mention that salmon is high in dangerous PCBs. So what are PCBs and what risk do they pose?   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial chemicals that were manufactured from 1929 until 1979 when they were banned. PCBs have been shown to cause adverse health effects, including potential cancers, and negative effects on the immune, nervous and endocrine systems.   PCB remnants still cycle between air, water and soil, and traces are found all over the world. PCBs settle into water and sediment, where they are taken up by small organisms, fish and animals (including humans) that eat fish. PCBs accumulate in fat and in organs such as liver.   PCBs can pose serious health risks to people who frequently eat contaminated fish. PCBs can be transferred from a mother to her unborn baby, increasing the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. PCBs may also be transferred from mother to baby through breast milk, and exposure has been associated with learning defects.   Fish are the major dietary sources of PCBs, especially fish caught in contaminated lakes or rivers. However, small amounts are also found in meat, dairy products and drinking water.   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets PCB residue limits for foods, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits for lakes, streams and drinking water. In 2004 these agencies came out with guidelines for fish consumption during pregnancy but PCBs weren't mentioned. Nor were they mentioned in last year's draft update of the guidelines. The final guidelines are expected to be released later this year.   However, two other groups, Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP), released fish consumption guidelines that do address PCBs.   The PSR/ARHP guidelines specifically mention the need for caution with fish, such as salmon, that can contain high levels of PCBs. With respect to salmon, the guidelines say:     Canned Pacific salmon can be eaten twice a week   Fresh or frozen wild Pacific salmon can be eaten up to twice a month   Fresh or frozen farmed Atlantic salmon can be eaten once every 2 months     The guidelines also recommend ways to reduce PCB risks in the preparation of salmon and other fatty fish:     Trim fatty areas (belly, top back and dark meat along the side)   Remove or puncture skin before cooking to allow fat to drain off   Broil, grill, roast or steam fish on a rack to allow fat to drain off    Do not fry large fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish      Both sets of guidelines agree that:     The benefits of eating fish outweigh the risks.   Eating a variety of fish is a good way to minimize risks from contaminants.   Because of high levels mercury (another common pollutant), king mackerel, shark, swordfish and tilefish should be avoided.     The bottom line: Eat a variety of fish twice a week and keep the portion size at 6 ounces (170 grams). When you eat fatty fish like salmon, make sure they're prepared using the above guidelines. When you catch your own fish, follow local and state fish advisories for restrictions.       With      Jennifer K.

Understand why you're feeling fatigued and strategies for minimizing discomfort and sleep disturbances. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Pregnancy can take a toll on your body. But as much as you need sleep during pregnancy, it doesn't always come easily. Understand how pregnancy affects sleep and what you can do to rest comfortably.     Why does pregnancy cause fatigue?       During early pregnancy, levels of the hormone progesterone increase and your metabolism is running high and burning energy. This can make you feel exhausted. At the same time, lower blood pressure and increased blood production might team up to sap your energy. If you have another child or children to care for, you might experience even more fatigue.   While fatigue typically lessens after the first trimester, you'll likely feel tired again toward the end of your pregnancy as your baby increases in size.     How does pregnancy affect sleep?       A number of normal symptoms during pregnancy might affect your sleep, including:     Nausea and vomiting   Frequent urination   Anxiety   Back pain   Fetal movement   Leg cramps   Shortness of breath   Heartburn     Changes in your respiratory system during pregnancy can also worsen certain conditions, such as sleep apnea.

Consider seven ways to relieve back pain during pregnancy  from good posture and physical activity to complementary therapies. By Mayo Clinic Staff     Multimedia   Proper lifting during pregnancy   Multimedia   Low back stretch     Back pain during pregnancy is a common complaint  and it's no wonder. You're gaining weight, your center of gravity changes, and your hormones are relaxing the ligaments in the joints of your pelvis. Often, however, you can prevent or ease back pain during pregnancy. Consider seven ways to give pregnancy back pain the boot.     1. Practice good posture       As your baby grows, your center of gravity shifts forward. To avoid falling forward, you might compensate by leaning back  which can strain the muscles in your lower back and contribute to back pain during pregnancy. Keep these principles of good posture in mind:     Stand up straight and tall.   Hold your chest high.   Keep your shoulders back and relaxed.   Don't lock your knees.     When you stand, use a comfortably wide stance for the best support. If you must stand for long periods of time, rest one foot on a low step stool  and take time for frequent breaks.   Good posture also means sitting with care. Choose a chair that supports your back, or place a small pillow behind your lower back.     2. Get the right gear       Wear low-heeled  not flat  shoes with good arch support. Avoid high heels, which can further shift your balance forward and cause you to fall.    You might also consider wearing a maternity support belt. Although research on the effectiveness of maternity support belts is limited, some women find the additional support helpful.     3. Lift properly        When lifting a small object, squat down and lift with your legs. Don't bend at the waist or lift with your back. It's also important to know your limits. Ask for help if you need it.       4. Sleep on your side        Sleep on your side, not your back. Keep one or both knees bent. Consider using pregnancy or support pillows between your bent knees, under your abdomen and behind your back.        Next   Share Tweet   April 05, 2016   References     Bermas BL.

Know how to battle symptoms and stay healthy while getting the job done. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Most women can continue working during pregnancy. Being pregnant, however, might present challenges at the workplace. To stay healthy and productive on the job, understand how to alleviate common pregnancy discomforts  and know when a work task might jeopardize your pregnancy.     Easing nausea and vomiting       It's called ""morning"" sickness, but pregnancy queasiness can hit at any time. To ease nausea at work:     Avoid nausea triggers.  That double latte you craved every morning before pregnancy or the smell of foods reheated in the break room microwave might now make your stomach flip-flop. Steer clear of anything that triggers nausea.   Snack often.  Crackers and other bland foods can be lifesavers when you feel nauseated. Keep a stash at work for easy snacking. Ginger ale or ginger tea might help, too.       Handling fatigue       You might feel tired as your body works overtime to support your pregnancy  and resting during the workday can be tough. It might help to:     Eat foods rich in iron and protein.  Fatigue can be a symptom of iron deficiency anemia, but adjusting your diet can help. Choose foods such as red meat, poultry, seafood, leafy green vegetables, iron-fortified whole-grain cereal and beans.   Take short, frequent breaks.  Getting up and moving around for a few minutes can reinvigorate you. Spending a few minutes with the lights off, your eyes closed and your feet up also can help you recharge.   Drink plenty of fluids.  Keep a water bottle at your desk or in your work area and sip throughout the day.   Cut back on activities.  Scaling back can help you get more rest when your workday ends. Consider doing your shopping online or hiring someone to clean the house or take care of the yard.   Keep up your fitness routine.  Although exercise might be the last thing on your mind at the end of a long day, physical activity can help boost your energy level  especially if you sit at a desk all day. Take a walk after work or join a prenatal fitness class, as long as your health care provider says it's OK.   Go to bed early.  Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Resting on your left side will maximize blood flow to your baby and ease swelling. For added comfort, place pillows between your legs and under your belly.

Answers from Yvonne Butler Tobah, M.D.       Generally, aspirin isn't recommended during pregnancy unless you have certain medical conditions.   Low-dose aspirin  60 to 100 milligrams daily  is sometimes recommended for pregnant women with recurrent pregnancy loss, clotting disorders and preeclampsia.   However, use of higher doses of aspirin poses various risks depending on the stage of pregnancy. During the first trimester, use of higher doses of aspirin poses a concern for pregnancy loss and congenital defects. Taking higher doses of aspirin during the third trimester increases the risk of the premature closure of a vessel in the fetus's heart. Use of high-dose aspirin for long periods in pregnancy also increases the risk of bleeding in the brain of premature infants.   If you need to take aspirin during your third trimester of pregnancy, your health care provider will likely closely monitor you and your baby.    If you need to take a pain reliever during pregnancy, talk to your health care provider about the options. He or she might suggest occasional use of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) instead of aspirin.

Benefits of exercise after pregnancy       Regular exercise after pregnancy can:     Promote weight loss, particularly when combined with reduced calorie intake   Improve your cardiovascular fitness   Strengthen and tone abdominal muscles   Boost your energy level   Relieve stress   Promote better sleep     Better yet, including physical activity in your daily routine helps you set a positive example for your child now and in the years to come.     Exercise and breast-feeding       Exercise isn't thought to have any adverse effects on breast milk volume or composition, nor is it thought to affect a nursing infant's growth. Some research suggests that high-intensity exercise might cause lactic acid to accumulate in breast milk and produce a sour taste a baby might not like; however, this is thought to be rare.   If vigorous exercise is a priority during the first few months of breast-feeding, consider feeding your baby before your workout or pumping before your workout and feeding your baby the pumped breast milk afterward. Alternatively, exercise first and then take a shower, express a few milliliters of breast milk and, after a half-hour or an hour, offer the breast.     When to start       If you had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, it's generally safe to begin exercising a few days after giving birth or as soon as you feel ready. If you had a C-section, extensive vaginal repair or a complicated birth, talk to your health care provider about when to start an exercise program.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Generally, vaccines that contain killed (inactivated) viruses can be given during pregnancy. Vaccines that contain live viruses aren't recommended for pregnant women.   Two vaccines are routinely recommended during pregnancy:     Flu (influenza) shot.  The flu shot is recommended for women who are pregnant during flu season  typically November through March. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus, so it's safe for both you and your baby. Avoid the nasal spray vaccine, which is made from a live virus.   Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine.  One dose of Tdap vaccine is recommended during each pregnancy to protect your newborn from whooping cough (pertussis), regardless of when you had your last Tdap or tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccination. Ideally, the vaccine should be given between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.     Getting the flu shot and the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy can protect you from infection and can also help protect your baby after birth before he or she can be vaccinated. This is important because the flu and whooping cough can be particularly dangerous for infants.   If you're traveling abroad or you're at increased risk of certain infections, your health care provider might also recommend other vaccines during pregnancy  such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines.   Certain vaccines should generally be avoided during pregnancy, including:     Varicella (chickenpox)   Human papillomavirus   Measles, mumps and rubella   Zoster     If you're planning a pregnancy, talk to your health care provider about any vaccines you might need beforehand. Live vaccines should be given at least a month before conception.         With      Roger W.

Answers from Myra Wick, M.D., Ph.D.       Pregnancy and hot tubs can be a risky combination.   Spending 10 minutes or more in a hot tub can raise your body temperature to 102 F (38.9 C), causing a condition known as hyperthermia. Studies have shown an increased risk of neural tube defects  serious abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord  in the babies of women who experience high temperatures during the first four to six weeks of pregnancy. Some studies also suggest that hyperthermia during pregnancy increases the risk of other birth defects and miscarriage, but further research is needed.   If you might be pregnant and plan to use a hot tub, or you choose to use a hot tub during pregnancy, take these steps to reduce the risks:     Limit time in the hot tub to less than 10 minutes.   Avoid sitting near the inlet that provides newly heated water.   Get out of the hot tub if you start to sweat or feel any discomfort.   Stay out of the hot tub if you aren't in good health or you already have an elevated temperature due to fever, exercise, or previous hot tub or sauna use.     If you used a hot tub for a lengthy period of time early in pregnancy, consider talking to your doctor about ways to detect neural tube defects during pregnancy.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Yes.   During pregnancy, increased blood volume and increased production of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) work together to create a pregnancy glow. Greater blood volume brings more blood to vessels, resulting in skin that looks slightly flushed and plump. The hormones HCG and progesterone, which cause the skin glands on the face to secrete more oil, also help make skin look smoother and slightly shinier.   The factors that contribute to pregnancy glow can have a downside, however. If you commonly experienced acne breakouts during your menstrual period before you were pregnant, extra facial oil might make you more prone to acne.         With      Roger W.

Answers from  James M. Steckelberg, M.D.         Yes, it's safe to get a flu shot during pregnancy. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommend that all women who are pregnant during flu season get a flu shot, regardless of their trimester.   A flu shot during pregnancy can help:     Prevent the flu and maternal complications.  Pregnancy affects your immune system, which makes it slightly easier for you to get sick. Pregnant women who become ill from an infection might have a harder time recovering and might have more complications. Getting the flu during pregnancy also increases your risk of developing pneumonia, other respiratory illnesses and becoming hospitalized. A flu shot will decrease your risk of getting the flu during your pregnancy.   Prevent potential pregnancy problems due to the flu.  Flu during pregnancy seems to increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight.   Protect your baby after birth.  Infants are at increased risk of severe flu symptoms, but childhood flu vaccines can't begin until a baby is 6 months old. If you have a flu shot during pregnancy, the antibodies you develop will pass through the placenta to help protect your baby from the flu after birth.     When you get vaccinated, request the flu shot  not the nasal spray vaccine. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus, so it's safe for both mother and baby during any stage of pregnancy. The nasal spray vaccine isn't recommended for use in pregnant women.   While all vaccines carry some risk of adverse effects, such as an allergic reaction, no research has shown an increased risk of complications associated with the flu shot for pregnant women. Women can get the flu shot at any time during pregnancy. There also is no evidence that adverse effects occur in the children of women who receive vaccines with the mercury-based preservative thimerosal during pregnancy. However, it's possible to get a flu shot that doesn't contain thimerosal. Talk to your doctor if you're concerned.         With      James M.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         When you use hair dye or other hair products, a small amount can penetrate your skin. Generally, however, the chemicals aren't thought to pose harm to a developing baby.   While a 2005 study suggested an association between the use of hair dye during pregnancy and the development of the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, other studies haven't reached the same conclusion. Most researchers say it's unlikely that maternal use of hair products before or during pregnancy would increase the risk of childhood tumors.   If you choose to dye your hair during pregnancy, consider these general safety precautions from the Food and Drug Administration:     Follow package directions carefully.   Wear gloves when applying hair dye.   Leave the dye on your hair no longer than directed.   Rinse your scalp thoroughly after using hair dye.     If you're concerned about the use of hair dye during pregnancy, consult your health care provider or consider postponing any chemical hair treatments.         With      Roger W.

Answers from Shannon K. Laughlin-Tommaso, M.D.       Generally, it's safe to continue breast-feeding while pregnant  as long as you're careful about eating a healthy diet and drinking plenty of fluids. However, breast-feeding can trigger mild uterine contractions. Although these contractions aren't a concern during an uncomplicated pregnancy, your health care provider might discourage breast-feeding while pregnant if you're at risk for preterm labor.   If you're considering breast-feeding while pregnant, be prepared for changes your nursing child might notice. Although breast milk continues to be nutritionally sound throughout pregnancy, the content of your breast milk will change  which might change the way your milk tastes. In addition, your milk production is likely to decrease as your pregnancy progresses. These factors could lead your nursing child to wean on his or her own before the baby is born.   Your comfort might also be a concern. During pregnancy, nipple tenderness and breast soreness are common. The discomfort might intensify while breast-feeding. Pregnancy-related fatigue might pose challenges as well.         With     	Shannon K.

Stand at arm's length from a wall, place your hands on the wall in front of you and move your right foot behind your left foot. Slowly bend your left leg forward, keeping your right knee straight and your right heel on the floor. Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds, being careful to keep your back straight and your hips forward. Don't rotate your feet inward or outward and avoid pointing your toes. Switch legs and repeat.   Stay active.  Regular physical activity might help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy. Before you begin an exercise program, make sure you have your health care provider's OK.   Take a magnesium supplement.  Limited research suggests that taking a magnesium supplement might help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy. Make sure you have your health care provider's OK to take a supplement. You might also consider eating more magnesium-rich foods, such as whole grains, beans, dried fruits, nuts and seeds.   Stay hydrated.  Keeping your muscles hydrated might help prevent cramps. Your urine should be relatively clear or light yellow in color if you are properly hydrated. If your urine is darker yellow, it might mean that you're not getting enough water.   Choose proper footwear.  Choose shoes with comfort, support and utility in mind. It might help to wear shoes with a firm heel counter  the part of the shoe that surrounds the heel and helps lock the foot into the shoe.     If a leg cramp strikes, stretch the calf muscle on the affected side. Walking and then elevating your legs might help keep the leg cramp from returning. A hot shower, warm bath, ice massage or muscle massage also might help.         With     	Myra Wick, M.D., Ph.D.         Headaches during pregnancy: What's the best treatment?

Answers from Yvonne Butler Tobah, M.D.       Generally, commercial air travel before week 36 of pregnancy is considered safe for women who have healthy pregnancies. Still, if you're pregnant, check with your health care provider before you fly.   Your health care provider might caution against air travel if you're experiencing pregnancy complications that might be worsened by air travel or require emergency care. The duration of the flight also should be considered. Similarly, your health care provider and many airlines might restrict travel after 36 weeks of pregnancy.   If your health care provider approves air travel and your plans are flexible, the best time to fly might be during your second trimester. This is when the risks of common pregnancy emergencies are the lowest.   When you fly:     Check the airline's policy about air travel during pregnancy.  Guidelines for pregnant women might vary by carrier and destination.   Buckle up.  During the trip, fasten the lap belt under your abdomen.   Promote circulation.  Take occasional walks up and down the aisle. If you must remain seated, flex and extend your ankles often. Also, avoid wearing restrictive clothing. Use of compression stockings might help prevent blood clots.   Drink plenty of fluids.  Low humidity in the cabin can lead to dehydration.   Avoid gassy foods and drinks pre-flight.  Entrapped gases expand at altitude, which can cause discomfort. Examples include broccoli and carbonated drinks.   Make a contingency plan.  Consider how, if necessary, you'll obtain obstetric care during your trip.     Radiation exposure associated with air travel at high altitudes isn't thought to be problematic for most who fly during pregnancy. However, pilots, flight attendants and other frequent fliers might be exposed to a level of cosmic radiation that raises questions during pregnancy. If you must fly frequently during your pregnancy, discuss it with your health care provider. He or she might recommend limiting your total flight time during pregnancy.

For starters, your body retains more fluid during pregnancy. ...  ",http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/expert-answers/swelling-during-pregnancy/faq-20058467,"What causes ankle swelling during pregnancy  and what can I do about it?    Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Various factors contribute to foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy. For starters, your body retains more fluid during pregnancy. Also, your growing uterus puts pressure on your veins, which impairs return of blood to your heart. This can lead to swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. Hormonal changes might play a role as well.   Foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy is common and usually goes away after delivery. In the meantime, it might help to:     Stay off your feet.  Avoid standing for long periods. When you can, sit with your feet up and occasionally rotate your feet at the ankles. Better yet, lie down with your legs elevated.   Sleep on your side.  If you can, sleep on your left side. This takes pressure off the inferior vena cava  the large vein that returns blood from the lower half of your body to your heart. It also might help to elevate your legs slightly with pillows.   Wear compression stockings.  Your health care provider might recommend wearing supportive tights or stockings during the day.   Include physical activity in your daily routine.  Take daily walks, ride a stationary bike or swim laps in a pool.   Stand or walk in the pool.  Although there's little research on the use of water pressure for foot and ankle swelling, standing or walking in a pool seems to help compress tissues in the legs and might provide temporary relief from swelling during pregnancy.   Stay cool.  It might be soothing to apply coldwater compresses to swollen areas.     Some research suggests that foot massages might help decrease foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy. Also, swelling doesn't mean you should cut back on how much you drink. The Institute of Medicine recommends about 10 cups (2.3 liters) of fluids a day during pregnancy.   Although mild foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy is normal, sudden swelling that is painful  especially if it is only in one leg  could be a symptom of a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis). A sudden increase in swelling also might mean that your blood pressure is higher than normal, which could be a sign of preeclampsia. Both conditions require prompt evaluation and treatment.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Dental treatment can be done at any time during pregnancy. However, the best time to perform elective dental treatment during pregnancy is in the second trimester, weeks 14 through 20.   By this time, the development of the fetal organs is complete and the risk of side effects is lower. Research also suggests that women who receive fillings, undergo tooth extractions or have root canal treatment during the second trimester don't experience higher rates of problems at birth. In addition, nausea and postural discomfort are often less of an issue during the second trimester.   Keep in mind that if you have oral pain or swelling, you might need immediate treatment. The consequences of not treating an infection during pregnancy outweigh the possible risks of the medications used during dental treatment. Your health care provider will carefully monitor the use of any antibiotics or pain medications.   If you have questions or concerns about dental care during pregnancy, talk to your health care provider.         With      Roger W.

Now that I'm pregnant, do I need to limit my heart rate while I exercise?    Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         If you exercised regularly before pregnancy, there's no need to focus on your heart rate for exercise during pregnancy.   Years ago, some experts recommended a heart rate of no more than 140 beats a minute for exercise during pregnancy. Today, however, heart rate limits aren't typically imposed during pregnancy. For healthy women, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity  preferably spread throughout the week  without any specific heart rate limits.   Still, reasonable precautions for exercise during pregnancy are important. Get your health care provider's OK for any exercise during pregnancy  especially if you have a history of preterm labor or certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure.    Also, be careful to pace yourself appropriately. In general, you should be able to carry on a conversation while you're exercising. If you can't speak normally while you're working out, you're probably pushing yourself too hard. If you have vaginal bleeding or other unusual signs or symptoms, stop exercising and contact your health care provider.         With      Roger W.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Yes  having an X-ray during pregnancy is generally considered safe. It's highly unlikely that a diagnostic X-ray during pregnancy will harm a developing baby.   Most X-ray exams  including those of the arms, legs, head, teeth or chest  won't expose your reproductive organs to radiation, and a leaded apron and collar can be worn to block any scattered radiation.   The exception is abdominal X-rays, which expose your abdomen  and your baby  to radiation. High doses of radiation can cause changes in a baby's rapidly growing cells. In turn, it's possible that these changes could slightly increase a baby's risk of birth defects or certain cancers, such as leukemia, later in life. Remember, however, that the typical dose of radiation associated with a diagnostic X-ray  even one of the abdomen or pelvis  doesn't pose this risk.   Before having an X-ray, tell your health care provider if you are or might be pregnant. Depending on the circumstances, it might be possible to do an imaging study that doesn't involve radiation. In addition, if you have a child who needs an X-ray, don't hold your child during the exam if you are or might be pregnant.   If you had a diagnostic X-ray before you knew you were pregnant, remember that any potential risk is exceedingly remote. Share any concerns about radiation exposure with your health care provider. He or she might consult a medical radiation physicist to calculate your baby's radiation exposure.         With      Roger W.

Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Allergy medications are sometimes recommended during pregnancy. Before you take any medication during pregnancy, however, it's important to weigh the severity of your symptoms against the possible risks to your baby.   For example, loratadine (Claritin, Alavert) is considered a category B drug  which means that animal studies haven't shown any risks to unborn babies whose mothers take the drug. Other allergy medications in this category include cetirizine (Zyrtec) and budesonide nasal spray (Rhinocort). Although there are no guarantees about safety during pregnancy, drugs in this class are often the best option when medication is needed during pregnancy.   If you're struggling with allergy symptoms, it might help to:     Avoid triggers.  Limit your exposure to anything that triggers your allergy symptoms.   Try saline nasal spray.  Over-the-counter saline nasal spray can help ease symptoms. Use the spray as needed.   Rinse your nasal cavity with a neti pot.  Once or twice a day, fill the neti pot with an over-the-counter saline nasal solution. Then tilt your head over the sink, place the spout of the neti pot in your upper nostril and pour in the saline solution. As you pour, the saline solution will flow through your nasal cavity and out your lower nostril. Repeat on the other side.   Or use water that's distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller. Rinse the neti pot after each use with distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered water. Leave the neti pot open to air-dry.   Include physical activity in your daily routine.  Exercise helps reduce nasal inflammation.   Use nasal strips at night.  Over-the-counter adhesive nasal stripscan help keep your nasal passages open while you're sleeping.   Elevating the head of the bed.  Raising the head of the bed by 30 to 45 degrees might help ease symptoms.     If these tips don't relieve your allergy symptoms, remember that allergy medications aren't necessarily off-limits during pregnancy. Work with your health care provider to choose the safest medication for you and your baby.         With      Roger W.

Understand what to expect and how to renew intimacy with your partner. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Sex after pregnancy happens. Honestly. First, however, vaginal soreness and sheer exhaustion are likely to take a toll. Whether you're in the mood or sexual intimacy is the last thing on your mind, here's what you need to know about sex after pregnancy.     After the baby is born, how soon can I have sex?       Whether you give birth vaginally or by C-section, your body will need time to heal. Consider waiting to have sex until your health care provider gives you the green light  often four to six weeks after childbirth. This allows time for the cervix to close, postpartum bleeding to stop, and any tears or repaired lacerations to heal.   The other important timeline is your own. Some women feel ready to resume sex within a few weeks of giving birth, while others need a few months  or even longer. Factors such as fatigue, stress and fear of pain all can take a toll on your sex drive.     Will it hurt?       Hormonal changes might leave your vagina dry and tender, especially if you're breast-feeding. You might experience some pain during sex if you're healing from an episiotomy or perineal tears, especially extensive tears.   To help ease any discomfort during sex, take it slow. Start with cuddling, kissing or massage. Gradually build the intensity of stimulation. If vaginal dryness is a problem, use a lubricating cream or gel. Try different positions to take pressure off any sore areas and control penetration. You might also discuss alternatives to vaginal intercourse, such as oral or manual stimulation, until healing is complete. Tell your partner what feels good  and what doesn't.   You might also take pain-relieving steps beforehand, such as emptying your bladder, taking a warm bath or taking an over-the-counter pain reliever. If you experience burning afterward, apply ice wrapped in a small towel to the area.   It's also important to focus on the moment. Keep your mind on yourself and your partner  not the diapers, laundry and other household chores.   If sex continues to be painful, consult your health care provider about possible treatment options.     Will it feel different?       After childbirth, decreased muscle tone in the vagina might reduce pleasurable friction during sex  which can influence arousal. This is usually temporary.   To tone your pelvic floor muscles, try Kegel exercises. Simply tighten your pelvic muscles as if you're stopping your stream of urine. Work up to keeping the muscles contracted for 10 seconds at a time, relaxing for 10 seconds between contractions. Once you've got the hang of it, do at least three sets of about 10 Kegel exercises a day.       Next   Share Tweet   July 02, 2015   References     Johnson CE, et al.

I'd rather not take medication.  	Answers from Yvonne Butler Tobah, M.D.       To prevent or relieve mild headaches during pregnancy without taking medication, try the following:     Cool Compress.  Lie down and place a cool compress on your head.   Avoid headache triggers.  If certain foods or odors seem to have triggered your migraines in the past, avoid them. A headache diary might help you identify triggers.   Include physical activity in your daily routine.  Try a daily walk or other moderate aerobic exercise.   Manage stress.  Find healthy ways to cope with the stressors, such as delegating tasks on your to-do list.   Practice relaxation techniques.  Try deep breathing, yoga, massage and visualization.   Eat regularly.  Eating regularly scheduled meals and maintaining a healthy diet might help prevent headaches. Also, drink plenty of fluids.   Follow a regular sleep schedule.  Sleep deprivation might contribute to headaches during pregnancy.   Consider biofeedback.  With this mind-body technique, you learn to control certain bodily functions  such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure  to prevent headaches or reduce headache pain. If you'd like to try biofeedback to treat headaches during pregnancy, ask your health care provider for a referral to a biofeedback therapist.     Keep in mind that most pregnant women can safely take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to treat occasional headaches. Your health care provider might recommend other medications as well. Make sure you have the OK from your health care provider before taking any medication, including herbal treatments.   Headaches during pregnancy are common. However, if you develop a severe headache or a headache that doesn't go away, call your health care provider. Severe headaches can be a sign of a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the kidneys (preeclampsia).

Should I be worried?         Falling during pregnancy can make you panic. But your body is designed to protect your developing baby during pregnancy. Any injury would have to be severe enough to seriously hurt you before it would directly harm your baby.   The walls of your uterus are thick, strong muscles that help keep your baby safe. The amniotic fluid also serves as a cushion. During the early weeks of pregnancy, the uterus is tucked behind the pelvic bone, which provides more protection.   If you do fall during pregnancy, take comfort in knowing that your baby most likely won't be hurt. However, if you're worried about your baby after a fall, see your health care provider.   If you fall later in pregnancy, the concern is that the fall could put you into labor or cause early delivery. Seek immediate medical attention if:     Your fall results in pain, bleeding or a direct blow to the abdomen   You're experiencing vaginal bleeding or leaking amniotic fluid   You feel severe pain or tenderness in your abdomen, uterus or pelvis   You have uterine contractions   You notice a decrease in fetal movement     In most cases, your baby will be fine.

Understand the issues for older mothers  and know what it takes to have a healthy pregnancy. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you're older than 35 and hoping to get pregnant, you're in good company. Many women are delaying pregnancy well into their 30s and beyond  and delivering healthy babies. Taking special care can help give your baby the best start.     Understand the risks       The biological clock is a fact of life, but there's nothing magical about age 35. It's simply an age at which various risks become more discussion worthy. For example:     It might take longer to get pregnant.  You're born with a limited number of eggs. As you reach your mid- to late 30s, your eggs decrease in quantity and quality. An older woman's eggs also aren't fertilized as easily as a younger woman's eggs. If you're older than 35 and haven't been able to conceive for six months, consider asking your health care provider for advice.   You're more likely to have a multiple pregnancy.  The chance of having twins increases with age. The use of assisted reproductive technologies  such as in vitro fertilization  also can play a role.   You're more likely to develop gestational diabetes.  This type of diabetes, which occurs only during pregnancy, is more common as women get older. Tight control of blood sugar through diet and physical activity is essential. Sometimes medication is needed, too. Left untreated, gestational diabetes can cause a baby to grow significantly larger than average  which increases the risk of injuries during delivery.   You're more likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy.  Research suggests that high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy is more common in older women. Your health care provider will carefully monitor your blood pressure and your baby's growth and development. You might need to take medication or deliver your baby before your due date to avoid complications.   You're more likely to have a low birth weight baby and a premature birth.  Premature babies, especially those born earliest, often have complicated medical problems.   You might need a C-section.  Older mothers have a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications that might lead to a C-section delivery, such as placenta previa  a condition in which the placenta blocks the cervix.   The risk of chromosome abnormalities is higher.  Babies born to older mothers have a higher risk of certain chromosome problems, such as Down syndrome.   The risk of pregnancy loss is higher.  The risk of pregnancy loss  by miscarriage and stillbirth  increases as you get older, perhaps due to pre-existing medical conditions or fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Ask your health care provider about monitoring your baby's well-being during the last weeks of pregnancy.     While further research is needed, studies suggest that a man's age at the time of conception his paternal age  also might pose health risks for his children.

By preparing for pregnancy, you can boost the odds of delivering a healthy baby. Here's how. By Mayo Clinic Staff       If you have diabetes  either type 1 or type 2  and you're thinking about having a baby, you might be concerned about the risks. To put your mind at ease, start preparing. Controlling your blood sugar level and making healthy lifestyle choices before pregnancy can help you give your baby the healthiest start.     Start with a checkup       The first step in preparing for pregnancy is to talk to your health care provider.   He or she might recommend:     Changing medications.  If you take oral diabetes medication, you might need to switch to insulin or make other changes to your diabetes treatment plan before you conceive. In addition, some medications  including certain drugs to treat high blood pressure  aren't recommended during pregnancy.   Treatment for certain conditions.  If you have high blood pressure or signs of heart, eye, nerve or kidney disease  or other diabetes complications that could be aggravated by pregnancy  preparing for pregnancy might include treatment before conception.   Consulting with specialists.  Your health care provider might suggest scheduling preconception appointments with an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk pregnancies, a diabetes educator, a registered dietitian or other specialists.       Focus on blood sugar control       Controlling your blood sugar level is the best way to prevent diabetes complications. When you're preparing for pregnancy, blood sugar control is more important than ever. Your health care provider might want you to reach a specific hemoglobin A1C level  a reflection of your blood sugar level for the past two to three months  before pregnancy.   Your baby's brain, spinal cord, heart and other organs begin forming soon after conception, even before you know you're pregnant. If you have poor blood sugar control during the earliest days of pregnancy, your risk of miscarriage and your baby's risk of birth defects  particularly those affecting the brain, spinal cord and heart  increase.    Your health care provider will help you establish your target blood sugar range. He or she will also evaluate your diabetes treatment plan and consider any changes that might be needed to improve it. For example, some women preparing for pregnancy might consider using an insulin pump or increasing the number of insulin injections to improve blood sugar control. The goal is to keep your blood sugar level as close to normal as safely possible.     Keep up a healthy diet       Your diabetes diet probably includes plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. You can eat the same foods while you're preparing for pregnancy. If you're having trouble keeping your blood sugar level in your target range or you want to lose excess pounds before pregnancy, consult a registered dietitian. He or she can help you customize your diabetes meal plan to meet your pre-pregnancy needs.   To help fill any nutritional gaps, take prenatal vitamins that contain folic acid  ideally starting a few months before conception.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   September 4, 2015         Our recent blog post on eating fish during pregnancy prompted one reader to ask why we didn't mention that salmon is high in dangerous PCBs. So what are PCBs and what risk do they pose?   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial chemicals that were manufactured from 1929 until 1979 when they were banned. PCBs have been shown to cause adverse health effects, including potential cancers, and negative effects on the immune, nervous and endocrine systems.   PCB remnants still cycle between air, water and soil, and traces are found all over the world. PCBs settle into water and sediment, where they are taken up by small organisms, fish and animals (including humans) that eat fish. PCBs accumulate in fat and in organs such as liver.   PCBs can pose serious health risks to people who frequently eat contaminated fish. PCBs can be transferred from a mother to her unborn baby, increasing the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. PCBs may also be transferred from mother to baby through breast milk, and exposure has been associated with learning defects.   Fish are the major dietary sources of PCBs, especially fish caught in contaminated lakes or rivers. However, small amounts are also found in meat, dairy products and drinking water.   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets PCB residue limits for foods, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits for lakes, streams and drinking water. In 2004 these agencies came out with guidelines for fish consumption during pregnancy but PCBs weren't mentioned. Nor were they mentioned in last year's draft update of the guidelines. The final guidelines are expected to be released later this year.   However, two other groups, Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP), released fish consumption guidelines that do address PCBs.   The PSR/ARHP guidelines specifically mention the need for caution with fish, such as salmon, that can contain high levels of PCBs. With respect to salmon, the guidelines say:     Canned Pacific salmon can be eaten twice a week   Fresh or frozen wild Pacific salmon can be eaten up to twice a month   Fresh or frozen farmed Atlantic salmon can be eaten once every 2 months     The guidelines also recommend ways to reduce PCB risks in the preparation of salmon and other fatty fish:     Trim fatty areas (belly, top back and dark meat along the side)   Remove or puncture skin before cooking to allow fat to drain off   Broil, grill, roast or steam fish on a rack to allow fat to drain off    Do not fry large fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish      Both sets of guidelines agree that:     The benefits of eating fish outweigh the risks.   Eating a variety of fish is a good way to minimize risks from contaminants.   Because of high levels mercury (another common pollutant), king mackerel, shark, swordfish and tilefish should be avoided.     The bottom line: Eat a variety of fish twice a week and keep the portion size at 6 ounces (170 grams). When you eat fatty fish like salmon, make sure they're prepared using the above guidelines. When you catch your own fish, follow local and state fish advisories for restrictions.       With      Jennifer K.

Is that true?    Answers from  Roger W. Harms, M.D.         Beyond providing nourishment and helping to protect your baby from getting sick, breast-feeding can also help you lose weight gained during pregnancy.   When you breast-feed, you use fat cells stored in your body during pregnancy  along with calories from your diet  to fuel your milk production and feed your baby. Weight loss during breast-feeding can occur even when you follow the recommendations to eat an additional 400 to 500 calories a day to keep up your energy.   However, after an immediate postpartum weight loss of about 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms), weight loss tends to happen gradually  at about 1 to 2 pounds (0.45 to 0.9 kilogram) a month for the first six months after childbirth and more slowly after that point. It often takes six to nine months to lose weight gained during pregnancy.   During breast-feeding, focus on making healthy choices. Opt for a variety of whole grains as well as fruits and vegetables and stay hydrated. If you're trying to lose weight, avoid sources of empty calories, such as soft drinks, desserts, fried foods, whole milk and fatty meats. Moderate physical activity can help, too. If, after six months of breast-feeding, you want to lose more weight, you can more carefully restrict your calories as your baby begins to eat more solid foods.         With      Roger W.

Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.   April 8, 2015         Talking to a woman about her weight during pregnancy  without putting her off from all future pregnancy checkups  is an art. Hopefully I have learned it, but undoubtedly I have offended a few women.   Of course, the reason health care providers stress appropriate weight gain during pregnancy is because it's good for mom and baby  not out of vanity. Recommended weight gain during pregnancy is based on your pre-pregnancy BMI, so lets start our discussion there. Part of having a healthy pregnancy is focusing on your health before you see those life-changing little pink lines.   As obesity has risen in the U.S., so have pregnancy complications. Having a BMI of 30 or more (and especially 40 or more), puts your pregnancy at risk for a long list of complications, including diabetes, high blood pressure and pregnancy loss. Benefits of achieving a healthy pre-pregnancy weight include:     You'll feel amazing   Getting pregnant might be easier   You'll minimize your risk for pregnancy complications     In addition, excess weight is often easier to lose before pregnancy than afterward, when you're busy healing and caring for your baby.   So how do you do it?     Educate yourself by meeting with a dietitian or nutritionist   Choose fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains   Burn calories by getting moving outside or by joining a gym   Make sure loved ones and friends understand and support your goals     Optimal health before pregnancy involves getting chronic illnesses under control, quitting smoking and seeking preconception counseling. Weight management should be on the list, too. Best of all, you can motivate yourself by visualizing a fit, healthy pregnancy!       With      Julie A. Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.

By  Mary M. Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   August 27, 2013          If you're expecting, you want to do what's best for your baby. That means following some basic pregnancy rules  and there's no shortage of people and places recommending them. There are umpteen books, magazines, websites and blogs (including mine) full of pregnancy advice. Family, friends and complete strangers also are more than happy to tell you what you should or should not do during your pregnancy.      Why are there so many pregnancy rules? As knowledge about the human body and pregnancy has grown, so have the cautions health care providers recommend during pregnancy. We warn pregnant women about deli meat, hot tubs, caffeine, and alcohol. We encourage exercise, good nutrition and use of folic acid.      Do health care providers know for a fact that caffeine during pregnancy will significantly increase your risk of miscarriage? Do we have absolute proof that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy will harm your child? No, we don't. The ethics of performing research on pregnant women is tricky territory. Our knowledge largely comes from observations about what has happened in the past or animal studies. We look at previous pregnancies and deliveries. We examine children and what happened during their prenatal periods to draw conclusions. As a result, most of our recommendations are based on potential risks to moms and babies.      If a woman asks me if drinking a glass of wine will harm her baby, I have to answer that we don't know for sure. I can explain that the U.S. Surgeon General recommends complete abstinence because a safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption hasn't been determined. Likewise, if a woman asks about caffeine during pregnancy, I can tell her that studies show there is a relationship between high caffeine use and miscarriage  and that it's probably dose related. However, there aren't 'yes' or 'no' answers for most of these types of questions.      I believe we need more pregnancy research. Your body works differently when you're pregnant. Without research, we won't know if a medication or treatment will be as successful during pregnancy as it is otherwise. I also wish there were absolute rules in pregnancy so you could know that if you did everything just the way you were told, your baby would be born healthy. But I don't think we'll ever get to that point.      In the meantime, I believe it's our responsibility as health care providers to inform pregnant women and their partners about the risks, the likelihood of those risks and the leading experts' recommendations. Then, it's your responsibility to ask questions and decide what's best for you and your pregnancy.         With      Mary M.

Si bien algunas investigaciones sugieren que la covada puede ser frecuente, no es una enfermedad mental reconocida.

Se inform que los sntomas asociados con la covada varan, y generalmente se presentan solo durante el primer y el tercer trimestre de embarazo.     Sntomas fsicos.  Estos sntomas pueden incluir nuseas, acidez, dolor abdominal, hinchazn, cambios en el apetito, problemas respiratorios, dolores de muelas, calambres en las piernas, dolores de espalda e irritaciones urinarias o genitales.   Sntomas psicolgicos.  Estos sntomas pueden incluir cambios en los hbitos de sueo, ansiedad, depresin, disminucin de la libido e inquietud.     Ya sea que la covada sea real o no, lo que es seguro es que convertirse en padre primerizo puede ser emocionante, muy emotivo y estresante.

By  Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.   July 9, 2015         Most health and nutrition experts agree that Americans should increase their consumption of fish. Fish are high in protein and are low in calories, cholesterol and saturated fat.   Some varieties also are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been found to decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke. Omega-3 fatty acids can promote fetal brain development during pregnancy. These benefits come from fatty fish such as salmon, lake trout, herring, sardines and albacore tuna.   Because of these health benefits, the upcoming Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 recommend that adults eat 8 ounces of fish a week. Americans currently eat only half that amount.   It used to be that wild-caught fish were considered healthy. Over the past several decades, however, concerns have arisen about the effects heavy metal contaminants (such as mercury), pollutants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), pesticides, fertilizers and even trash have on the safety of water and fish. The demand for certain types of fish and some fishing practices, such as bottom trolling, have taken their toll on the environment and the availability of fish.   While fish farming (known as aquaculture) has been in place for centuries, its popularity has exploded in recent years because of the above concerns and the continued high demand for fish.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for overseeing U.S. aquaculture, reports that:     Aquaculture supplies more than 50 percent of seafood consumed in the U.S.   About 90 percent of U.S. seafood is imported  half of that is produced by aquaculture   U.S. aquaculture meets only 5 to 7 percent of U.S. demand for seafood     Although modern-day fish farming is designed to address safety concerns, it also has drawbacks. Some pens built in open water can be at the expense of the surrounding ecosystems, such as coastlines, underwater reefs, trees and swamps, and the wildlife that depend on them. Fish that are raised in areas where they're not normally found may escape and breed or compete with local fish  resulting in decreases in the wild species. Fish farms  including those in contained reservoirs  create enormous quantities of organic waste (feces) that can contaminate water in the surrounding environment if not handled properly.   At this time there's no easy answer when it comes to what type of fish to choose  wild-caught or farm-raised. However, to help you navigate the farm versus wild dilemma, here are a few tips:     Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding and young children should avoid tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish and king mackerel.   When buying local fish, check for advice. If information isn't available, adults should limit their consumption to 6 ounces a week, while young children should eat no more than 1 to 3 ounces a week.   Know which fish are overfished and avoid them. This gives at-risk species a chance to repopulate. There are groups that identify which fish are overfished, or caught or farmed in ways that cut the population or harm the environment. These include the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch and the Environmental Defense Fund Seafood Selector. Both have apps you can download.   Buy U.S. fish. The U.S. has strict environmental and food safety laws governing farmed and wild-caught fish. Purchasing U.S. fish is one way you can help ensure safety and sustainability.   Be an advocate. Whenever you purchase fish, ask where it's from and if it's sustainable. Grocers and restaurant owners in turn will question their suppliers and become advocates too.         With      Jennifer K.

Read comments       April 22, 2016 10:53 a.m.   In addition to shrimp and fish raised in very filthy water (e.g. river water for shrimp in Vietnam), what about the use of antibiotics as applied to these concentrated, stressed populations for disease prevention?   Al Schultz       April 22, 2016 7:42 a.m.   I think you could have included Canada when you talked about strict environmental safety.  We too are concerned about having safe food.   Betty       April 21, 2016 9:14 p.m.   When buying farm grown things... Shrimp: they are clear in color and no taste ALWAYS BUY WILD CAUGHT. COME ON THE FARMS ARE FEEDING EITH GMOS   Rach       April 21, 2016 8:21 p.m.   SHOP RITE WHICH IS A SUPERMARKET CHAIN IN PHILA PA ALWAYS DISPLAYS IF THE FISH IS ""WILD CAUGHT OR FARM RAISED"". THEY ALSO DISPLAY WHERE THE FISH IS FROM.   PAT NASUTI       April 21, 2016 4:37 p.m.   Thank you for this report. Although I try to purchase wild caught and shrimp it is some times difficult. I will talk to the fifish monger from now on. Thanks   Mary Ann       April 21, 2016 4:11 p.m.   I buy fish from Sitka Salmon, a seafood CSA that sells fish caught off Alaska. I would call that wild, US fish and I'm sure it's as good as it can be. Also delicious.   Ellen       April 21, 2016 4:03 p.m.   If the public would demand fish that is from the USA and NOT CHINA or India and not buy them I am sure things would change.  The public is not educated or just don't care,   cindi symon       April 21, 2016 3:59 p.m.   cosco has fish and shrimp from India and all the dirty places,where water is not healthty   cindi symon       April 21, 2016 2:30 p.m.   Not very helpful.  Question:  Farm raised or wild caught??  You didn't answer!   Maxine Nelson       March 11, 2016 11:56 a.m.   One important information is that farm raised fish is fed grains and legumes which is typically what fish do not eat. This causes decreased in omega 3 and an increase in omega 6 which causes inflammation.   Bert       December 4, 2015 1:17 p.m.   I would choose wild fish that I've caught myself because its fresh and taste better.   Julianna Frichter       September 8, 2015 11:16 a.m.   I think that reading this article is right about you should buy the fish from the U.S. because they have a environmental program.   Dillan Mitchell       September 5, 2015 7:02 a.m.   From reading labels on frozen salmon I see that farmed salmon is much higher in fat than wild caught and some research shows that Omega 3's are lower. This is a result of their diet similar to the results of grain fed cattle vs grass fed.   Dave       August 13, 2015 8:43 a.m.   I think all fish that are sold in america should be raised in america and not ship in fish from overseas cause who know what they feed there fish with.We have so many fish farms in america for us not to get fish from them to eat.   josh lane       July 30, 2015 10:14 p.m.   Relating to fish and gout: aren't the kinds of fish that are not recommended for gout just the ones that ARE recommended for heart due to Omega-3 content ..  ""Selected seafood. Avoid the following types of seafood, which are higher in purines than others: anchovies, herring, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout, haddock, mackerel and tuna.""   Edith Lueke       July 9, 2015 3:29 p.m.   Here in our Midwest community all the fish that are available for sale in our grocery stores, is Fish from China. I don't buy fish that come from China as I've heard terrible things about how the fish are raised and fed. I wish to support our U.S. fishermen but their fish don't seem to be available to us. I wonder why our fish from our USA fishermen are not available in our grocery stores. Who is getting their fish instead of us???   Barbara Borkowski       July 9, 2015 1:42 p.m.   Farmed fish is contaminated with antibiotics dumped into the water to prevent the diseases associated with ""faming"" fish in confined, unnatural environments. They should be avoided. Wild caught is best. Just shop at a reputable fish monger or grocery and ask questions. It the vendor is a good one, it won't be carrying fish from endangered populations.   Susan       July 9, 2015 12:14 p.m.   Why not list the fish species that are ""overfished"" rather than require the reader to ""research"".  Or, at least put the links to reliable websites.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   July 15, 2014         The most recent advice from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Most women and young children should eat more fish. However, at the same time, they warn about fish dangers. Confused? Read on.   As early as 1994, the FDA alerted the public about mercury contamination of fish. Ten years ago it cautioning those most vulnerable to mercury contamination  women who might become pregnant, women who are pregnant, nursing mothers, their infants and young children. The advice was to avoid these fish due to high mercury content:     Tilefish   Shark   Swordfish   King mackerel     Additional advice includes:     Limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces a week.   Limit other types of fish to no more than 12 ounces a week (adjust the serving size to be appropriate for young children).   When you or others catch your own fish (and you are unaware if there is an advisory on fish caught from the body of water)  limit to 6 ounces a week (adults) or 1 to 3 ounces a week (young children).     Now 10 years later, the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency are again altering their recommendations  but balancing the concern about mercury intake with equal concern about not getting the beneficial nutrients and health effects fish can provide when eaten. Fish contain high quality protein, many vitamins and minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and some contain vitamin D. The nutritional value of fish is especially important during growth and nerve and brain development before birth, in early infancy for breastfed infants, and in childhood.   The new guidelines set a minimum amount of fish to eat. They also provide suggestions for healthier fish choices. Women who might become pregnant, women who are pregnant, nursing mothers and young children should:     Eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week (adjust the serving size to be appropriate for young children).   Choose fish lower in mercury. These include salmon, pollock, tilapia, cod and tuna (including light canned).     The FDA continues to advise avoidance of the four fish listed above because of high mercury content. The FDA also continues to recommend limiting white (albacore) tuna to no more than 6 ounces weekly. The advisory about catching your own fish remains in effect too.   These are subtle, but important changes. Many pre-pregnant, pregnant and nursing women currently consume only about 1.8 ounces of fish a week  when they should be eating 8 to 12 ounces a week. The new advisory helps balance the scales in favor of eating safe amounts of safe fish.       With      Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   January 5, 2016         Longer winter evenings lend themselves to a bit more time at the dinner table. I have fond memories of family dinners when we went around the table with everyone sharing jokes and trivia  and even an occasional confessionary tale.   Here are a few food-related trivia questions that have come up over the years at my family's table:     What's the difference between shrimp and prawn?  Prawns are larger in size and have larger legs with claws on three pairs. Shrimp are smaller and have shorter legs with claws only on two pairs. However, the terms are often used interchangeably, with regional variations. For example, the term ""shrimp"" is used mostly in the U.S., whereas the term ""prawn"" is more common in Europe. In the U.S., the term ""prawn"" may carry the meaning that the shrimp is actually larger in size.   Is it safer to eat raw oysters in months that contain the letter ""r""?  No. At any time of year, raw oysters may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus  which can be life-threatening, even fatal when eaten by people with liver disease or diabetes, pregnant women or individuals with weakened immune systems. While V. vulnificus are found in higher numbers in oysters during warm months, 40 percent of cases of food poisoning from this bacteria occur during colder months (September through April).   What makes chili peppers hot?  The compound responsible for the heat in chili peppers is capsaicin. It's found mainly in the seeds and inner ribs of the pepper, so take care when cutting up peppers. Capsaicin binds to pain receptors in the mouth and skin. Contrary to common belief, water won't put out the burn. Capsaicin is not water-soluble. Instead, reach for oil or detergent to scrub your hands  the oil or detergent will dissolve and wash away the capsaicin. To cool your mouth, drink a glass of milk. The casein proteins in milk act in a similar way and will ease the pain.   Can you cook without heat?  Yes. Tender protein foods such as fish or shellfish may be cooked by soaking in acidic juice or vinegar. This method of chemically cooking the fish tenderizes the protein like heat does. It's thought that this method of cooking originated in ancient Peru, where the fish dish called ceviche is a classic. Be aware, however, that this method does not ensure that harmful bacteria and parasites that can cause food poisoning are destroyed.     Share a few of your food musings. I'm always on the lookout for new ones.   Jennifer       With      Jennifer K.

What we do at our dinner table is make jokes and do funny things just to make each other laugh and have good time! Occasionally we will have a conversation about things that are going on in the world like political news etc. Mostly we just make jokes about things we've seen the past week or show someone a video of a cat falling into a box! Even though we do like to have fun at the table we always say our grace before we eat at the table! Thats should mostly cover all of the ""traditions"" we usually partake in at the dinner table!

By  Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.   July 9, 2015         Most health and nutrition experts agree that Americans should increase their consumption of fish. Fish are high in protein and are low in calories, cholesterol and saturated fat.   Some varieties also are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been found to decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke. Omega-3 fatty acids can promote fetal brain development during pregnancy. These benefits come from fatty fish such as salmon, lake trout, herring, sardines and albacore tuna.   Because of these health benefits, the upcoming Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 recommend that adults eat 8 ounces of fish a week. Americans currently eat only half that amount.   It used to be that wild-caught fish were considered healthy. Over the past several decades, however, concerns have arisen about the effects heavy metal contaminants (such as mercury), pollutants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), pesticides, fertilizers and even trash have on the safety of water and fish. The demand for certain types of fish and some fishing practices, such as bottom trolling, have taken their toll on the environment and the availability of fish.   While fish farming (known as aquaculture) has been in place for centuries, its popularity has exploded in recent years because of the above concerns and the continued high demand for fish.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for overseeing U.S. aquaculture, reports that:     Aquaculture supplies more than 50 percent of seafood consumed in the U.S.   About 90 percent of U.S. seafood is imported  half of that is produced by aquaculture   U.S. aquaculture meets only 5 to 7 percent of U.S. demand for seafood     Although modern-day fish farming is designed to address safety concerns, it also has drawbacks. Some pens built in open water can be at the expense of the surrounding ecosystems, such as coastlines, underwater reefs, trees and swamps, and the wildlife that depend on them. Fish that are raised in areas where they're not normally found may escape and breed or compete with local fish  resulting in decreases in the wild species. Fish farms  including those in contained reservoirs  create enormous quantities of organic waste (feces) that can contaminate water in the surrounding environment if not handled properly.   At this time there's no easy answer when it comes to what type of fish to choose  wild-caught or farm-raised. However, to help you navigate the farm versus wild dilemma, here are a few tips:     Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding and young children should avoid tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish and king mackerel.   When buying local fish, check for advice. If information isn't available, adults should limit their consumption to 6 ounces a week, while young children should eat no more than 1 to 3 ounces a week.   Know which fish are overfished and avoid them. This gives at-risk species a chance to repopulate. There are groups that identify which fish are overfished, or caught or farmed in ways that cut the population or harm the environment. These include the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch and the Environmental Defense Fund Seafood Selector. Both have apps you can download.   Buy U.S. fish. The U.S. has strict environmental and food safety laws governing farmed and wild-caught fish. Purchasing U.S. fish is one way you can help ensure safety and sustainability.   Be an advocate. Whenever you purchase fish, ask where it's from and if it's sustainable. Grocers and restaurant owners in turn will question their suppliers and become advocates too.         With      Jennifer K.

Maxine Nelson       March 11, 2016 11:56 a.m.   One important information is that farm raised fish is fed grains and legumes which is typically what fish do not eat. This causes decreased in omega 3 and an increase in omega 6 which causes inflammation.

I don't buy fish that come from China as I've heard terrible things about how the fish are raised and fed. I wish to support our U.S. fishermen but their fish don't seem to be available to us. I wonder why our fish from our USA fishermen are not available in our grocery stores. Who is getting their fish instead of us???   Barbara Borkowski       July 9, 2015 1:42 p.m.   Farmed fish is contaminated with antibiotics dumped into the water to prevent the diseases associated with ""faming"" fish in confined, unnatural environments. They should be avoided. Wild caught is best. Just shop at a reputable fish monger or grocery and ask questions. It the vendor is a good one, it won't be carrying fish from endangered populations.   Susan       July 9, 2015 12:14 p.m.   Why not list the fish species that are ""overfished"" rather than require the reader to ""research"".  Or, at least put the links to reliable websites.

February 20, 2014         The word is out. Nuts are good for you. A growing body of research supports their role in weight control, heart health and decreasing death from all causes. In addition, most nuts are good sources of fiber, potassium, zinc and iron. So what is the best nut? That depends on your personal preference as well as any health concerns you have. Here are some nutrient highlights to help you choose.     Weight loss or maintenance.  Almonds might be a good choice for you. The combination of protein, fiber and fat is the trifecta of satiety. Add almonds to your breakfast cereal or yogurt, or sprinkle some on your salad later in the day.   Weight gain.  Looking for a healthy way to gain weight? Pecans and macadamia nuts have the most calories in an ounce (that's a handful). Most of these calories come from the abundance of healthy, monounsaturated fats.   Fuel for athletes.  Cashews have more carbohydrates and iron than other nuts. They are good sources of protein and zinc  key nutrients for cell growth and repair. Throw them in your gym bag for a quick snack.    Blood pressure control.  Sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium are major players in blood pressure control. Pistachios and brazil nuts have higher amounts of these heart healthy nutrients. Make a fruit and nut salad.    Pregnancy.  A small handful of nuts when you're not feeling well or feel full too soon is a great source of calories and key nutrients for a growing baby. Among nuts, hazelnuts have the most folate. They also have iron and zinc.   Healthy aging.  Ongoing research on omega-3 fatty acids and their role in brain and heart health should help keep nuts on your radar. Nuts, especially walnuts, are high in polyunsaturated fats. Walnuts, like most nuts, are versatile and can be added to cereal, ground into a butter, or used as a crust or topping on meat, fish, pilafs and vegetables.     The nutrients you get from a small amount of nuts is impressive. Perhaps even more convincing is how easy it is to add these nutrient powerhouses to your diet. It doesn't get much easier than packing a bag in your purse, briefcase or backpack. Just keep an eye on portion size.   How do you enjoy nuts? Have you added nuts to your diet and seen any changes?

Read comments       July 10, 2016 6:02 p.m.   Dear readers,  Thank you for your comments and questions regarding nuts. A serving of nuts is an ounce. One ounce of nuts is roughly 8-25 nuts (49 shelled pistachios = 1 ounce)  and will provide 160-200 calories depending on the nut you choose. Your portion may differ and is okay as along as you are able to balance your calorie intake and level of activity to maintain a healthy weight.  Peanuts are in the legume family with beans, lentils, and peas. All are a good source of plant protein. Like these other plants, peanuts may offer health benefits from fiber, minerals such as iron and zinc, and other phytonutrients.  Like other nuts, peanuts are a good source of healthy fats. 1 ounce of peanuts is about 28 kernels and 160 calories.   Katherine, your blog host       July 5, 2016 9:01 a.m.   I often eat a handful of nuts (usually almonds or Brazil nuts; occasionally cashews or pecans) as my evening meal if I've consumed a complete lunch. They satisfy my slight hunger and carry me through to breakfast. Also, in the past I've found nuts to be an excellent aide in weight loss. I have no scientific backup, but at least in my case I truly believe they helped rev up my metabolism and increased my weight loss.   Janet       July 4, 2016 3:07 p.m.   Great article! Peanuts are not nuts, but how do they compare to nuts and where do they fit the article?   Gordon - gemenuz@shaw.ca       July 4, 2016 1:57 p.m.   Thanks for a really great article, Katherine!

I found that if I increased the amount little by little, they went away and my body got used to it.  I now put them in everything; cereal, salad, snacks, yogurt, etc.  They have made my cholesterol go down and it's because of the high Omega-3. What can be better than adding walnuts with chocolate? Brownies without walnuts are BORING!  To me, pairing walnuts with anything chocolate makes the flavor come alive.  To your health!

Brazil,almonds,cashews,walnuts,macadamia nuts. This keeps me going strongly until my light lunch. I feel strong for my 73 years. I do worry about being able to buy FRESH nuts.

Jan Tunstall       April 14, 2016 2:24 p.m.   I used to take almonds as first thing in the morning. After my blood test results showed potassium level of 6 & my doctor told me to cut on foods with potassium. I noticed that foods like almonds, avocado, carrots etc. contained potassium and was cautious & these items. Unfortunately the labels on food containers don't show potassium content often. I thought it was safe that way, may be. Please advise.

Added to that are a few almonds and walnuts.  Possibly the nuts are the reason I'm not on any prescriptions at the age of 86.   Renie       July 14, 2015 1:49 a.m.   I love nuts.  Almonds, pecans, walnuts.  I also love peanuts but can't have them as I am allergic to mold and peanuts are grown in mold.  I buy organic nuts and nut butters....esp. crunch almond butter and pecan butter...though pecan butter comes one way: smooth.

To break through a plateau, you'll need to tip the energy balance by cutting back more on calories or burning more calories by increasing your exercise. By Jessica Holst             Most people experience a plateau at some point during their weight-loss journey. Plateaus may last a few days to a few weeks and sometimes even a few months.   Rather than get discouraged when the scale seems stuck, try to think of this minor setback as a reminder of the great things you've been doing. Plateaus occur when you've been consistent with healthy eating and exercising. They're your body's way of saying, ""I've mastered what I've been doing. I need to change things up and challenge myself!""   So, what exactly happens when you reach a plateau? First, look at weight change in the big picture. Your body needs a certain amount of energy, in the form of calories, just to live  for breathing and other normal organ functions. This is your metabolism or resting metabolic rate. Your body also uses energy to digest food and do basic activities, such as listening to music or reading a book, and to exercise.     A smaller tank to fill       Here's another way to look at a weight-loss plateau: Think of your body as you would a vehicle. To lose weight, you have to cut back on calories or increase your physical activity so that you burn more calories. Doing both is ideal. Over time, as you lose weight, your body doesn't need as many calories to function because there's less of you.   You can compare the energy your body needs to the fuel in your vehicle. A large SUV needs more fuel to fill its tank than a compact car does. As you lose weight, your vehicle (in this case, your body) needs less fuel  fewer calories  to make it operate. That means you'll need to adjust if you want to lose more weight. To break through a plateau, you'll need to tip the energy balance by cutting back more on calories or burning more calories by increasing your exercise. This could be as easy as skipping second helpings at dinner or taking the stairs instead of the elevator as often as you can. Small changes really do add up.

January 25, 2017         Fish are getting more attention in an American diet that is dominated by land animals. Why the focus on eating more seafood?   Fish and other seafood are lean sources of protein and good sources of minerals such as selenium, zinc, iodine, iron and B vitamins. Fatty fish have the additional benefits of healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A and D.   Yet many Americans are missing out on these benefits. Part of the reason may be confusion over mercury contamination and which types of fish are best avoided.   To help you navigate these murky waters, the Food and Drug Administration released ""Eating Fish: What Pregnant Women and Parents Should Know."" This guide provides advice suitable for everyone  men, women and children  on getting the nutritional benefits of fish while minimizing exposure to contaminants such as mercury.   The guide has three categories and recommendations of how much to eat:     Best choices  (eat 2-3 servings a week): anchovies, canned light tuna, cod, haddock, perch, salmon, sardines, scallops, shrimp, tilapia, trout, whitefish   Good choices  (eat 1 serving a week): albacore (white) tuna, ahi (yellowfin) tuna, bluefish, carp, grouper, halibut, mahi-mahi, snapper, striped bass, tilefish (Atlantic Ocean)   Avoid : bigeye tuna, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish (Gulf of Mexico)     Serving sizes are determined by age:     Children 2-3 years of age: 1 serving is 1 ounce (28 grams)   Children 4-7 years of age: 1 serving is 2 ounces (56 grams)   Children 8-10 years of age: 1 serving is 3 ounces (84 grams)   Adults and children 11 years of age or older: 1 serving is 4 ounces (112 grams)     Should you be worried if you ate a fish from the ""avoid"" list? No, but be sure to choose fish from the ""best"" and ""good"" categories going forward.   If you fish in and eat from local waters, follow fish advisories for that area. If no data is available, limit to 6 ounces of that fish a week for adults. For children under 6 years of age, limit to 1-2 ounces (28-56 grams). For those 6-12 years of age, limit to 2-3 ounces (56 to 84 grams).   Don't let the worry of contaminants take the enjoyment out of fishing and enjoying fish. Follow the advisories and the recommendations to regularly include fish in your diet.   Fish can be simple to prepare, making for a quick and nutritious meal. Fresh and pan seared, frozen and baked, or out of can and in a sandwich, there are options for every palate.

But that doesn't mean it's too late to adopt new, healthy habits. By Angela L. Murad             Making healthy changes doesn't require you to completely overhaul your diet. Start at your own pace by practicing these key healthy-eating habits.     Eat breakfast       Research indicates that eating breakfast every day helps with weight loss and weight maintenance by reducing hunger later in the day. When you break the overnight fast with a healthy breakfast, it's easier to resist unhealthy choices during the day.   Include at least two food groups  such as whole grains, lean protein, dairy, or fruits and vegetables  at breakfast to put you on track for a day of healthy eating.     Drink water       Water is a crucial nutrient that often gets overlooked. Sixty percent of your body weight is made up of water and every system in your body requires it to function properly. Fluid needs depend on several factors: your health, your environment, how active you are, and if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men need about 13 8-ounce cups of water a day and women need nine 8-ounce cups of water a day.   Sometimes thirst can be misinterpreted as hunger. Check in with your body when you feel hungry, especially later in the day. Drinking a glass of water before eating can satisfy thirst and keep you from eating unnecessary calories.

By  Mary M. Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   January 7, 2012            When I was pregnant with my son more than 20 years ago, prenatal genetic screening was a relatively new thing  and the options were limited. Today, prenatal genetic screening for Down syndrome and certain other conditions has become standard practice. Prenatal genetic screening isn't required, however, and the results aren't conclusive. This might leave you wondering whether you should do one test, two tests  or perhaps no tests.     Start by considering how likely you are to have a baby with Down syndrome. Think about your age  since the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is higher for older mothers  as well as your family history. If you're unsure, consult your health care provider or a genetic counselor.     Then consider what you'll do with the test results. Prenatal genetic screening tests  such as first trimester screening or the quad screen  involve a blood sample from the mother and, for first trimester screening, an ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid in the tissue at the back of the baby's neck. These tests don't pose any risks for your health or your baby's health. However, they can only tell you if the risk of Down syndrome or certain other conditions is higher than normal. They can't tell you with certainty if your baby does or doesn't have a chromosomal disorder. That requires invasive testing, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling  both of which carry a slight risk of pregnancy loss. A new blood test for Down syndrome is now available in some areas, but a positive result still requires confirmation by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.     Before you agree to prenatal genetic screening, ask yourself some questions. How important is the reassurance of a negative or normal screening test? If the results of a screening test are positive or worrisome, will you choose a more invasive diagnostic test that carries a possibility of losing the baby? Would a firm diagnosis affect how you handle the pregnancy or prepare for the baby? If you opt out of further testing, how will you handle the uncertainty about your baby's health?     These are tough questions that demand serious thought. There's no right answer  only the answer that's right for you.          With      Mary M.

Plz suggest   Pratima Devi       June 13, 2013 1:51 p.m.   Brittany, I can understand your concern.  The type of testing I talked about here would not be able to tell you about CVID.  It might help if you were able to consult with a medical gentics specialist.  They would be able to review your medical history and give you detailed information.   Mary@Mayo       June 7, 2013 12:14 p.m.   My fiance and I are considering trying to conceive, and I've started to read up on how to eat to prepare and like that. But I was wondering, do these tests (before the amino) show risks for blood disorders? I had a blood disorder growing up, I was born with it, and its genetic. I've always wanted to be a mother but terrified that my children would have my blood disorder and have to go through what I did. I already know a child of mine since I have (remission but they never consider it fully gone since it can come back fast) C.V.I.D would have a 1 in 4 chance of getting it. But I wanted if anyone was able to tell me if it could show blood disorder results, if so what were your if they were at risk? Thank you, you'll be canning my mind a bit.   Brittany       March 27, 2013 6:30 a.m.   Gracie, I'm sure this is hard for all of you. There are tests that will be able to help diagnosis the problem with the baby.  An amniocentesis is when a thin needle is inserted into the uterus and a small amount of amniotic fluid is withdrawn and then tested for chromosomal abnormalities.  There is also a blood test that can be done for specific chromosomal disorders.  Some abnormalities aren't a result of chromosomal problems.  A advanced level ultrasound can often help with the diagnosis of problems with the baby.  I hope you, your son and daughter-in-law get the answers you need as well as some pictures of the baby.   Mary@Mayo       March 22, 2013 5:18 p.m.   My son and Daughter in law are expecting their first child.  Just had their first ultrasound at 22 weeks and were told that the baby has low brain development and alot of water on the brain.  Not much else was said and referred to a specialist next week.  They weren't even given pics at the ultrasound to look at. Does anyone know what this means and if an amnio test will help diagnosis?    gracie       December 3, 2012 12:05 p.m.   There are new blood tests that look at the DNA of the baby that is in the mothers blood.  Currently these tests are not considered diagnostic by themselves.  It is still recommended by the companies that manufacture the tests that an amniocentisis or CVS be done to confirm the results. I would recommend speaking with your health care provider about the tests before deciding about the 1st trimester screen.   mary @ Mayo       November 26, 2012 2:57 p.m.   I recently went through what I now realize should be called The Nuchal Translucency Scare. I have read countless postings of women who were given false positives and go through days and weeks of heartache and then feel they have to take the risk of a 1:300 chance of miscarriage with a CVS or amnio test to confirm or rule out. I have seen false positive rates of 5% (what the doctors will tell you) to 80% (closer to actual).  I HIGHLY recommend forgoing this test and taking the new Harmony test instead. It has been on the market for just 8 months now, and is non-invasive requiring only a blood test. IT IS 99.9% ACCURATE and blows away the NT test for this reason and makes the need for a CVS or amnio follow-up unnecessary.  Our clinic unfortunately seemed to be motivated more by the fact that they receive more money for the NT screening process than for Harmony. We had to work hard to get information from them but luckily was able to get this. SUPER relieved to go from 1:38 to 1:10,000 chance!   Syd       October 17, 2012 2:00 p.m.   Gilly, yes, there are less invasive options available.  The MaterniT21-plus test is a blood test that can be done, I believe, as early as 10 weeks.  The test can diagnose Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13.  I don't know how far along you are, but another option is to wait until your anatomy ultrasound and if there are concerns at that time, then maybe you want to consider the MaterniT21-Plus test vs an amnio.  I can't stress enough that if you are having concerns, talk to your doctor.  If they don't have the information you are looking for, have them refer you to the ob genetic counselor or to a high risk doctor for a consult (I highly recommend Dr. Karl Rose, he is a fountain of knowledge and so compassionate).     Vanessa       September 21, 2012 5:37 p.m.   I just took the tests as i was asked to without thinking about the stress, my blood came back with a 1 in ten chance and i do not know what to do about invasive tests that could make me micarrage a healthy baby do i have any other option    gilly       September 17, 2012 3:34 a.m.   I am 34 as of 08-12 and almost 20 weeks pregnant. My anatomy scan showed a hot spot on the baby's heart and they said his femur is .01mm short compared to the size of his head. Everything else is normal or above average. I took a blood test called the Harmony test and am waiting on the results now. But I'm still going crazy and I can't get nothing done because this is all I think about.

By  Julie A. Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.   August 3, 2016         Chances are you've heard of the trend of women eating their placenta after giving birth (placentophagy). It's often done by drying the placenta, grinding it up and making it into capsules for the new mother to consume during the first postpartum weeks. Supporters of the practice say that it helps with postpartum depression, bleeding, energy, pain and milk supply.   The placenta is an intricate organ that begins forming at the moment of implantation  when the fertilized egg burrows into the wall of the uterus. The organ nourishes the growing fetus by exchanging nutrients and oxygen for waste products via the umbilical cord. Its development and function is nothing short of amazing. Is there usefulness, however, to the placenta after birth?   Supporters point to research that suggests benefits for postpartum women. But these studies tend to lack in convincing evidence. They focus on animal research and anecdotal experiences or they're poorly designed. To date, there is no reliable research on humans that supports the benefits of placentophagy. (Hint: Let's get some!)   Several animals eat their placenta. Although it's not exactly clear, it's possible that the placenta gives them ready access to nutrition after the tiring process of birth and helps them hide evidence of a recent birth from predators. In other words, this act serves needs that humans haven't had in a long time.   Until the proven benefits or harms of consuming your placenta are clear, use caution. If you decide to proceed, do your own research to ensure that the placenta processor (say that ten times fast) has been trained and certified. Careful processing is a necessity because placentas carry blood-borne diseases.   Whether the idea of eating your placenta sparks your curiosity or turns your stomach, you have to agree that the placenta is a pretty cool organ. After your baby is born and you have had the chance to snuggle, admire and bond with your little one, ask your provider to show you the organ and give you a little Placenta 101. It was, after all, your baby's lifeline for all those months!       With      Julie A. Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.

By  Mary M. Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   February 9, 2011          I'd like to think that I have a perfect diet. However, I'm well aware of the M&Ms that pass my lips every day, and I could stand to eat more iron-rich foods. You're probably in touch with your own diet shortcomings, too. During pregnancy, though, you're likely to become more conscious of what and how much you eat. Enter prenatal vitamins.     I'm not sure of many pills larger than traditional prenatal vitamins. Here's a pregnant woman, fighting nausea and expected to swallow a pill the size of her thumb and then keep it down! Still, prenatal vitamins help you get enough folic acid, iron and other essential nutrients. If you're on a special diet  such as gluten free, vegetarian or vegan  or have other specific needs, your health care provider may recommend other nutritional supplements.     There's an important caveat, though. Prenatal vitamins aren't meant to replace the nutrients you get from food. They just make sure you don't fall short on key nutrients.     If you're having trouble taking prenatal vitamins  or keeping them down  it might help to take the vitamins at night or with a snack. You might also chew gum or suck on hard candy afterward. If the vitamins seem to make you constipated, remember to drink plenty of water. It might also help to include more fiber in your diet and get regular physical activity.

Read comments       July 1, 2011 6:27 a.m.   Matthew, you are right that most vitamins have the same supplements as prenatal vitamins.  It is often the amounts that are different so look at both things.  The folic acid is most important.  Regarding protein other than meat such as eggs, peanut butter, soy milk, yogurt and beans.  Often our preferences change with pregnancy so she may turn out to love milk during pregnancy.  Good luck.   mary @ Mayo       June 21, 2011 6:38 p.m.   Hi Mary,  My wife and I are in the planning stages of her pregnancy. I'm trying to figure out the best pre-natal vitamins for her. I've noticed that many multi-vitamins have the same supplements as the pre-natals, plus additional vitamins and minerals. Should she be taking both? One over the other? Another wrinkle, she does not really eat meat ever (not a vegetarian, just doesn't like meat) and I've never seen her drink milk. What should I do to make sure she's getting optimal nutrition leading up the pregnancy? I admit, I will over-obsess about this, but hey, that's my job as her husband.

I think you can take 2 tablets of 400mcg a day if you would like. Mary-Ann, you should be taking a prenatal supplement every day.

February 20, 2014         The word is out. Nuts are good for you. A growing body of research supports their role in weight control, heart health and decreasing death from all causes. In addition, most nuts are good sources of fiber, potassium, zinc and iron. So what is the best nut? That depends on your personal preference as well as any health concerns you have. Here are some nutrient highlights to help you choose.     Weight loss or maintenance.  Almonds might be a good choice for you. The combination of protein, fiber and fat is the trifecta of satiety. Add almonds to your breakfast cereal or yogurt, or sprinkle some on your salad later in the day.   Weight gain.  Looking for a healthy way to gain weight? Pecans and macadamia nuts have the most calories in an ounce (that's a handful). Most of these calories come from the abundance of healthy, monounsaturated fats.   Fuel for athletes.  Cashews have more carbohydrates and iron than other nuts. They are good sources of protein and zinc  key nutrients for cell growth and repair. Throw them in your gym bag for a quick snack.    Blood pressure control.  Sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium are major players in blood pressure control. Pistachios and brazil nuts have higher amounts of these heart healthy nutrients. Make a fruit and nut salad.    Pregnancy.  A small handful of nuts when you're not feeling well or feel full too soon is a great source of calories and key nutrients for a growing baby. Among nuts, hazelnuts have the most folate. They also have iron and zinc.   Healthy aging.  Ongoing research on omega-3 fatty acids and their role in brain and heart health should help keep nuts on your radar. Nuts, especially walnuts, are high in polyunsaturated fats. Walnuts, like most nuts, are versatile and can be added to cereal, ground into a butter, or used as a crust or topping on meat, fish, pilafs and vegetables.     The nutrients you get from a small amount of nuts is impressive. Perhaps even more convincing is how easy it is to add these nutrient powerhouses to your diet. It doesn't get much easier than packing a bag in your purse, briefcase or backpack. Just keep an eye on portion size.   How do you enjoy nuts? Have you added nuts to your diet and seen any changes?

Read comments       July 10, 2016 6:02 p.m.   Dear readers,  Thank you for your comments and questions regarding nuts. A serving of nuts is an ounce. One ounce of nuts is roughly 8-25 nuts (49 shelled pistachios = 1 ounce)  and will provide 160-200 calories depending on the nut you choose. Your portion may differ and is okay as along as you are able to balance your calorie intake and level of activity to maintain a healthy weight.  Peanuts are in the legume family with beans, lentils, and peas. All are a good source of plant protein. Like these other plants, peanuts may offer health benefits from fiber, minerals such as iron and zinc, and other phytonutrients.  Like other nuts, peanuts are a good source of healthy fats. 1 ounce of peanuts is about 28 kernels and 160 calories.   Katherine, your blog host       July 5, 2016 9:01 a.m.   I often eat a handful of nuts (usually almonds or Brazil nuts; occasionally cashews or pecans) as my evening meal if I've consumed a complete lunch. They satisfy my slight hunger and carry me through to breakfast. Also, in the past I've found nuts to be an excellent aide in weight loss. I have no scientific backup, but at least in my case I truly believe they helped rev up my metabolism and increased my weight loss.   Janet       July 4, 2016 3:07 p.m.   Great article!

I found that if I increased the amount little by little, they went away and my body got used to it.  I now put them in everything; cereal, salad, snacks, yogurt, etc.  They have made my cholesterol go down and it's because of the high Omega-3. What can be better than adding walnuts with chocolate?

After my blood test results showed potassium level of 6 & my doctor told me to cut on foods with potassium. I noticed that foods like almonds, avocado, carrots etc. contained potassium and was cautious & these items. Unfortunately the labels on food containers don't show potassium content often.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   May 14, 2013          Juicing fruits and vegetables has become popular among health and fitness buffs. However, some people must juice  or blend  foods because they have medical problems that prevent them from eating solid foods. These problems may include tooth extraction or jaw trauma, diseases, cancer treatment, or obstructions or surgeries that inhibit chewing, swallowing, digesting and absorbing solid foods.      If you're following a liquefied diet because of a medical problems, consult your physician or a registered dietitian about what foods you can and can't have. In some cases, commercially prepared liquid meal replacements may be indicated.      Here are some key points to remember for safe juicing and blending:       Nutritional completeness . If you're relying on liquified foods in place of meals, you need to ensure that what you're drinking replaces those meals nutritionally. This is especially true when you have a medical condition that changes your nutritional needs. The longer you need to follow a liquid diet, the more importance it is that what you juice or blend is nutritionally sound.   Food safety . Make sure that everything you juice or blend is free from contamination. Raw vegetables and fresh fruit should be cleaned or precooked. Meats, poultry and fish should be cooked to proper temperatures before blending. Very young children, pregnant women, older adults and those with medical problems that weaken the immune systems are at the most risk for food poisoning. They should avoid unpasteurized milk and juices, raw eggs (eggs pasteurized in the shell are OK), and raw meat, fish and poultry. Some medical conditions, such as cancer or organ transplant, will require more stringent food restrictions.   Equipment . The ideal juicer or blender will include the pulp for consumption. Equipment should be easy to clean. Bits and grits of lodged food will grow bacteria. Ideally the equipment can go into a dishwasher for sanitizing, or be easily scrubbed.   Quantity . Blend only what you can consume at one meal. If you make more, refrigerate what you don't consume in clean covered containers. Use within 24 hours or discard.   Technique . Fill the juicer or blender only one-third to one-half full and process on low speed to prevent overflow. Important: Hot foods cause steam. Hot splashes may come through the feeder slot  or the lid may lift off. Vent the lid or feeder slot to allow steam to escape  cover the space with a clean towel to protect your hands from splashes.      - Jennifer         With      Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.

Don       May 24, 2013 12:39 a.m.   I started to juice in late Feb. At first just replacing one meal then after 1 month, replaced lunch or dinner with a juice drink. I usually used 1/2 greens e.g. Kale and half a mix of fruits and added some nuts or seeds for protein. To my surprise, in May when I had my fasting sugar and cholesterol checked my AIC was 5.9% and cholesterol went from 248 to 204! Lower than I've been in 30 years.    Mary       May 23, 2013 9:20 p.m.   I pureed food for myself when I had mouth and throat sores during chemotherapy. I pureed meat and potatoes with buttermilk. I did vegetables the same way but separately. You can try mashing pancakes with syrup...they really don't come out that well. Cereals I liked, I soaked in milk then pureed as needed. I generally switched to oatmeal.

For that, a food processor works best, because it is more powerful than a typical blender. One meal example is a puree of cooked chicken, mixed with mashed potatoes, and thinned with half and half.(I do the cooking/pureeing) I hope you do an article about pureed diets in the future. I still haven't figured out how to make things, like pancakes/waffles, edible.   jOHN       May 22, 2013 12:00 p.m.   What about apple seeds?

Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   December 17, 2009          One of my earliest memories is of my mother nursing my youngest brother  yet when I started my medical career as a nursing assistant at age 16, breastfeeding wasn't the norm. There were no lactation consultants and women weren't offered much help breast-feeding their babies. At the time, parents were quick to offer formula.      During my years as a labor and delivery nurse, breast-feeding began to increase in popularity. Still, no one ever told me how difficult breast-feeding could be. When I breast-fed my own baby, I naively accepted everything that happened as the norm  even though my nipples were so tender that I'd cringe every time the baby latched on. I thought that I had a baby and two breasts, so everything should be easy. I was embarrassed to admit that I didn't know what I was doing, so I just plowed ahead. It wasn't until much later that I realized how lucky I was to be able to stick with it and be successful.      I think one of the biggest pieces of information that is too often not passed on to new moms is that breast-feeding isn't easy for at least the first two weeks. Nothing can really prepare your nipples for a nursing baby. Babies are born knowing how to suck, but they don't know how to suck on a breast. If this is your first baby, you may not be comfortable holding a baby  let alone putting a baby to your breast. And since breasts don't have ounce markers, you never know for sure how much milk the baby is getting.      If you're planning to breast-feed your baby, don't hesitate to ask for help. Most hospitals have lactation consultants on staff who can answer your questions or help you resolve any problems you may encounter. Remember, just as your body knows what it's doing during pregnancy and childbirth, your body knows how to support a breast-feeding baby. Have faith in your body's ability to meet your baby's nutritional needs.         With      Mary M.

My milk supply dried up due to stress at work and not enough time to pump while at work. I also had excruciating pain for the first few months of nursing. I recently gave birth to my son (8 weeks ago) and he has been so different. I had to go one weekend of having him on a bottle instead of nursing.  Now he is super fussy on the breast.  I am using a nipple shield and that seems to help but I am not producing enough milk to send to daycare for the day.  I am getting a bit stressed.  I visited with a lactation consultant who had told me about the shield.  Another thing she told me about, that I was never told, was that there are different size flanges for my breast pump!  I bought a bigger size flange and they have been much more comfortable than the size that came with the pump.  I was able to pump enough milk in the first 2 weeks to put in the freezer but now I have had to start using those because I am not producing enough in a day. Does tiredness have anything to do with my milk supply?  Is it ok to do formula and breast milk? How / when to rotate the two? I am trying to hang in there but am quickly getting discouraged.  My spouse doesn't seem to understand what I am going through or feeling.     Amy       October 23, 2012 2:12 p.m.   @ Judy. I went through the same exact thing as you did. I pumped and supplemented as well and it allowed me to pump enough milk for 2 days at a time. Yes it can be a pain when ur hooked up to a machine, but if you're able to pump and store, it works as well.  After 6 months I decided that formula was gonna be my final choice. Don't listen to what others have to say as its all opinions and everyone experience(s) are different.   Tajuana       August 21, 2012 3:28 p.m.   Oh thank goodness for all you moms out there who shared your story - my daughter is 17 days old and breastfeeding has been a horrid. My nipples were cracked, red, raw from the beginning. Hospital lactation consultants told me my baby's latch was perfect, my nipples just needed to toughen up. Yeah - 48 hours later I was still breastfeeding and literally biting into a hand towel to scream because the pain was so excruciating. I ended up going to 4 breastfeeding classes led by an RN/IBCLC and I was given OTC ointment to heal the nipples and pumped and bottle fed (supplementing with formula if needed) while my nipples healed. I just tried breastfeeding again today and the pain was still excruciating. After crying literally everyday, I decided today no more breastfeeding and I'll have to continue to pump. My husband is wonderful and feeds our daughter a bottle while I pump each time. I'm hoping my milk supply will increase soon as we literally cannot leave the house b/c I have to pump. I've come THIS close to quitting and just going to formula but I'll keep on pumping and feeding our daughter breastmilk as long as I can.  I'm tired of so many people and articles quoting 'breast is best' that i felt like a failure and inadequate mother b/c I was pumping. After talking to several of my girl friends (who are mothers) it's helped me realize not all babies are the same and I'm doing the best I can for my child and if that means bottles with occasional formula - so be it.     Judy       June 23, 2012 3:51 p.m.   My baby is 9 1/2 months old and I'm still breastfeeding him and plan on breastfeeding him til he is a year old. He's never had formula. I've been told by doctors and nurses how good of a job I've been doing breastfeeding. He is at a healthy weight and is growing great. Breastfeeding for me has been the best thing I've ever done. It was hard for the first two weeks but after that it was really easy for me. Breastfeeding is great because you never have to make bottles, you can just go out the door with your baby and milk is already ready for you at anytime! It's great for night time feedings because you never have to get up and make a bottle you just got to pick up your baby and put him in bed with you and feed him. I think breastfeeding is great for mom and baby. I lost my baby weight real fast after my son was born because of breastfeeding! And I know I'm doing the best for my baby! So good job to all the mom's breastfeeding there baby's!!!!!!   Terri       May 17, 2012 4:45 a.m.   Jerome is now 3 weeks old. My 1st attempt resulted in a blister on my nipple. I could not latch him properly on the left, I dreaded feeds. Premature, we needed to dig him up to feed every 3 hours. I saw a lactation consultant who helped with the latch, and it doesn't hurt anymore, but seriously, knowing he wets 6-8 diapers a day doesn't make me feel as if I've enough milk. My self-worth is tied to the amount I pump at night, whether or not he fed from both breasts and if he sleeps 3 hours at a time. Breastfeeding is hard. Harder than anything I've ever done. But just like everything else which is learnt, it gets easier once it works. As my gyne told me, delegate. You need to keep your sanity. If he won't latch, pump and let someone else feed him. You have a million feeds to go, dropping a few feeds a day won't mean you can't bond with your child.   Katrina       April 23, 2012 10:37 p.m.   I had heard breastfeeding was challenging but if you could just get through the first couple of weeks all would be fine. It didn't exactly happen that way for me. I experienced Mastitis along with the joy of breastfeeding. Talk about painful. I had no clue I had Mastitis and thought red spider veins, ultra tenderness &amp; cracking nipples was part of the deal. Wrong. I had Mastitis for almost 6 weeks. I battled through the pain because I knew it would all be worth it. My baby girl is 16 weeks &amp; has the cutest chubby little legs. She is one healthy baby. My piece of advice would be: mentally battle through the pain, surround yourself with supportive family/friends &amp; imagine the happiness you will experience once your baby is able to latch on by his/herself &amp; looks up to smile at you during a feeding. It's the best feeling &amp; makes me tear up thinking of her little smile. Priceless. Best of luck to all!   Lori       April 21, 2012 11:54 p.m.   I have a 2 day old baby boy and he loves to cluster feed. The cluster feedings will last for hours. He always wants something in his mouth. Should I just give in and give him a pacifier when he gets this way?    Daisy       March 14, 2012 7:57 p.m.   It's funny how I can relate to this post.,I never knew that breastfeeding is hard..I am a first time mom of a 10 days old baby.I really wanted to breastfeed my baby 'coz I know it is the best for my baby.Few days ago,whenevee my baby latch on me I'd be close to crying because it hurts so much and now I'm still waiting for my nipple to get used to him sucking. As of now,since,I can't tolerate the pain.I don't know if it's okay to pump my breast than physically letting him to suck my breast.   Mary       March 3, 2012 10:16 a.m.   Breastfeeding has been the most challenging aspect of new motherhood for me, by far.  I had decided that we would be breastfeeding for a year - took the classes, read up, bought a pump for when I have to return to work.  I never counted on my daughter not latching.  I worked with the lactation consultant several times a day at the hospital, but had to start giving her formula because of jaundice.  I pumped and gave her colostrum by syringe.  When we got home, I pumped every time she took a bottle, and I was able to eventually produce enough to eliminate the formula.  All I did was pump, feed and wash bottles - and cry.  Then I got a clogged duct and mastitis, and it was back to supplementing formula.  I figured if I have to use formula anyway, I'm cutting back on the pumping.  She'd get what I could manage, but I didn't want to waste my maternity leave bonding with a breast pump.  Giving up is the best thing I did.  Eventually I was able to pump enough in fewer sessions to feed all breast milk.  I was just trying to get to 2 months b/f switching to formula.  At 6 weeks, my daughter started screaming while I was pumping so I made a last ditch effort to get her on the breast and it worked!  It's only been 2 days bottle-free, and I no longer pretend to know how we'll handle tomorrow.  All you need to know is that one way or another, you will make sure you baby gets fed and do what works best for your family.   That's all that matters.   Tisha       February 6, 2012 2:03 p.m.   I had a similar experience with my oldest more than 12 years ago. Breastfeeding was simply horrid. We tried all the usual tips, but I was frustrated and in constant pain every feeding -- and my baby was probably no better off. At about 4 weeks, her doctor finally told me to let it go. I wasn't doing either of us any good by being so stressed and frustrated. Once I had the doctor's &quot;permission&quot; to do what worked for us, I felt so much better and actually started to enjoy my baby. I think my state of mind was way more important for my baby's health than my ability to breastfeed. I'm glad for women who are able to breastfeed or even like it (!) but I've never regretted my own decision to stop.   Maddie       February 1, 2012 9:49 p.m.   My daughter is 3 weeks old and I was set on exclusively breastfeeding her. Once I had her however and we tried she would not latch on for anything. She would suckle for a few seconds and them scream bloody murder everytime. The lactation consultant at the hospital tried multiple things including a nipple shield ( because mine were not really sticking out) to putting a little formula on my nipple to trick the baby. We tried for 2 weeks to get her to nurse at every feeding for the first 15 minutes like we were recommended to do. We could never get her to latch on. I no longer attempt to breastfeed her so I have to pump and supplement with formula because I don't produce enough for her. She was born 10lb 9 oz and needs to eat more than the average sized baby. In the end I'm disappointed that I can't breastfeed my baby but my pediatrician told me that some babies just will not take a breast, especially is they don't want to work for the food like my daughter. But the 2 weeks I tried were very difficult emotionally because I felt like such a failure that I couldn't do the most basic thing: feed my baby. If this happens to you and you have a baby that just won't latch just know that it's not your fault. Some babies just will not take a breast.    Sarah       January 28, 2012 1:53 p.m.   Wonderful article. It's been great to read everyone's experiences. I am lucky that my son and I fell into a groove early on with breastfeeding and he's been exclusively breastfed for almost five months now. I do remember the beginning being very hard but definitely worth the bonding we've had together. Here's some advice that helped me throughout: 1) If the latch is proper, breastfeeding should not hurt. For me, it was a little painful as he latched (only in the beginning weeks) but then the pain went away. If I was in pain while he was nursing, it usually meant that I needed to readjust his latch. 2) Cracked and sore nipples are a reality of breastfeeding but go away after a few weeks. The nurses at the hospital recommended a saline rinse to cleanse/soothe followed by lanolin and cups allowing them to air dry. Worked wonders! 3) If breastfeeding doesn't work out, many babies are perfectly healthy and happy with breastmilk from a bottle and/or formula. Having a backup container of formula in the pantry helped ease my stress and ultimately helped us to be successful. 4) Find a support system of other moms who can answer your questions when you have them. Good luck ladies!   Ally       August 12, 2011 10:23 a.m.   I find there is a lot of pressure on new mums to breast feed, regardless of how painful or harmful it is for mom and baby. I had mastitis and would rather go through birth again than to breast feed ever again. In the end, I pumped, used bottles, and formula to supplement, and my baby boy is happy and healthy. The whole process was certainly more hygienic than using cracked, bleeding and infected nipples!! But I was angry at the amount of pressure I faced from health officials to breastfeed. I ended up on antibiotics and the baby had to be formula fed for a few weeks anyway. Instead of focusing on whether you breastfeed or not, why not focus on whether your baby is getting the right kind of nutrients in the most comfortable way? What's wrong with pumping and bonding with your baby that way? It seems to me that the issue is formula vs. breastmilk vs. combo, not bottles vs. breastfeeding. Regarding the breastmilk issue, experience from my friends also indicates that not everyone has got good quality breastmilk with all the needed nutrients - it's good to get analysis done. Some moms should supplement with formula whether they like it or not - it's the health of the child that matters, not any outdated preconception of what bonding with your baby should look like to everyone else.    Eva       August 1, 2011 7:53 p.m.   I watched my daughter try to breast feed her firstborn(my 1st grandchild)for 5 days,and be devastated that the &quot;latch&quot; she thot was good, was not. Therefore provoking a doubt of her own observations.  The baby screamed hysterically 4nites and could NOT be comforted; she slept from crying exhaustion. I was there to do all housework while they tried to get baby to nurse. There was a discharge lactatn conslt as well as an appt after 2 days home.  That 2nd appt figured out my daughter did not have a good &quot;latch&quot;(when prev she thot she did)and the babys seeming daytime behavior was merely putting up with unsatisfactory feedings.  At nite the reality set in, hence the nite-time screaming from hunger.  Lacation specialists who are not available 24/7 are NOT available.  No one should have to listen to their baby be hungry.   Marge       November 24, 2010 8:52 p.m.   I just had my third baby, and am suffering with the pain of the first week of breastfeeding. Again. I just want to reassure women that it does get better. It usually takes me about two weeks for my nipples to 'toughen up'. Those couple of weeks are brutal, and I end up with a backache from tensing up every time the baby latches on. But it is worth it. The pain will go away. The bonding with baby is priceless.   Marlene       November 5, 2010 9:48 a.m.   Koraline, there is no way to know if the pain would have gone away or not.  For some women it can take up to 6 weeks before it gets comfortable.  You should be proud that you continue to give the baby pumped breast milk.  You are working hard to give your baby what she needs.     mary @ Mayo       October 26, 2010 10:50 p.m.   It's nice to know that it's not a breeze for anyone.  I breastfeed for 2 weeks then bought a pump because it hurt too much.  My baby had a hard time staying latched and I couldn't keep her awake to get a full feeding.  Unfournately, I do not nurse anymore, but I do pump everytime she feeds.  Sometimes I do have to use formula when my milk is low.   Q:  Could anyone tell me if the pain would have subsideded if I continued to nurse? And at about how many weeks does it feel bareable?   Koraline       October 10, 2010 2:34 p.m.   It's really amazing to find out that so many women struggle with breastfeeding. When we're going through it I think we all feel very alone, and as if there's something wrong with us because we can't do something as 'natural' as breastfeeding. I found another account of a lady's first 6 weeks of breastfeeding which I found very comforting in the early stages. http://www.pregnancyweekbyweek.us/stages-of-pregnancy/breastfeeding-part-1 I think it's so important that new mom's know they're not alone and that they have someone to ask for help.     Caroline       August 29, 2010 6:07 a.m.   Thank you for the article. It really is very tough. I thought it would be natural but BF'ing takes a lot of patience and persistence when you have sore/cracked/bleeding nipples like I do. I have been supplementing with formula and pumping as I am in too much pain. Its been 2 weeks now but am hoping it will get better.   gfromatl       August 1, 2010 2:24 p.m.   My baby is 10 weeks old now and started to cry each time after only 4-5 minutes of sucking. He seems to get only 60-80 ml of milk during those 5 minutes. Any obvious best practices to apply to improve this? There is plenty of milk, and he used to eat over 100ml at once few weeks ago... Also, he is extremely active, so 60 ml look terrible not enough. Thanks!   Anca       April 14, 2010 10:41 p.m.   I agree with this article completely! Nobody told me it was difficult to breastfeed. During the first two weeks, both my nipples bled and my baby was shouting because she can't get milk. I was in so much pain that time. I rushed to a lactation consultant who gave me tips on proper breasfeeding. However since my breasts were too painful and I was not producing enough milk, I had to give my baby formula. Anyway, I pumped every two hours for two weeks so I can have &quot;relactation.&quot; Eventually my milk supply increased. Now I have a good supply of milk.  Breastfeeding is a challenge and a commitment. I'm so proud of myself and the other moms who breastfeed their babies!   bella       March 22, 2010 1:42 p.m.   I think that we need all the help we can get when we first start nursing.  Lactation Consultants and the La Leche League are good resources.  Don't forget your friends and family who have successfully breastfed.  They may have good insights also, as well as empathy.   Mary@Mayo       February 11, 2010 11:09 a.m.   I had a very difficult time at first breastfeeding my son. I am a nurse - and knew it would be difficult, but had no idea!!  In the end, it was worth all the tears and frustration.  My son is now 9 months old and I wouldn't have it any other way.  My experience with lactation consultants was amazing - I recommend them to every expectant mom that I know!  They were so supportive and creative in ways to help me out.  I don't know if I could have made it without them.  :)   Kristin        January 12, 2010 3:02 p.m.   There was no one to help me when my first child was born.  but, I breastfed all 5 of my children and would definitely to it all over again.  yes, I had sore nipples but worked through it.  I loved the time spent breastfeeding - just me and my baby.    Ann       January 1, 2010 2:02 a.m.   Thank you, Mary, for this article! I too believed that it was all just supposed to happen naturally, when it really took us six weeks to get it down. My nipples were so raw, I had to pump, which stressed me out so much I wasn't making any milk! Anyway, it took the help of a lactation consultant to calm me down and let me know that what I was experiencing was normal. I'm so glad I stuck with it because it was a great experience in the end, all 14 months! I also found La Leche League to be helpful in support of my experiences, but the real learning came between me and my son.    Sydney       December 23, 2009 2:36 p.m.   La Leche League is a wonderful resource/support for new moms. Try to go to a meeting before your baby is born, meet other women and develop a support system. The book, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, is a good resource.  Breastfeeding is a learned &quot;art&quot;, but, oh so rewarding, for baby and for mom.  Ask for help and support, then follow your gut and your baby's lead.   Melinda       December 23, 2009 10:46 a.m.   I had breastfeeding knowledge and a certificate as a breastfeeding educator before having my first baby. Inspite of this I had a hard time breastfeeding my li'l one, he refused to latch, lactation consultants tried to help me but couldn't get him to latch. My newborn went without feeding for 6 hrs.As a last resort I pumped and supplemented with formula. I was told that I was one of the few women who have very low milk supply. My breastfeeding experience was horrifying as it included problems ranging from sore nipples to mastitis and ofcourse poor milk supply.   Blueberry       December 20, 2009 1:20 p.m.   Sal's advice is good. Despite my hospital's loud trumpeting of its UNICEF &quot;baby-friendly&quot; designation, I had to wait 2 weeks to see a lactation consultant.  You can't wait 2 weeks to make sure your baby's getting enough food, so the options really are to hire someone yourself or start supplementing with formula.   Lisa       December 19, 2009 5:21 p.m.   The lactation consultants in our hospital were overworked and often unavailable.  Best to pay a midwife or doula to come to the hospital after you have delivered your baby to help you get through the early weeks.  In the long run it will still be cheaper than buying formula.    It wo   Sal       December 19, 2009 10:43 a.m.   kim~~Why would using bottles be a bad thing? I breastfed my baby but was unable to do so without bottles.    Chrissy       December 17, 2009 3:42 p.m.   I agree...nobody prepares you for breastfeeding!  It took me 6-8 weeks to get in the groove.  It was so painful but I was determined to not use bottles!  Don't forget it is a learning experience for mom and baby to figure out what they are doing!   kim                 Eating the placenta: A good idea? Breast milk sharing: How does it work?

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   February 9, 2016         Lead poisoning is in the news, but it's hardly new. Symptoms of lead poisoning were apparent in ancient Rome and included personality changes, sterility, stillbirth, mental incompetence and death. Lead was used to season food and preserve wine. It was found in pewter cups, plates, pots and pans. Ancient Rome had lead water pipes. Interestingly, even today lead poisoning is sometimes called ""plumbism.""   Because of the tragedy of lead-polluted water in Flint, Michigan, I got curious about lead in my tap water and other potential sources of lead in my home.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the only way to know if tap water contains lead is to test it. You can also check with your water provider to see if the service pipe at the street (header pipe) has lead. If the service pipe does not have lead, then the plumbing (fixtures, pipes, faucets) in your home is the likely source.   In 1978, the federal government banned lead-containing paint. However, it is estimated that 24 million homes in the U.S. contain deteriorating lead-based paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust. Furthermore, soil around older homes painted with lead-based paint can be contaminated when the paint flakes and peels.   Children and adults can ingest lead through contact with contaminated paint, dust and soil. The CDC recommends having your home inspected by a licensed lead inspector. Your local health department can provide more information on this. If your home has lead, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that you hire a lead-safe renovator  someone who knows how to minimize creation of lead-containing hazardous dust.   Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to the effects of lead exposure. Lead exposure puts pregnant women at risk for miscarriage, premature birth, smaller babies, and damage to the baby's brain, kidneys and nervous system. Infants and children under age 6 are growing quickly and their bodies absorb more lead than adults, and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to lead damage. They are at risk for slow growth and development, damage to hearing and speech, attention deficits and lower academic achievement   Prompted by my research, I called my local water department. They were able to tell me that my service pipe does not have lead. I am still going to get my tap water tested. I accessed the EPA website and found a resource to come do a risk assessment that includes looking for lead in paint, dust and soil.   I'll let you know what I find out.       With      Jennifer K.

I have consumed Ayurvedic medicine for just 6 months, where in the mixture had lead in it as high as 21kppm. After 6 months I experienced energy drain, muscle , abdomen pains very severely.  When I went to have Lead test with my primary care i was diagnosed with 120BLL in 2014. Its been 2 years from then where my BLL now fluctuating between teen's and twenties.   Doctors have hard time suggesting natural methods to get the lead out.Chelation can be done only till certain point after that it depends on our metabolism to reduce or stabilize it. I am yet find a good approach to remove lead naturally from the body.  However if any one has any suggestions I would greatly help.  If you are introducing any new stuff to your body always be doubly sure of the side effects.   Neha       September 21, 2016 12:48 p.m.   I have a question more than a comment.  Can you direct me to how to address lead exposure I had as a child in the 1970s?  I grew up from age 4-15 (1972-1983) in the East Chicago, Indiana West Calumet Housing Project which recently was found to have lead counts as high as 91,000 ppm.  I assume I was exposed to the lead, as it was present from before the building of the housing project.  I am 49 years old now.  Should I get tested or is it too late to show that it was ever in my system?   I could really use help with this.

Here's a link for details: http://www.epa.gov/dwlabcert/contact-information-certification-programs-and-certified-laboratories-drinking-water#state-labs  Also here's a link for phone numbers for state-certified labs that test water for lead: http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/disease/lead.html   Mayo Clinic staff       February 16, 2016 10:24 a.m.   What about well testing.  There are a lot of wells  in our community.   R. Hudson       February 15, 2016 9:01 p.m.   Have also read that our dishes can contain lead and can be tested.

I had been having a myriad of symptoms including joint and muscle pain, rapid acceleration of osteo-arthritus, seizures, headaches, miscarraiges, etc. After the diagnosis my physician put me on chelation therapy with twice daily capsules of to clear my system. After about two months, the bone-deep exhaustion and pain that I have dealt with for years started going away and little by little some of my other symptoms decreased. Unfortunately the length of time that I had elevated lead amounts in my system has done some irreversible bone damage and I now have bone-on-bone arthritis in must weight bearing joints.  When searching for the likely culprit for my exposure, we have pretty much narrowed it down to  lead paint that I was exposed to while I worked doing some home remodeling over 30 years ago. Fortunately my daughter (17) tested ok but my older child (mid 20) has some exposure also.  I learned the hard way that while older houses have a lot of charm and personality, they also have a lot of invisible health risks.

May 5, 2016         For women who are planning and hoping to become pregnant, success may involve more than just timing.   Certain lifestyle factors prior to conception and early in pregnancy may improve the odds of a healthy pregnancy. And it may not be only a woman's lifestyle choices that play a role.   A recent study followed 344 couples who became pregnant. The couples enrolled in the study prior to conception and recorded their lifestyle behaviors throughout the pregnancy. Both men and women were given diaries to record daily lifestyle habits, such as caffeinated and alcoholic beverage intake. Women also noted whether they took over-the-counter or prenatal vitamins.   Of these couples, 28 percent experienced a miscarriage. While the study was not designed to prove cause and effect, miscarriage appeared to be associated with a woman's age. Women age 35 or older had nearly twice the miscarriage risk of younger women.   In addition, there were interesting findings related to multivitamins and caffeine:     Women who routinely took multivitamin-mineral supplements before conception and during early pregnancy had a much lower risk of miscarriage.   Among women, drinking more than two caffeinated beverages a day during the weeks before conception and the first several weeks of pregnancy appeared to be associated with a higher risk of miscarriage.   Men's preconception caffeine consumption also appeared to impact pregnancy. Drinking more than two caffeinated beverages a day during the weeks before conception appeared to be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss.     It's not always clear why miscarriage happens. Because miscarriage is common, it's difficult to determine whether there is a relationship between caffeine and miscarriage.    Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking did not appear to be associated with miscarriage in this study, but other studies do link alcohol and smoking to pregnancy loss. Women trying to become pregnant should still follow current recommendations not to smoke or drink alcohol. Their partners also should not smoke or drink excessive amounts of alcohol, which can cause infertility.   If you're planning to become pregnant, why not view it as an opportunity to make a few positive lifestyle changes?   You and your partner can support each other in adopting healthy habits. And you'll have a head start on being good role models for your kids.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   December 3, 2013         The holiday season is a time when we're often called on to make and take food to a variety of events. Now's the perfect time to brush up on food safety tips to ensure that your celebrations don't go awry.   The first thing to keep in mind is that some people are at greater risk of serious illness or even death from foodborne illness. Those at higher risk are infants, young children, pregnant women and their unborn babies, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, such as those who've had a transplant or who have HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes or kidney disease.   Here some tips to keep your feasts safe:      Clean. Use hot soapy water to wash your hands, utensils, and work surfaces (including cutting boards). Repeat this throughout your preparation to ensure you aren't spreading bacteria around.    Separate. Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods (cooked or raw). Use separate cutting boards or platters for meats, fruits and vegetables, and other foods.   Cook. Use a food thermometer. Cook turkey and other poultry to an internal temperature of 165 F (145 F for other roasts, steaks, or chops). Take the temperature at the innermost part of the bird's thigh and wing  and the thickest part of the breast. Stuffing should also be 165 F. Boil gravies, sauces and soups.   Keep it hot or cold. If serving buffet style, maintain safe temperatures. Keep hot foods hot (140 F or warmer) by using chafing dishes, slow cookers and warming trays. Keep cold foods cold (40 F or cooler) by nesting in bowls of ice.      Here are some safety tips if you're going to be transporting food:     Cook food completely, to its safe cooking temperature. Don't transport partially cooked foods.   Minimize temperature fluctuations. Remove food from the stove/oven just before leaving home. Carefully transfer food to a thermal container or slow cooker, wrap in heavy towels for extra insulation and place in a thermal tote or insulated bag. Use a cooler and/or ice to transport cold foods.   When you arrive, reheat hot foods to 165 degrees or boiling for liquids. Before serving, bring food up to the safe temperature (165 F). Get cold foods in to the refrigerator until ready for serve.     And finally, here's how to safely handle leftovers:     Refrigerate all leftovers in shallow containers within 2 hours of serving (1 hour if the air temperature is above 90 F).    Properly stored leftovers can be kept for 3 to 4 days. But if in doubt, throw them out. Be sure to reheat leftovers to 165 F before serving.   Consider leaving leftovers with the host. By the time you reach home, the food likely will be the in the danger zone  between 40 F and 140 F  when bacteria can quickly multiple.     How do you ensure food safety at home or when sharing a meal with family and friends?   Wishing you enjoyable and safe holiday meals,   Jennifer and Katherine       With      Jennifer K.

It works by allowing normal growth and development of the skin. Acitretin will continue to work after you stop taking it, but after a time, the skin condition returns and you may need to take it again.    Acitretin must not be used to treat women who are able to bear children unless other forms of treatment have been tried first and have failed. Acitretin must not be taken during pregnancy because it causes birth defects in humans. If you are able to bear children, it is very important that you read, understand, and follow the pregnancy warnings for acitretin.

So what are PCBs and what risk do they pose?   Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial chemicals that were manufactured from 1929 until 1979 when they were banned. PCBs have been shown to cause adverse health effects, including potential cancers, and negative effects on the immune, nervous and endocrine systems.   PCB remnants still cycle between air, water and soil, and traces are found all over the world. PCBs settle into water and sediment, where they are taken up by small organisms, fish and animals (including humans) that eat fish. PCBs accumulate in fat and in organs such as liver.   PCBs can pose serious health risks to people who frequently eat contaminated fish. PCBs can be transferred from a mother to her unborn baby, increasing the risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. PCBs may also be transferred from mother to baby through breast milk, and exposure has been associated with learning defects.   Fish are the major dietary sources of PCBs, especially fish caught in contaminated lakes or rivers. However, small amounts are also found in meat, dairy products and drinking water.   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets PCB residue limits for foods, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits for lakes, streams and drinking water. In 2004 these agencies came out with guidelines for fish consumption during pregnancy but PCBs weren't mentioned. Nor were they mentioned in last year's draft update of the guidelines. The final guidelines are expected to be released later this year.   However, two other groups, Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP), released fish consumption guidelines that do address PCBs.   The PSR/ARHP guidelines specifically mention the need for caution with fish, such as salmon, that can contain high levels of PCBs. With respect to salmon, the guidelines say:     Canned Pacific salmon can be eaten twice a week   Fresh or frozen wild Pacific salmon can be eaten up to twice a month   Fresh or frozen farmed Atlantic salmon can be eaten once every 2 months     The guidelines also recommend ways to reduce PCB risks in the preparation of salmon and other fatty fish:     Trim fatty areas (belly, top back and dark meat along the side)   Remove or puncture skin before cooking to allow fat to drain off   Broil, grill, roast or steam fish on a rack to allow fat to drain off    Do not fry large fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish      Both sets of guidelines agree that:     The benefits of eating fish outweigh the risks.   Eating a variety of fish is a good way to minimize risks from contaminants.   Because of high levels mercury (another common pollutant), king mackerel, shark, swordfish and tilefish should be avoided.     The bottom line: Eat a variety of fish twice a week and keep the portion size at 6 ounces (170 grams). When you eat fatty fish like salmon, make sure they're prepared using the above guidelines. When you catch your own fish, follow local and state fish advisories for restrictions.       With      Jennifer K.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   January 5, 2016         Longer winter evenings lend themselves to a bit more time at the dinner table. I have fond memories of family dinners when we went around the table with everyone sharing jokes and trivia  and even an occasional confessionary tale.   Here are a few food-related trivia questions that have come up over the years at my family's table:     What's the difference between shrimp and prawn?  Prawns are larger in size and have larger legs with claws on three pairs. Shrimp are smaller and have shorter legs with claws only on two pairs. However, the terms are often used interchangeably, with regional variations. For example, the term ""shrimp"" is used mostly in the U.S., whereas the term ""prawn"" is more common in Europe. In the U.S., the term ""prawn"" may carry the meaning that the shrimp is actually larger in size.   Is it safer to eat raw oysters in months that contain the letter ""r""?  No. At any time of year, raw oysters may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus  which can be life-threatening, even fatal when eaten by people with liver disease or diabetes, pregnant women or individuals with weakened immune systems. While V. vulnificus are found in higher numbers in oysters during warm months, 40 percent of cases of food poisoning from this bacteria occur during colder months (September through April).   What makes chili peppers hot?  The compound responsible for the heat in chili peppers is capsaicin. It's found mainly in the seeds and inner ribs of the pepper, so take care when cutting up peppers. Capsaicin binds to pain receptors in the mouth and skin. Contrary to common belief, water won't put out the burn. Capsaicin is not water-soluble. Instead, reach for oil or detergent to scrub your hands  the oil or detergent will dissolve and wash away the capsaicin. To cool your mouth, drink a glass of milk. The casein proteins in milk act in a similar way and will ease the pain.   Can you cook without heat?  Yes. Tender protein foods such as fish or shellfish may be cooked by soaking in acidic juice or vinegar. This method of chemically cooking the fish tenderizes the protein like heat does. It's thought that this method of cooking originated in ancient Peru, where the fish dish called ceviche is a classic. Be aware, however, that this method does not ensure that harmful bacteria and parasites that can cause food poisoning are destroyed.     Share a few of your food musings. I'm always on the lookout for new ones.   Jennifer       With      Jennifer K.

What we do at our dinner table is make jokes and do funny things just to make each other laugh and have good time! Occasionally we will have a conversation about things that are going on in the world like political news etc. Mostly we just make jokes about things we've seen the past week or show someone a video of a cat falling into a box! Even though we do like to have fun at the table we always say our grace before we eat at the table! Thats should mostly cover all of the ""traditions"" we usually partake in at the dinner table!

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Folic acid (vitamin B 9) is necessary for strong blood.   Lack of folic acid may lead to anemia (weak blood). Your health care professional may treat this by prescribing folic acid for you.   Some conditions may increase your need for folic acid. These include:      Alcoholism     Anemia, hemolytic     Diarrhea (continuing)     Fever (prolonged)     Hemodialysis     Illness (prolonged)     Intestinal diseases     Liver disease     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach      In addition, infants smaller than normal, breast-fed infants, or those receiving unfortified formulas (such as evaporated milk or goat's milk) may need additional folic acid.   Increased need for folic acid should be determined by your health care professional.   Some studies have found that folic acid taken by women before they become pregnant and during early pregnancy may reduce the chances of certain birth defects (neural tube defects).   Claims that folic acid and other B vitamins are effective for preventing mental problems have not been proven. Many of these treatments involve large and expensive amounts of vitamins.   Injectable folic acid is given by or under the direction of your health care professional. Another form of folic acid is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Folic acid is found in various foods, including vegetables, especially green vegetables; potatoes; cereal and cereal products; fruits; and organ meats (for example, liver or kidney). It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins. For example, heat may reduce the amount of folic acid in foods.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of folic acid needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes in micrograms (mcg) for folic acid are generally defined as follows:   Information about this folic-acid-oral-route-injection-route   Persons   U.S.  (mcg)   Canada  (mcg)     Infants and children   Birth to 3 years of age   25100   5080      4 to 6 years of age   75400   90     7 to 10 years of age   100400   125180     Adolescent and adult males   150400   150220      Adolescent and adult females   150400   145190     Pregnant females   400800   445475     Breast-feeding females   260800   245275     This product is available in the following dosage forms:     Tablet   Injectable   Solution   Capsule       Before Using   Portions of this document last updated:  March 01, 2017   Copyright  2017 Truven Health Analytics Inc.

By  Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   March 6, 2008          Do you take a multivitamin? Or a single vitamin, mineral, or combination supplement? If so, you are in the company of tens of millions of U.S. adults.      Why do you take them? Most people say it makes them feel healthier or they believe it will prevent chronic diseases, or colds and flu. But you may be surprised to know that what is in your bottle and on the label is not strictly regulated. And there is no system in place to collect reports of adverse affects.      Over the past few years there has been increasing evidence that multivitamins and single or combination type vitamin/mineral supplements may not provide the health benefit sought by you, the consumer. In some cases the opposite or no beneficial effects have been reported.      Alarming to think that vitamin or mineral supplements could actually cause more harm than good. An example of this is the use of beta carotene by smokers actually increased the incidence of lung cancer. This is echoed by a recent study out of the University of Washington that reports the use of multivitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E and folate did not reduce the risk of lung cancer.      It is not all bad news though; there are studies to support the use of folate (folic acid) prior to and during pregnancy in the prevention of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. And history has proven that vitamins and minerals play a critical role in our health  the reason we know about the benefits of vitamins and minerals in food is because of the major discoveries in disease prevention such as vitamin C and scurvy and thiamine, a B vitamin, and beri beri (a wasting type disease).      This may leave you wondering if those vitamin mineral supplements in your medicine cabinet are doing what they should or even worth your money.      Let's look at this way  do you eat a well balanced diet? If so, you may not need a multivitamin and if you take one as a ""safety net"" know that you may exceed what your body needs or can use.      Are you concerned about a chronic disease? If so, making changes in your diet and exercise habits, not smoking and following through with recommended screenings by your physician are more likely to benefit your overall health picture.      Consider your current state of health, talk to your doctor and/or dietitian, and weigh the possible benefits and risks of a multivitamin and mineral supplement for you.

Charles Kendall       July 7, 2016 4:33 p.m.   The Cochran report shows that taking vitamin supplements has no benefit at all. Some, under certain circumstances, may, as you note above, cause harm.   Morton Bodanis       January 30, 2016 8:38 p.m.   I'm on 1200 calorie diet and no way possible to consume 3600mg of potassium per day, I'm lucky if I hit half that level. So what does one do. I'm 68 yrs. old current weight 308 lbs. down from 405 just a little over a year ago. Potassium level is my major health concern.   Pasquinel Cobra       April 4, 2015 9:07 p.m.   Dr. told me to start taking a womens 50 plus 1 A Day Multi Vitamin.  Well I went to Wallmart to get that specific 1  Of course the cheapest (same). Then like after about 2 weeks, I Gained weight!! It definitely was the vitamin cuzz I did'nt do any thing different. So I was Pissed & FTS and Stopped. Then I started losing my weight, not right away thou go's on quick harder to take off.  But there must be one that does'nt cause weight gain. I really think I should take 1 w/no weight gain.  Thats my opinion thou. Would love to hear your comments women over ""50"" (I'm ""54"") can't wait!!   Layla       April 4, 2015 8:33 p.m.   Then Why Are You Suppose To Take All Kinds Of vitamins & supplements when you have Gastric Bye Pass Surgery??  Especially strong Biotin because you lose tons of Hair (Dr. said it will decrease it and help it grow back faster??).   Layla       February 27, 2015 11:37 a.m.   After you start vitamins, how long does it take them to absorb into your blood and start working (i.e., 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month)   Andrea       November 28, 2014 1:35 p.m.   I just was told by my doctor (very well respected) that taking multi-vitamin supplement may actually increase your risk for cancer.  This is what many of the studies are showing. True or false?

It is the first important point of the healthcare management process impacting the entire range of behavior including providing accurate and reliable data for optimized patient mind and streamlining an effective reimbursement process.   hospitalkhoj       February 26, 2014 1:57 a.m.   These doctors need to stop lying about taking vitamins cuz they do help...cuz the hospitals & doctors make more money off of people going to the doctor and they prescribe these medications to people that don't really help cuz of the side effects causes more problems   Kenny CleckLey       February 20, 2014 4:57 p.m.   I was shocked when I read the microscopicly lettered ingredients in my bottle of Centrum Silver.  The vitamins which are promoted  for good health contsin...hydogenated palm oil.... There has been so much information about hydrogenated oils and that they are not good for you. And here it is...in a daily vitamin!!  Since most processed food have removed it from their products, here it is in vitamins !  Not many people read the tiny print , especially seniors whose eyesight may not be good. I know it couldnt be much in one vitamin, but it should not be there at all. Just thought I would comment on this becaue I woulkd lke more people to know about this.  thank you,  Catherine Chase  Love your web site,,very helpful!   Catherine Chase       February 1, 2014 11:05 p.m.   There are many differences between brands of vitamins, such as they way they are processed and grown. Yes, vitamins can be pricey and ineffective. It all depends on how your body processes vitamins and minerals. Everyone's body is different, same with their lifestyles. So to say that multivitamins/vitamins on their own are ineffective is very vague. I have been taking Nutrilite Double X for about 10 days now and am feeling great. I had a very poor immune system due to antibiotics and other illnesses.   Mike       January 4, 2014 1:44 a.m.   I stopped taking multivitaments for 6 weeks now, but i feel not the same, tired and no appetied   Annet van Dorsser       October 2, 2013 11:12 a.m.   Can some smart person like Matt --with whom I concur on the use of vitamins-- tell me  -can a preschooler get a sore tongue and fungus-like conditions from eating tooo much fruit?  This is a serious query.  I await a response.  Jody   Jody       July 11, 2013 3:35 p.m.   Besides the fact that vitamin supplements are not regulated, then add the fact that synthetic vitamin supplements have NEVER been proven to be effective by anyone or too anyone(you'd think that if they were effective a lab could prove it in this day and age)I will bow out and use my common sense to just eat a well balanced diet(and use the money I save on all the pills for a nice vacation). I refuse to be &quot;conditioned&quot; by all the hype and marketing $$$ and refuse to follow the &quot;sheep&quot;.  Baaah!     Skeptic       June 24, 2013 2:06 p.m.   This article doesn't really address the complexities surrounding this issue. There are many different vitamins on the market, all of which have varying percentages of the daily recommended values for various vitamins and minerals. Also, the issue of whether or not there is a significant difference between synthetic vitamins and vitamins derived from whole foods is not addressed. The studies mentioned in this article are not very relevant. The fact that smokers developed lung cancer at a slightly higher rate isn't really much of a relevant result for non smokers. Also, the fact that vitamins don't reduce the risk of cancer in one study doesn't really speak to other potential benefits, or risks. I'm going to look for an all natural multivitamin without excessive daily values and I may just take it every other day. I'll keep exercising and I'll try to eat a little bit healthier. Everything in moderation I guess.    Matt       March 6, 2013 8:20 a.m.   A reliable way to gather hysterical nonsense is to consult public opinion on the subject of food.   Herbert       January 15, 2013 10:23 a.m.   Ohhhh, Nooo ! Alert the media ! &quot;In some cases&quot;. &quot;MAY not&quot;. Gasp ! Why isn't the TV news constantly warning us of this horrible threat to our health ? I'm 60, and I've been taking vitamin / mineral supplements, as what you call a safety net, since I was knee high. I admit,I can't run a marathon or lift 300 lbs over my head, but do I need to ? Modern physicians are 99 % pill-pushers for the drug manufacturers. Don't eat &quot;convenience food&quot;, get some exercise, and take a few of those &quot;safety nets&quot;. Thank you. Live long, and prosper.   Tom       January 15, 2013 3:41 a.m.   I am not sure why this article suggests to talk to your doctor or dietitian about the benefits and risks of taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement. Why on earth would I talk to a doctor who has absolutely no education or training in NUTRITION. Doctors are like the general public when it comes to nutrition they watch doctor oz and listen to advertising on television and eat foods full of MSG, aspartame, and genetically modified organisms all lovingly approved by the FDA, the supposed watchdog and gatekeeper of healthy food and drugs. Doctors are not trained in nutrition they are trained to hand out pharmaceutical synthetic drugs. Most doctors think vitamins and minerals are quackery....Well, I've got news for you, it is biochemistry. The body is powered by vitamins and minerals at a cellular level...not by drugs...drugs simply mask symptoms and temporarily give the patient the illusion of health, an illusion that Houdini couldn't even have pulled off...deaths attributed to prescription drugs used as directed conservative estimates are 106,000 per year. Vitamins and minerals don't even average 1 provable death...call the poison control center and get the numbers! This article is a sham. Talk to a biochemist if you want to know how your body works, not a doctor or dietitian. It has been proven that most of the symptoms mainstream medicine categorizes as disease is actually nutritional deficiencies or toxicity. You can't cure a nutritional deficiency with drugs.   Jason       January 3, 2013 10:23 p.m.   How long does the break between vitamin taking have to be? how many times I have to take vitamins in a year?    Alex       November 6, 2012 2:05 p.m.   I'm not sure the purpose of the article as it pertains to the description of Multi-Vitamins effectiveness on preventing disease. There has never been any statement by anyone, anywhere, at any time that taking vitamins can reduce the risk of lung cancer for smokers. It's absolutely absurd to plant the seed of doubt amongst a population that clearly cannot decide for itself how to eat properly (over 30% of Americans are overweight or obese), and tell them it might not be in their best interest to take a multivitamin. Sure, taking copious amounts of fat soluble vitamins and heavy metals are NOT ok, but vitamin C? There's this funny little blurb on the bottom of every vitamin bottle in the US that tells you its not meant to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, the F.D.A. forces them to put it on the bottle. So, to sum up the article, if I smoke, taking a multivitamin won't prevent lung cancer, got it, thanks. Think I'll keep taking my GNC multivitamin, while you check the validity of writing such an article, check back with you in 50 years when there is actual RESEARCH!   Sam       March 13, 2012 10:51 a.m.   Mary: Caffeine is not considered a vitamin, nor a mineral - nor is it considered an essential nutrient. So it doesn't necessarily enhance nutritional status. Caffeine is a stimulant, and evidence of its benefits/risks are conflicting. It is accepted that it increases alertness and may enhance athletic performance (depending on the sport). But in some people and in high enough doses it may have adverse effects (headache, anxiety, sleeplessness) and trigger heart beat irregularities. If you drink caffeinated beverages and take a supplement with caffeine, you may be getting more caffeine than your realize. Thanks for your question.   Jennifer Nelson       March 12, 2012 1:07 p.m.   Is caffeine good in a multivitamin? I was taking a multivitamin by Eniva called VIBE Cardiac &amp; Life, it contains 2.5 cups of caffeine out of 32 oz.  please respond.   Mary       December 31, 2011 7:21 p.m.   Everyone should do a little research on the lack of vitamins and minerals in our food.  Farming practices (certain fertilizers inhibit a plant's ability to absorb minerals from the ground), shipping (most fruits and vegetables ripen when they are not attached to the ground), processing, and packaging all contribute to a great decrease in the amount of vitamins and minerals that actually make it into our bodies.  When you add to this that the standard American diet is FAR from being &quot;well balanced&quot;, (remember, they call it &quot;standard&quot; because that is the way most of us eat), most of us need to get more vitamins and minerals. I have recently started taking a vitamin and mineral supplement and I feel better and have more energy. I will never stop.    Greg       May 5, 2011 6:02 p.m.   Need your help.  Read your comments on multi-vitamins.  Was helpful, but much more helpful if you recommended a handful that met your requirements.  There are so many products out there, that some real guidance would have been more meaningful   Larry       March 16, 2011 1:24 p.m.   I came across this Mayo article in the middle of reading the vitamin and supplements chapter in &quot;Denialism.&quot;  All right, I looked for it because of what I read.  The problem is largely anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot; against facts.  Unfortuantely Mayo gives us few of the latter.  Do read &quot;Denialism&quot; if you care what you put in your body, and for good measure &quot;White Coat, Black Hat&quot; and &quot;Our Daily Meds&quot; for the same reason.  I'm 76, a survivor of prostate and bladder cancers and down to just a multivitamin with full support of my docs.   Next annual appointment I'll ask about dumping the vitamins and enjoying my healthy diet even more.  Eat well, join the Y.       Ron       October 3, 2010 1:52 p.m.   This article makes no sense.  I'm going to recommend everyone stick with the standard thing: eat a healthy, balanced diet, and get your vitamins that way.  Taking a basic vitamin/general supplement can help supplement anything extra you're missing, but don't use it to try and fix a bad diet.   Matt       September 17, 2010 12:15 p.m.   all this is very confusing for someone who wants to know whether taking food supplements is beneficial or not.  I guess that in the contemporary health care no advice is unanimously agreed upon... and people's comments make it even more confusing!   Toufic       June 13, 2010 2:47 p.m.   I know some people who sell Amway and they take a large amount of supplements (at least 20 different ones) they also propose an energy drink from that business that is loaded with B vitamins they say is needed by an elderly alzheimers relative. the energy drink is also caffeinated and they say the alzheimers patient should drink 4 per day.  It doesn't make sense to me and also I think they are trying to make money off this alzheimers patient.  They also have him taking ginko, Q10, Omega, Perfect Water, and a multi vitamin.  Do you think this 80 year old alzheimers patient needs this, or do you think someone is selling Amway to just make money?   Judy       March 31, 2010 8:57 p.m.    There is a great deal of information out there, it would be nice if we followed a more 'European' model and applauded the help these things (vitamins and herbal supplements) offer many people. Perhaps creating some jobs regulating purity and consistent dosage in the industry, but letting people decide what to put in their own bodies.Check out Pub Med,  medlineplus, and other reputable websites, many libraries have well documented books of drug interactions and herbal preparations and vitamin information.. they can also help direct you to a reputable source for such information.    Medical  educational institutions need to embrace the helpfulness of these items and respect the differences of each persons  body. Partner to help find out what works, don't condemn. There is data out there on how many persons use these things (and swear by them) yet don't tell their doctors due a perceived disrespect for their choices.....better we should all be dedicated to what works  (get a good medical librarian, demand courses at medical schools, make sure you seem open minded to your patients and demand that testing on vitamins and herbal preparations be conducted). I  think the 'horse is already out of the barn'.    Marena       March 31, 2010 8:21 a.m.   What the body does not need can be eliminated.  Trust in the wisdom of the body - flesh is not dumb.  And results have proven that treatment of desease with so-called mega vitamin therapy is an excellent modality.  Now the question is:  When is the Mayo Clinic coming on board an Orthomolecular Chair?   Sally       March 23, 2010 8:58 a.m.   I am a 68 yo female. Eat a healthy diet, exercise and maintain a normal weight. Never smoked, seldom drink. Taken a multi-vitamin daily since a young child. After reading your e-mail I discontinued my multiple vitamin and I have had more energy, slept better and feel wonderful. Also, there has been a royal blue ring in my toilet for months. After discontinuing the multiple vitamin, it has disappeared--pretty expensive urine I think!   Doris       March 19, 2010 2:09 p.m.   I was taking extra vitamin C along with juices that had up to 130% of the daily recommended dosage and my iron levels became worringly high.     Romeo       March 19, 2010 7:01 a.m.   You people, and the medical community in general, are ready to sound alarms, suggest dire possibilities but unwilling (unable) to offer useful directions. How about some firm suggestions supported by data. Surely there have been studies on the efficacy of multivitamins and other supplements. Yes?   Bob       March 18, 2010 12:00 p.m.   I've been taking a multivitamin, 500 mg vitamin &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot; complex vitamins; and calcium with &quot;D&quot; for years.  I was told vitamins &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are stored in your body so be careful not to take more than your body needs daily.  &quot;B&quot; vitamins are water soluble and are eliminated by your body daily.  Vitamin &quot;C&quot; is also water soluble.  Read your labels carefully.  Produce that is shipped:  how many vitamins are left after sitting on trucks and in a wharehouse for days?  By the time it gets to a supermarket the vitamins are gone.  The trick is to buy from your local farm when available.  During the winter months I buy frozen vegetables and feel they are better than so called &quot;fresh.&quot;   Bea       March 17, 2010 7:06 p.m.   I find My HMO Drs never agree that my Conditions (Side effects)  caused by  for  Example 40mg Omeprazole Caused Rapid Heart Beat after about being on them for 2 months had to be admitted to ER and ICU to bring pulse  back to Normal.Later I read the Lit given to me when I got the Med and there it was--Rapid Heart Beat as psbl Side Effect I called my Dr and he did not agree w/me that that was the Cause.About 3 weeks ago started getting severe Stomach Cramps and Vomitting - called Dr said if continues got to Urgent care and take Maalox never mentioned it could be the Omeprazole.I called Pharmacist my Symptoms listed as #1 complaint called my Gastro DR (I have Ulcers)he also did not agree it was the Omeprazole.Im about to give up on asking Drs -  best to call your Pharmacist and t/w your Cab Driver. My Cab Driver told me he has been drinking Aloe Vera Juice for Ulcers and Digestive health for years and no more Stomach Distress.  Went to Wall Mart bought a Gallon of Pure Aloe Vera - no sugar cut down to only 1 cap of Omeprazole and started w/4 oz of the juice in the morning or sip throughout the day as I do not like the taste but guess what it works I feel much better watch what I eat but found I can eat a Hamburger and or a spicy Burritto and no problem - have to be careful though and dont stuff myself.(Been on Aloe Vera Juice about 1 week now) Also found out some Mexican Super Mkts have the Aloe Vera Gel Or plant and you can peel it and Dice and eat like A Salad.   Benny Sr       March 17, 2010 6:50 p.m.   Alarm! Alarm! But no facts or information of substance.   Ron       March 17, 2010 12:27 p.m.   In my 20's I was a skinny malnourished woman working full time but always tired and irritable.  Late 20's started taking multiple vitamins/minerals, gained to normal weight and felt 100% better.  Enabled me to continue working to age 65.  I'm now 74 and still living independently, driving, shopping, etc. and feel and look great!  I highly recommend taking the recommended doses of vitamins for all ages.  (Your body will eliminate anything you ingest not needed.)   Jean       March 17, 2010 8:04 a.m.   I currently take a daily multivitamin, 3 Niacin caps and nine (9) 1000mg Fish oil caps daily as prescribed by my Cardiologist!  My previously elevated LDL cholestorel levels have dropped like a rock and are now normal.  My HDL levels have risen to normal.  After diagnosis of Stage 3 Folicular Lymphoma in 2003 and taking 8 rounds of Chemo (Retuxan Chop), having a heart attack in 2006 and undergoing Angioplasty and Stent implantation I can say without a doubt that taking supplements along with modifying my diet and walking has improved my health 100% and at 47 y/o I have never felt better in my life.  My suggestion is to talk to your Primary Care Physician before starting any aggressive vitamin regimen but don't count out taking supplements as part of your daily overall health improvement plan.  Do everything in moderation including vitamins, diet and exercise.  Moderation and consistency are the keys to success in keeping healthy and staying out of the hospital.  And most importantly staying alive for those we love!   Mark       March 17, 2010 6:53 a.m.   Ooo, you hit a hot button there.  With all the meds that are pushed at us in this country with little or no advice for life style changes, you're telling us to beware of supplements?!!!    Survivor       March 17, 2010 1:53 a.m.   Well,i think multivitamins are helpful they have been here since long.We need to have some kind of moderation as my mother says excess of evrything is bad.   mrinal       March 16, 2010 11:33 p.m.   I've worked in medical research settings for many years and I haven't met any physicians who know much about nutrition--or are at all interested.  As for &quot;well-balanced diets&quot;, this thread-bare phrase should be put to rest.  Supplements: There is so much advertising hype, and the scent of money attracts some professionals who probably know better.  I take supplements and use some alternative medical treatments, but I read as much as I can about what I am doing.  Good luck!  You'll need it.   Norm       March 16, 2010 10:38 p.m.   Beta carotene are bad for smokers? My boyfriend smokes a ton and likes making carrot juice. This is bad?   Alexandra       March 16, 2010 10:10 p.m.   You lost me when your fist argument stated that lack of regulation means we should all be wary of supplements. I am much more wary of the pharmaceuticals that the FDA DOES regulate, which cause more mortality and adverse side effects than any vitamin. What's so outrageous is that this type of rhetoric/scare tactic still persists in the medical community, even though many comments have pointed out the obvious flaw in this rhetoric.    Kathleen       March 16, 2010 6:31 p.m.   Possibly the vitamins and supplements do not do all that we hope for.  But what about prescription drugs which are ?regulated? and the list of warnings given on those regulated drugs?  Frankly, I will continue to use my vitamins and supplements and avoid the prescription regulated ones!!!!!   Florence       March 16, 2010 4:08 p.m.   It seems to me that the 'attacks' against using supplements are based on two main points: 1. That the quality/predictability of the vitamin or mineral may very from manufacturer to manufacturer. To which I say: a. I guess if you buy your vitamins at a 5 &amp; 10 cent store, expect to buy cheap products. Good companies would tend to be more predictable and dependable. b. The foods we buy at the stores would and do suffer from the same lack of dependability, as to freshness, vitality, etc. Which speaks to the sense of trying supplementation. 2. Balanced diet is the answer. What planet is this recommendation for? With greens coming from Mexico and fruits from Argentina and U. S. products heavy with unknown additives -- I mean let's get real. 3. Oh - one other 'attack' is the fear of what nutrients can do when encountering situations in our bodies... e.g. pregnancy, other drug interactions, etc. This is fear-based rhetoric. If taken seriously - -who checks what an Ibuprofen does when entering a body of a pregnant woman also taking pre-natal supplements and high blood pressure Rx? So much rhetoric -- so little real world... Reasonable supplements are health insurance premiums against the risk of life as we know it.    Tom       January 29, 2010 11:55 a.m.   To FRANK H. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU BOUGHT YOUR SUPPLEMENT in Europe.  Anything that dissolves in water will be absorbed so much better than tablets. Please                        ***FRANK H. ***IF YOU ARE HERE, PLEASE HELP ME FIND SOME GOOD SUPPLEMENTS.  Or if anyone else can help me out, I thank you in advance.     Sue       January 28, 2010 2:42 p.m.   I'm 80 yrs old - I do all my own housework, laundray, shopping and still drive.  I never get colds or have I ever had a flu shot!  I take a mulltiple vitamin, extra D3 and B6 plus Omega 3.  Heck!  I'm gonna die anyway!   Pat       December 10, 2009 6:34 p.m.   I have been taking a multivitamin that I purchased from Europe. The multivitamin contains the 12 essential vitamins our body needs at 100% of each of their values. I can honestly tell you that I have never felt better since taking this tablet. It desolves in water and tastes great. Why doesn't this product exist in this county? We don't get enough vitamins our body needs in the processed foods found in the States. My energy and mind are clearer and last the day long. I'm not tired, sore or achy.     Frank H       December 7, 2009 8:38 p.m.   My husband was told by a surgeon that I should loose weight.   That I'm at 25% mortality rate right now.  What does he mean by this.   I am extremely obesed.  My bmi is 87.5     cheyene       September 8, 2009 12:18 a.m.   The study in Nutrition Journal  ( http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/30 ) noted by Toni merely says that people who take vitamins have more vitamins in their bloodstream.  If you read the article, you'll see that the so-called &quot;biomarkers&quot; they found in supplement users' blood are the vitamins themselves.  The article says nothing about &quot;better health&quot; of supplement users, except certain cases of self-assessed health that were not statistically significant. The article comes to no clear or strong conclusion about anything, really. This doesn't mean that supplements are useless, but rather that the long-term data show unclear results.   Howard       February 21, 2009 9:25 p.m.   Since we have a hand-free axes to by any kind of nutrition supplements in a market, chances are that we can harm our self much easier than helping our self. In the old countries, where these opportunities do not exist, people eat less but natural food and live longer, happier and active life. In modernized countries, we look for supplements to move us from couch. If is for me ,brothers and sisters; boil and don't broil- even the oil(don't fry). Never fill your stomack in full. Vitamins in morning- minerals in evening and high protein- the last after meal, followed by cold water drink. No starch, no sugar- if you want to live longer. Today stay away from the food which bothered you yesterday. If your tongue is white in morning - you ate bad food in evening. TO BEFIT DOCTORS AND NUTRITION CORPORATES -JUST IGNORE MY COMMENTS. TO BENEFIT YOUR SELF, LIVE THOSE SULFATES IN THEIR SHELFS. Se you in a great health!   luigi       July 26, 2008 6:13 p.m.   I don't believe in a so called healthy diet,overcooking,processing,pesticdes,the  list goes on,but all add to getting little or no benefits from any vitamin content contained in food,better a multivitamin if in doubt ask at any reputable health shop,most medical professionals frown upon supplements,saying that a balanced diet is better for you,it,s too difficult in this day and age to get this,most  people opt for quick meals,fast foods, which have little or no vitamins in them you could never assess exactly what you get from food properly in any case.   stuart fraser       July 14, 2008 11:33 a.m.   I have an excess of iron and calcium detected from blood tests - what causes this and how is it treated?   Cindy       May 2, 2008 6:13 a.m.   I BELIEVED THAT SOME MULTIVITAMINS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE,BASSED ON YOUR RESEACH, CAN YOU OUTLINE THOSE MULTIVITAMINE THAT ARE EFFECTIVE TO HUMAN HEALTH?.      GERALD       March 30, 2008 8:58 p.m.   Check out the Landmark Study in Nutrition Journal, an online, peer-reviewed international human nutrition journal. The study, entitled Usage Patterns, Health, and Nutritional Status of Long-Term Multiple Dietary Supplement Users, is the first-ever study on long-term users of multiple dietary supplements, and found these users comparatively to have markedly better health as measured by higher blood levels of key nutrients and more optimal levels of key health biomarkers. This simply confirms that long-term consumers of specific whole food supplements have better health than the two comparison groupsthose who used just a multivitamin and those who use no supplements at all.  Publication of the Landmark study in Nutrition Journal ensures free and universal access to the manuscript thus enabling immediate communication of these important Landmark study research findings to and from virtually any place in the world. The study will also be indexed in PubMed Central, a free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature published by the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ensuring broad based availability of the study manuscript.  This publication offers incredible support and enhancement to scientific credibility.  If anyone would like a copy, I would be happy to send one.   To the best of health, Antoinette   Toni       March 26, 2008 3:34 p.m.   I don't know why anyone feels the need to cite the beta carotene study regarding smokers.If a person smokes they shouldn't expect any results from supplements because they shouldn't be smoking and talking about health in the same sentence. Nothing good comes from smoking and the havoc it causes to every system of the body. Beta carotene is not bad but in a smokers body it might be- but that's because they smoke!! Most americans are fat, stressed out and unhealthy and could certainly use a multivitamin not to mention a few other supplements.    Karen       March 26, 2008 8:36 a.m.   Seriously, who wants to take another pill or more? Natural forms of vitamins in minerals found in food work much better with one another than taking isolated forms of vitamins and minerals. For good health we all should be eating balanced meals most of the time. That way we do get the right amount of vitamins and minerals that our bodies need. Of course there are specific cases when people who are truly deficient of a certain vitamin and/or mineral with need to use supplements.

You seem to be a rather unscientific thinker. I for one am glad that people with real expertise on nutrition (dieticians) are willing to put out unbiased, scientifically valid advice like this for us.   As for not promoting &quot;wellness,&quot; do you not think that citing the evidence that supports the potential harm of supplements is done in the name of promoting wellness?   The careful methods of science have done more for human wellness than anything else I can think of.     rob       March 14, 2008 8:28 p.m.   I take Vibe, a liquid supplement, for vitamins and antioxidants, and Efacor for Omega3s every day, and I am sure they do improve my overall health.   Dave       March 12, 2008 10:52 a.m.   I am a 48 year old healthy, normal-weight woman.  My doctor recommends taking a multivitamin plus calcium supplements.  I find taking these pills leaves a lump in my stomach all day.  I do not take vitamins on an empty stomach, but they still bother me.  Any suggestions?  Can I crush the tablets up before taking them?  Can I just drink milk instead of taking the calcium tablets?  How much milk do I need?   Marie       March 11, 2008 8:35 p.m.   You're obviously being paid by the &quot;sickness industry&quot; and not the &quot;wellness industry.&quot; -End of Comment   Tim       March 11, 2008 6:11 p.m.   Perhaps in the medical world the training for supplements is vastly underestimated and therefore you have no formal training in actual supplementation. I happen  to know this for a fact because of my association with medical professionals, although I am not one myself. You would also be surprised to know that there is research from Harvard saying every adult needs to be taking at least a multivitamin. You are correct in saying that what vitamins claim to have in them is not &quot;strictly regulated.&quot;   Katie Carter       March 9, 2008 10:38 a.m.   London is beyond the 51st parallel and nobody who eats a reasonable diet here i short of Vitamin D.  I'm disappointed that the Mayo Clinic, of all places, isn't a bit more forthright in pointing out how much money is wasted on unnecessary supplements.   David Colquhoun       March 8, 2008 6:32 p.m.   I don't know if vitamins work or not.  But I can say that I have taken a mulitvitamine for many years, and am very rairly sick.   joanne       March 7, 2008 7:47 a.m.   You failed to mention Vit. D and the lack thereof especially north of the 40th parallel may be inadequate d/t lack of sun exposure several months of the year, using sun screen, and potentially underestimated RDA.

Thiamine was one of the first compounds recognized as a vitamin.   Thiamine is involved in many body functions, including nervous system and muscle function, the flow of electrolytes in and out of nerve and muscle cells, digestion, and carbohydrate metabolism. Very little thiamine is stored in the body and depletion can occur within 14 days. Severe thiamine deficiency may lead to serious complications involving the nervous system, brain, muscles, heart, and stomach and intestines.   Dietary sources of thiamine include beef, brewer's yeast, legumes (beans, lentils), milk, nuts, oats, oranges, pork, rice, seeds, wheat, whole-grain cereals, and yeast. In industrialized countries, food made with white rice or white flour is often enriched with thiamine.   Thiamine is used as part of a treatment for metabolic disorders and thiamine deficiency symptoms, as well as in alcoholics. It has been studied for other uses, but conclusions are lacking at this time.

By  Mary M. Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   August 27, 2013          If you're expecting, you want to do what's best for your baby. That means following some basic pregnancy rules  and there's no shortage of people and places recommending them. There are umpteen books, magazines, websites and blogs (including mine) full of pregnancy advice. Family, friends and complete strangers also are more than happy to tell you what you should or should not do during your pregnancy.      Why are there so many pregnancy rules? As knowledge about the human body and pregnancy has grown, so have the cautions health care providers recommend during pregnancy. We warn pregnant women about deli meat, hot tubs, caffeine, and alcohol. We encourage exercise, good nutrition and use of folic acid.      Do health care providers know for a fact that caffeine during pregnancy will significantly increase your risk of miscarriage? Do we have absolute proof that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy will harm your child? No, we don't. The ethics of performing research on pregnant women is tricky territory. Our knowledge largely comes from observations about what has happened in the past or animal studies. We look at previous pregnancies and deliveries. We examine children and what happened during their prenatal periods to draw conclusions. As a result, most of our recommendations are based on potential risks to moms and babies.      If a woman asks me if drinking a glass of wine will harm her baby, I have to answer that we don't know for sure. I can explain that the U.S. Surgeon General recommends complete abstinence because a safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption hasn't been determined. Likewise, if a woman asks about caffeine during pregnancy, I can tell her that studies show there is a relationship between high caffeine use and miscarriage  and that it's probably dose related. However, there aren't 'yes' or 'no' answers for most of these types of questions.      I believe we need more pregnancy research. Your body works differently when you're pregnant. Without research, we won't know if a medication or treatment will be as successful during pregnancy as it is otherwise. I also wish there were absolute rules in pregnancy so you could know that if you did everything just the way you were told, your baby would be born healthy. But I don't think we'll ever get to that point.      In the meantime, I believe it's our responsibility as health care providers to inform pregnant women and their partners about the risks, the likelihood of those risks and the leading experts' recommendations. Then, it's your responsibility to ask questions and decide what's best for you and your pregnancy.         With      Mary M.

It is involved in the process of making serotonin and norepinephrine, which are chemicals that transmit signals in the brain. Vitamin B6 is also involved in the formation of myelin, a protein layer that forms around nerve cells.   Vitamin B6 deficiency in adults may cause health problems affecting the nerves, skin, mucous membranes, and circulatory system. In children, the central nervous system is also affected. Deficiency can occur in people with kidney failure complications, alcoholism, liver scarring, overactive thyroid, problems with absorbing nutrients, and heart failure, as well as those taking certain medications. Mild deficiency of vitamin B6 is common.   Major sources of vitamin B6 include cereal grains, legumes, vegetables (carrots, spinach, peas, and potatoes), milk, cheese, eggs, fish, liver, meat, and flour. Vitamin B6 is often used with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulas.   High blood levels of the amino acid homocysteine may be a risk factor for heart disease. Taking vitamin B6 supplements with other B vitamins (folic acid and vitamin B12) has been shown to be effective for lowering homocysteine levels.   Vitamin B6 has been studied for the treatment of many conditions, including anemia (low amounts of healthy red blood cells), vitamin B6 deficiency, certain seizures in newborns, and side effects of the drug cycloserine. Evidence in support of other uses is lacking.     Related terms   Portions of this document last updated:  Nov. 01, 2013         Mayo Clinic no promociona compaas ni productos.

It is also used to control high blood pressure in a mother during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) or in emergency situations when blood pressure is extremely high (hypertensive crisis).    High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.    Hydralazine works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

La enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal incluye principalmente a la colitis ulcerosa y a la enfermedad de Crohn. Ambas suelen presentar diarrea intensa, dolor, cansancio y prdida de peso. La enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal puede ser debilitante y, a veces, puede provocar complicaciones mortales.   La colitis ulcerosa es una enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal que provoca inflamacin y llagas (lceras) duraderas en el recubrimiento ms interno del intestino grueso (colon) y recto.   La enfermedad de Crohn es una enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal que provoca inflamacin en el recubrimiento del tubo digestivo. En la enfermedad de Crohn, la inflamacin suele extenderse profundamente en los tejidos afectados. La inflamacin puede afectar diferentes reas del tubo digestivo, es decir, el intestino grueso, el intestino delgado o ambos.   Si bien la colitis colagenosa y la colitis linfoctica tambin se consideran enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales, se las suele separar de las enfermedades inflamatorias intestinales clsicas.

Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.   April 8, 2015         Talking to a woman about her weight during pregnancy  without putting her off from all future pregnancy checkups  is an art. Hopefully I have learned it, but undoubtedly I have offended a few women.   Of course, the reason health care providers stress appropriate weight gain during pregnancy is because it's good for mom and baby  not out of vanity. Recommended weight gain during pregnancy is based on your pre-pregnancy BMI, so lets start our discussion there. Part of having a healthy pregnancy is focusing on your health before you see those life-changing little pink lines.   As obesity has risen in the U.S., so have pregnancy complications. Having a BMI of 30 or more (and especially 40 or more), puts your pregnancy at risk for a long list of complications, including diabetes, high blood pressure and pregnancy loss. Benefits of achieving a healthy pre-pregnancy weight include:     You'll feel amazing   Getting pregnant might be easier   You'll minimize your risk for pregnancy complications     In addition, excess weight is often easier to lose before pregnancy than afterward, when you're busy healing and caring for your baby.   So how do you do it?     Educate yourself by meeting with a dietitian or nutritionist   Choose fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains   Burn calories by getting moving outside or by joining a gym   Make sure loved ones and friends understand and support your goals     Optimal health before pregnancy involves getting chronic illnesses under control, quitting smoking and seeking preconception counseling.

High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure also may increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.   Hydralazine works by relaxing blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

By  Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.   July 9, 2015         Most health and nutrition experts agree that Americans should increase their consumption of fish. Fish are high in protein and are low in calories, cholesterol and saturated fat.   Some varieties also are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been found to decrease the risk of heart disease and stroke. Omega-3 fatty acids can promote fetal brain development during pregnancy. These benefits come from fatty fish such as salmon, lake trout, herring, sardines and albacore tuna.   Because of these health benefits, the upcoming Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 recommend that adults eat 8 ounces of fish a week. Americans currently eat only half that amount.   It used to be that wild-caught fish were considered healthy. Over the past several decades, however, concerns have arisen about the effects heavy metal contaminants (such as mercury), pollutants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), pesticides, fertilizers and even trash have on the safety of water and fish. The demand for certain types of fish and some fishing practices, such as bottom trolling, have taken their toll on the environment and the availability of fish.   While fish farming (known as aquaculture) has been in place for centuries, its popularity has exploded in recent years because of the above concerns and the continued high demand for fish.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for overseeing U.S. aquaculture, reports that:     Aquaculture supplies more than 50 percent of seafood consumed in the U.S.   About 90 percent of U.S. seafood is imported  half of that is produced by aquaculture   U.S. aquaculture meets only 5 to 7 percent of U.S. demand for seafood     Although modern-day fish farming is designed to address safety concerns, it also has drawbacks. Some pens built in open water can be at the expense of the surrounding ecosystems, such as coastlines, underwater reefs, trees and swamps, and the wildlife that depend on them. Fish that are raised in areas where they're not normally found may escape and breed or compete with local fish  resulting in decreases in the wild species. Fish farms  including those in contained reservoirs  create enormous quantities of organic waste (feces) that can contaminate water in the surrounding environment if not handled properly.   At this time there's no easy answer when it comes to what type of fish to choose  wild-caught or farm-raised. However, to help you navigate the farm versus wild dilemma, here are a few tips:     Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding and young children should avoid tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish and king mackerel.   When buying local fish, check for advice. If information isn't available, adults should limit their consumption to 6 ounces a week, while young children should eat no more than 1 to 3 ounces a week.   Know which fish are overfished and avoid them. This gives at-risk species a chance to repopulate. There are groups that identify which fish are overfished, or caught or farmed in ways that cut the population or harm the environment. These include the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch and the Environmental Defense Fund Seafood Selector. Both have apps you can download.   Buy U.S. fish. The U.S. has strict environmental and food safety laws governing farmed and wild-caught fish. Purchasing U.S. fish is one way you can help ensure safety and sustainability.   Be an advocate. Whenever you purchase fish, ask where it's from and if it's sustainable. Grocers and restaurant owners in turn will question their suppliers and become advocates too.         With      Jennifer K.

Al Schultz       April 22, 2016 7:42 a.m.   I think you could have included Canada when you talked about strict environmental safety.  We too are concerned about having safe food.   Betty       April 21, 2016 9:14 p.m.   When buying farm grown things... Shrimp: they are clear in color and no taste ALWAYS BUY WILD CAUGHT. COME ON THE FARMS ARE FEEDING EITH GMOS   Rach       April 21, 2016 8:21 p.m.   SHOP RITE WHICH IS A SUPERMARKET CHAIN IN PHILA PA ALWAYS DISPLAYS IF THE FISH IS ""WILD CAUGHT OR FARM RAISED"". THEY ALSO DISPLAY WHERE THE FISH IS FROM.   PAT NASUTI       April 21, 2016 4:37 p.m.   Thank you for this report. Although I try to purchase wild caught and shrimp it is some times difficult. I will talk to the fifish monger from now on. Thanks   Mary Ann       April 21, 2016 4:11 p.m.   I buy fish from Sitka Salmon, a seafood CSA that sells fish caught off Alaska. I would call that wild, US fish and I'm sure it's as good as it can be. Also delicious.   Ellen       April 21, 2016 4:03 p.m.   If the public would demand fish that is from the USA and NOT CHINA or India and not buy them I am sure things would change.  The public is not educated or just don't care,   cindi symon       April 21, 2016 3:59 p.m.   cosco has fish and shrimp from India and all the dirty places,where water is not healthty   cindi symon       April 21, 2016 2:30 p.m.   Not very helpful.  Question:  Farm raised or wild caught??  You didn't answer!   Maxine Nelson       March 11, 2016 11:56 a.m.   One important information is that farm raised fish is fed grains and legumes which is typically what fish do not eat. This causes decreased in omega 3 and an increase in omega 6 which causes inflammation.   Bert       December 4, 2015 1:17 p.m.   I would choose wild fish that I've caught myself because its fresh and taste better.   Julianna Frichter       September 8, 2015 11:16 a.m.   I think that reading this article is right about you should buy the fish from the U.S. because they have a environmental program.   Dillan Mitchell       September 5, 2015 7:02 a.m.   From reading labels on frozen salmon I see that farmed salmon is much higher in fat than wild caught and some research shows that Omega 3's are lower. This is a result of their diet similar to the results of grain fed cattle vs grass fed.   Dave       August 13, 2015 8:43 a.m.   I think all fish that are sold in america should be raised in america and not ship in fish from overseas cause who know what they feed there fish with.We have so many fish farms in america for us not to get fish from them to eat.   josh lane       July 30, 2015 10:14 p.m.   Relating to fish and gout: aren't the kinds of fish that are not recommended for gout just the ones that ARE recommended for heart due to Omega-3 content ..  ""Selected seafood. Avoid the following types of seafood, which are higher in purines than others: anchovies, herring, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout, haddock, mackerel and tuna.""   Edith Lueke       July 9, 2015 3:29 p.m.   Here in our Midwest community all the fish that are available for sale in our grocery stores, is Fish from China. I don't buy fish that come from China as I've heard terrible things about how the fish are raised and fed. I wish to support our U.S. fishermen but their fish don't seem to be available to us. I wonder why our fish from our USA fishermen are not available in our grocery stores. Who is getting their fish instead of us???   Barbara Borkowski       July 9, 2015 1:42 p.m.   Farmed fish is contaminated with antibiotics dumped into the water to prevent the diseases associated with ""faming"" fish in confined, unnatural environments. They should be avoided. Wild caught is best. Just shop at a reputable fish monger or grocery and ask questions. It the vendor is a good one, it won't be carrying fish from endangered populations.   Susan       July 9, 2015 12:14 p.m.   Why not list the fish species that are ""overfished"" rather than require the reader to ""research"".  Or, at least put the links to reliable websites.

January 25, 2017         Fish are getting more attention in an American diet that is dominated by land animals. Why the focus on eating more seafood?   Fish and other seafood are lean sources of protein and good sources of minerals such as selenium, zinc, iodine, iron and B vitamins. Fatty fish have the additional benefits of healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A and D.   Yet many Americans are missing out on these benefits. Part of the reason may be confusion over mercury contamination and which types of fish are best avoided.   To help you navigate these murky waters, the Food and Drug Administration released ""Eating Fish: What Pregnant Women and Parents Should Know."" This guide provides advice suitable for everyone  men, women and children  on getting the nutritional benefits of fish while minimizing exposure to contaminants such as mercury.   The guide has three categories and recommendations of how much to eat:     Best choices  (eat 2-3 servings a week): anchovies, canned light tuna, cod, haddock, perch, salmon, sardines, scallops, shrimp, tilapia, trout, whitefish   Good choices  (eat 1 serving a week): albacore (white) tuna, ahi (yellowfin) tuna, bluefish, carp, grouper, halibut, mahi-mahi, snapper, striped bass, tilefish (Atlantic Ocean)   Avoid : bigeye tuna, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish (Gulf of Mexico)     Serving sizes are determined by age:     Children 2-3 years of age: 1 serving is 1 ounce (28 grams)   Children 4-7 years of age: 1 serving is 2 ounces (56 grams)   Children 8-10 years of age: 1 serving is 3 ounces (84 grams)   Adults and children 11 years of age or older: 1 serving is 4 ounces (112 grams)     Should you be worried if you ate a fish from the ""avoid"" list? No, but be sure to choose fish from the ""best"" and ""good"" categories going forward.   If you fish in and eat from local waters, follow fish advisories for that area. If no data is available, limit to 6 ounces of that fish a week for adults. For children under 6 years of age, limit to 1-2 ounces (28-56 grams). For those 6-12 years of age, limit to 2-3 ounces (56 to 84 grams).   Don't let the worry of contaminants take the enjoyment out of fishing and enjoying fish. Follow the advisories and the recommendations to regularly include fish in your diet.   Fish can be simple to prepare, making for a quick and nutritious meal. Fresh and pan seared, frozen and baked, or out of can and in a sandwich, there are options for every palate.

Would you consider posting another article about the dangers of eating fish from the Pacific, following the Japanese nuclear disaster?   Bev       January 31, 2017 10:01 a.m.   No mention of wild-caught being much better than farmed Atlantic salmon?  Bad advice again.   GJ       January 30, 2017 10:20 p.m.   Ms. Zeratsky needs to look up the radiation effects from Japan's Fukashima nuclear melt down... upon the fish from Alaska all along the West Coast to California.....and the radiation in the  Pacific ocean is supposed to last decades!!!  I  for one , am eating only East Coast fish.....   M.P. Meese       January 30, 2017 8:38 p.m.   Haha not for my wife.... I eat fish alone.

Do our fish now have radiation contamination and are they safe to eat?   Gary Mccormick       January 30, 2017 7:41 p.m.   Are the lice that have gone into wild salmon on the west coast from farmed salmon. bad for people eating the wild salmon?  Where are them posting guidelines. I haven't seen them?  I pressed Submit, but am being asked again.   Esther       January 30, 2017 6:26 p.m.   What about farm raised fish?  I find they have more fat content and are moister than wild caught.   Suzanne       January 30, 2017 5:52 p.m.   Why on earth would you avoid orange roughy, a New Zealand-caught fish?

Background Vitamin D is found in many foods, including fish, eggs, fortified milk, and cod liver oil. The sun also adds to the body's daily production of vitamin D, and as little as 10 minutes of exposure is thought to prevent deficiency.   The term ""vitamin D"" refers to several different forms of this vitamin. Two forms are important in humans: vitamin D2, which is made by plants, and vitamin D3, which is made by human skin when exposed to sunlight. Foods may be fortified with vitamin D2 or D3.   The major role of vitamin D is to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which forms and maintains strong bones. It is used alone or together with calcium to improve bone health and decrease fractures. Vitamin D may also protect against osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cancer, and other diseases.   Rickets and osteomalacia are classic vitamin D deficiency diseases. In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, which is a softening or weakening of the bones. In adults, vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, which causes weak bones and muscles. People who may be at a high risk for vitamin D deficiency include those who are elderly or obese, those with limited sun exposure, and babies who are exclusively breastfed. People who have conditions such as cystic fibrosis (mucus build-up in the lungs) or inflammatory bowel disease are also at risk for vitamin D deficiency.

But that doesn't mean it's too late to adopt new, healthy habits. By Angela L. Murad             Making healthy changes doesn't require you to completely overhaul your diet. Start at your own pace by practicing these key healthy-eating habits.     Eat breakfast       Research indicates that eating breakfast every day helps with weight loss and weight maintenance by reducing hunger later in the day. When you break the overnight fast with a healthy breakfast, it's easier to resist unhealthy choices during the day.   Include at least two food groups  such as whole grains, lean protein, dairy, or fruits and vegetables  at breakfast to put you on track for a day of healthy eating.     Drink water       Water is a crucial nutrient that often gets overlooked. Sixty percent of your body weight is made up of water and every system in your body requires it to function properly. Fluid needs depend on several factors: your health, your environment, how active you are, and if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. The Institute of Medicine recommends that men need about 13 8-ounce cups of water a day and women need nine 8-ounce cups of water a day.   Sometimes thirst can be misinterpreted as hunger. Check in with your body when you feel hungry, especially later in the day. Drinking a glass of water before eating can satisfy thirst and keep you from eating unnecessary calories.

February 20, 2014         The word is out. Nuts are good for you. A growing body of research supports their role in weight control, heart health and decreasing death from all causes. In addition, most nuts are good sources of fiber, potassium, zinc and iron. So what is the best nut? That depends on your personal preference as well as any health concerns you have. Here are some nutrient highlights to help you choose.     Weight loss or maintenance.  Almonds might be a good choice for you. The combination of protein, fiber and fat is the trifecta of satiety. Add almonds to your breakfast cereal or yogurt, or sprinkle some on your salad later in the day.   Weight gain.  Looking for a healthy way to gain weight? Pecans and macadamia nuts have the most calories in an ounce (that's a handful). Most of these calories come from the abundance of healthy, monounsaturated fats.   Fuel for athletes.  Cashews have more carbohydrates and iron than other nuts. They are good sources of protein and zinc  key nutrients for cell growth and repair. Throw them in your gym bag for a quick snack.    Blood pressure control.  Sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium are major players in blood pressure control. Pistachios and brazil nuts have higher amounts of these heart healthy nutrients. Make a fruit and nut salad.    Pregnancy.  A small handful of nuts when you're not feeling well or feel full too soon is a great source of calories and key nutrients for a growing baby. Among nuts, hazelnuts have the most folate. They also have iron and zinc.   Healthy aging.  Ongoing research on omega-3 fatty acids and their role in brain and heart health should help keep nuts on your radar. Nuts, especially walnuts, are high in polyunsaturated fats. Walnuts, like most nuts, are versatile and can be added to cereal, ground into a butter, or used as a crust or topping on meat, fish, pilafs and vegetables.     The nutrients you get from a small amount of nuts is impressive. Perhaps even more convincing is how easy it is to add these nutrient powerhouses to your diet. It doesn't get much easier than packing a bag in your purse, briefcase or backpack. Just keep an eye on portion size.   How do you enjoy nuts? Have you added nuts to your diet and seen any changes?

Read comments       July 10, 2016 6:02 p.m.   Dear readers,  Thank you for your comments and questions regarding nuts. A serving of nuts is an ounce. One ounce of nuts is roughly 8-25 nuts (49 shelled pistachios = 1 ounce)  and will provide 160-200 calories depending on the nut you choose. Your portion may differ and is okay as along as you are able to balance your calorie intake and level of activity to maintain a healthy weight.  Peanuts are in the legume family with beans, lentils, and peas. All are a good source of plant protein. Like these other plants, peanuts may offer health benefits from fiber, minerals such as iron and zinc, and other phytonutrients.  Like other nuts, peanuts are a good source of healthy fats. 1 ounce of peanuts is about 28 kernels and 160 calories.   Katherine, your blog host       July 5, 2016 9:01 a.m.   I often eat a handful of nuts (usually almonds or Brazil nuts; occasionally cashews or pecans) as my evening meal if I've consumed a complete lunch. They satisfy my slight hunger and carry me through to breakfast. Also, in the past I've found nuts to be an excellent aide in weight loss. I have no scientific backup, but at least in my case I truly believe they helped rev up my metabolism and increased my weight loss.   Janet       July 4, 2016 3:07 p.m.   Great article! Peanuts are not nuts, but how do they compare to nuts and where do they fit the article?   Gordon - gemenuz@shaw.ca       July 4, 2016 1:57 p.m.   Thanks for a really great article, Katherine! I am a clinical RDN -- and have been spreading the word as well re: nutrition value of nuts. I like your specific nut recommendations for different groups of people/ conditions.  Spot on!!   Stephanie       July 4, 2016 12:19 p.m.   Other than Omega-3s, what nutrients are in walnuts?   geraf       July 4, 2016 12:10 p.m.   Are peanuts good for us?   cathygrimm2@gmail.com       July 4, 2016 11:37 a.m.   I used to get sores in my mouth from eating walnuts.  I found that if I increased the amount little by little, they went away and my body got used to it.  I now put them in everything; cereal, salad, snacks, yogurt, etc.  They have made my cholesterol go down and it's because of the high Omega-3. What can be better than adding walnuts with chocolate? Brownies without walnuts are BORING!  To me, pairing walnuts with anything chocolate makes the flavor come alive.  To your health!   Baking in the sun       April 18, 2016 12:07 a.m.   Thank you very much for the useful information, I am a nuts addict but ignorant of their respective uses and nutritional value until now. With this newly founded knowledge I know what nuts to consume in future. Keep up the good work and God Bless!   George Ee       April 15, 2016 3:29 p.m.   Nuts - Oh my Lord - I'm nutty about nuts.  I always buy all kinds of nuts (always unsalted) and sometimes, for dinner, I put a big handful of nuts, all kinds of fruits, a piece of cheese and along I go.   I finish it up with 2 pieces of dark Godiva chocolate.   Believe you me I sleep like a baby.

Brazil,almonds,cashews,walnuts,macadamia nuts. This keeps me going strongly until my light lunch. I feel strong for my 73 years. I do worry about being able to buy FRESH nuts. My macadamia tree fruits only once a year. Is there any secret in telling not so fresh nuts?   Pamela O'Sullivan488       April 14, 2016 2:41 p.m.   I love nuts ---what is a healthy portion?   Jan Tunstall       April 14, 2016 2:24 p.m.   I used to take almonds as first thing in the morning. After my blood test results showed potassium level of 6 & my doctor told me to cut on foods with potassium. I noticed that foods like almonds, avocado, carrots etc. contained potassium and was cautious & these items. Unfortunately the labels on food containers don't show potassium content often. I thought it was safe that way, may be. Please advise.

Added to that are a few almonds and walnuts.  Possibly the nuts are the reason I'm not on any prescriptions at the age of 86.   Renie       July 14, 2015 1:49 a.m.   I love nuts.  Almonds, pecans, walnuts.  I also love peanuts but can't have them as I am allergic to mold and peanuts are grown in mold.  I buy organic nuts and nut butters....esp. crunch almond butter and pecan butter...though pecan butter comes one way: smooth.   Nina       July 13, 2015 12:09 p.m.   I buy our nuts from a vendor in the Jerusalem shuk, and I always choose salt-free.  I get a half kilo of several different kinds.  Once a day, a have a portion of each kind.  When nuts are salt-free, you really get to taste their flavor.   Susan Ireland       July 13, 2015 11:41 a.m.   You didn't mention peanuts.  Why?

We usually keep almonds at home.  Sometimes my mother will buy even the natural ones, too.  We also buy pistachios.  I am going to ask my mama to start buying cashews once I start back playing soccer since they are fuel for athletes.

I just recently started drinking almond milk, which I do enjoy, but would still love to eat nuts.

By  Julie A. Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.   August 3, 2016         Chances are you've heard of the trend of women eating their placenta after giving birth (placentophagy). It's often done by drying the placenta, grinding it up and making it into capsules for the new mother to consume during the first postpartum weeks. Supporters of the practice say that it helps with postpartum depression, bleeding, energy, pain and milk supply.   The placenta is an intricate organ that begins forming at the moment of implantation  when the fertilized egg burrows into the wall of the uterus. The organ nourishes the growing fetus by exchanging nutrients and oxygen for waste products via the umbilical cord. Its development and function is nothing short of amazing. Is there usefulness, however, to the placenta after birth?   Supporters point to research that suggests benefits for postpartum women. But these studies tend to lack in convincing evidence. They focus on animal research and anecdotal experiences or they're poorly designed. To date, there is no reliable research on humans that supports the benefits of placentophagy. (Hint: Let's get some!)   Several animals eat their placenta. Although it's not exactly clear, it's possible that the placenta gives them ready access to nutrition after the tiring process of birth and helps them hide evidence of a recent birth from predators. In other words, this act serves needs that humans haven't had in a long time.   Until the proven benefits or harms of consuming your placenta are clear, use caution. If you decide to proceed, do your own research to ensure that the placenta processor (say that ten times fast) has been trained and certified. Careful processing is a necessity because placentas carry blood-borne diseases.   Whether the idea of eating your placenta sparks your curiosity or turns your stomach, you have to agree that the placenta is a pretty cool organ. After your baby is born and you have had the chance to snuggle, admire and bond with your little one, ask your provider to show you the organ and give you a little Placenta 101. It was, after all, your baby's lifeline for all those months!       With      Julie A. Lamppa, C.N.M., R.N.

Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   December 17, 2009          One of my earliest memories is of my mother nursing my youngest brother  yet when I started my medical career as a nursing assistant at age 16, breastfeeding wasn't the norm. There were no lactation consultants and women weren't offered much help breast-feeding their babies. At the time, parents were quick to offer formula.      During my years as a labor and delivery nurse, breast-feeding began to increase in popularity. Still, no one ever told me how difficult breast-feeding could be. When I breast-fed my own baby, I naively accepted everything that happened as the norm  even though my nipples were so tender that I'd cringe every time the baby latched on. I thought that I had a baby and two breasts, so everything should be easy. I was embarrassed to admit that I didn't know what I was doing, so I just plowed ahead. It wasn't until much later that I realized how lucky I was to be able to stick with it and be successful.      I think one of the biggest pieces of information that is too often not passed on to new moms is that breast-feeding isn't easy for at least the first two weeks. Nothing can really prepare your nipples for a nursing baby. Babies are born knowing how to suck, but they don't know how to suck on a breast. If this is your first baby, you may not be comfortable holding a baby  let alone putting a baby to your breast. And since breasts don't have ounce markers, you never know for sure how much milk the baby is getting.      If you're planning to breast-feed your baby, don't hesitate to ask for help. Most hospitals have lactation consultants on staff who can answer your questions or help you resolve any problems you may encounter. Remember, just as your body knows what it's doing during pregnancy and childbirth, your body knows how to support a breast-feeding baby. Have faith in your body's ability to meet your baby's nutritional needs.         With      Mary M.

My milk supply dried up due to stress at work and not enough time to pump while at work. I also had excruciating pain for the first few months of nursing. I recently gave birth to my son (8 weeks ago) and he has been so different. I had to go one weekend of having him on a bottle instead of nursing.  Now he is super fussy on the breast.  I am using a nipple shield and that seems to help but I am not producing enough milk to send to daycare for the day.  I am getting a bit stressed.  I visited with a lactation consultant who had told me about the shield.  Another thing she told me about, that I was never told, was that there are different size flanges for my breast pump!  I bought a bigger size flange and they have been much more comfortable than the size that came with the pump.  I was able to pump enough milk in the first 2 weeks to put in the freezer but now I have had to start using those because I am not producing enough in a day. Does tiredness have anything to do with my milk supply?  Is it ok to do formula and breast milk? How / when to rotate the two? I am trying to hang in there but am quickly getting discouraged.  My spouse doesn't seem to understand what I am going through or feeling.     Amy       October 23, 2012 2:12 p.m.   @ Judy. I went through the same exact thing as you did. I pumped and supplemented as well and it allowed me to pump enough milk for 2 days at a time. Yes it can be a pain when ur hooked up to a machine, but if you're able to pump and store, it works as well.  After 6 months I decided that formula was gonna be my final choice. Don't listen to what others have to say as its all opinions and everyone experience(s) are different.   Tajuana       August 21, 2012 3:28 p.m.   Oh thank goodness for all you moms out there who shared your story - my daughter is 17 days old and breastfeeding has been a horrid. My nipples were cracked, red, raw from the beginning. Hospital lactation consultants told me my baby's latch was perfect, my nipples just needed to toughen up. Yeah - 48 hours later I was still breastfeeding and literally biting into a hand towel to scream because the pain was so excruciating. I ended up going to 4 breastfeeding classes led by an RN/IBCLC and I was given OTC ointment to heal the nipples and pumped and bottle fed (supplementing with formula if needed) while my nipples healed. I just tried breastfeeding again today and the pain was still excruciating. After crying literally everyday, I decided today no more breastfeeding and I'll have to continue to pump. My husband is wonderful and feeds our daughter a bottle while I pump each time. I'm hoping my milk supply will increase soon as we literally cannot leave the house b/c I have to pump. I've come THIS close to quitting and just going to formula but I'll keep on pumping and feeding our daughter breastmilk as long as I can.  I'm tired of so many people and articles quoting 'breast is best' that i felt like a failure and inadequate mother b/c I was pumping. After talking to several of my girl friends (who are mothers) it's helped me realize not all babies are the same and I'm doing the best I can for my child and if that means bottles with occasional formula - so be it.     Judy       June 23, 2012 3:51 p.m.   My baby is 9 1/2 months old and I'm still breastfeeding him and plan on breastfeeding him til he is a year old. He's never had formula. I've been told by doctors and nurses how good of a job I've been doing breastfeeding. He is at a healthy weight and is growing great. Breastfeeding for me has been the best thing I've ever done. It was hard for the first two weeks but after that it was really easy for me. Breastfeeding is great because you never have to make bottles, you can just go out the door with your baby and milk is already ready for you at anytime! It's great for night time feedings because you never have to get up and make a bottle you just got to pick up your baby and put him in bed with you and feed him. I think breastfeeding is great for mom and baby. I lost my baby weight real fast after my son was born because of breastfeeding! And I know I'm doing the best for my baby! So good job to all the mom's breastfeeding there baby's!!!!!!   Terri       May 17, 2012 4:45 a.m.   Jerome is now 3 weeks old. My 1st attempt resulted in a blister on my nipple. I could not latch him properly on the left, I dreaded feeds. Premature, we needed to dig him up to feed every 3 hours. I saw a lactation consultant who helped with the latch, and it doesn't hurt anymore, but seriously, knowing he wets 6-8 diapers a day doesn't make me feel as if I've enough milk. My self-worth is tied to the amount I pump at night, whether or not he fed from both breasts and if he sleeps 3 hours at a time. Breastfeeding is hard. Harder than anything I've ever done. But just like everything else which is learnt, it gets easier once it works. As my gyne told me, delegate. You need to keep your sanity. If he won't latch, pump and let someone else feed him. You have a million feeds to go, dropping a few feeds a day won't mean you can't bond with your child.   Katrina       April 23, 2012 10:37 p.m.   I had heard breastfeeding was challenging but if you could just get through the first couple of weeks all would be fine. It didn't exactly happen that way for me. I experienced Mastitis along with the joy of breastfeeding. Talk about painful. I had no clue I had Mastitis and thought red spider veins, ultra tenderness &amp; cracking nipples was part of the deal. Wrong. I had Mastitis for almost 6 weeks. I battled through the pain because I knew it would all be worth it. My baby girl is 16 weeks &amp; has the cutest chubby little legs. She is one healthy baby. My piece of advice would be: mentally battle through the pain, surround yourself with supportive family/friends &amp; imagine the happiness you will experience once your baby is able to latch on by his/herself &amp; looks up to smile at you during a feeding. It's the best feeling &amp; makes me tear up thinking of her little smile. Priceless. Best of luck to all!   Lori       April 21, 2012 11:54 p.m.   I have a 2 day old baby boy and he loves to cluster feed. The cluster feedings will last for hours. He always wants something in his mouth. Should I just give in and give him a pacifier when he gets this way?    Daisy       March 14, 2012 7:57 p.m.   It's funny how I can relate to this post.,I never knew that breastfeeding is hard..I am a first time mom of a 10 days old baby.I really wanted to breastfeed my baby 'coz I know it is the best for my baby.Few days ago,whenevee my baby latch on me I'd be close to crying because it hurts so much and now I'm still waiting for my nipple to get used to him sucking. As of now,since,I can't tolerate the pain.I don't know if it's okay to pump my breast than physically letting him to suck my breast.   Mary       March 3, 2012 10:16 a.m.   Breastfeeding has been the most challenging aspect of new motherhood for me, by far.  I had decided that we would be breastfeeding for a year - took the classes, read up, bought a pump for when I have to return to work.  I never counted on my daughter not latching.  I worked with the lactation consultant several times a day at the hospital, but had to start giving her formula because of jaundice.  I pumped and gave her colostrum by syringe.  When we got home, I pumped every time she took a bottle, and I was able to eventually produce enough to eliminate the formula.  All I did was pump, feed and wash bottles - and cry.  Then I got a clogged duct and mastitis, and it was back to supplementing formula.  I figured if I have to use formula anyway, I'm cutting back on the pumping.  She'd get what I could manage, but I didn't want to waste my maternity leave bonding with a breast pump.  Giving up is the best thing I did.  Eventually I was able to pump enough in fewer sessions to feed all breast milk.  I was just trying to get to 2 months b/f switching to formula.  At 6 weeks, my daughter started screaming while I was pumping so I made a last ditch effort to get her on the breast and it worked!  It's only been 2 days bottle-free, and I no longer pretend to know how we'll handle tomorrow.  All you need to know is that one way or another, you will make sure you baby gets fed and do what works best for your family.   That's all that matters.   Tisha       February 6, 2012 2:03 p.m.   I had a similar experience with my oldest more than 12 years ago. Breastfeeding was simply horrid. We tried all the usual tips, but I was frustrated and in constant pain every feeding -- and my baby was probably no better off. At about 4 weeks, her doctor finally told me to let it go. I wasn't doing either of us any good by being so stressed and frustrated. Once I had the doctor's &quot;permission&quot; to do what worked for us, I felt so much better and actually started to enjoy my baby. I think my state of mind was way more important for my baby's health than my ability to breastfeed. I'm glad for women who are able to breastfeed or even like it (!) but I've never regretted my own decision to stop.   Maddie       February 1, 2012 9:49 p.m.   My daughter is 3 weeks old and I was set on exclusively breastfeeding her. Once I had her however and we tried she would not latch on for anything. She would suckle for a few seconds and them scream bloody murder everytime. The lactation consultant at the hospital tried multiple things including a nipple shield ( because mine were not really sticking out) to putting a little formula on my nipple to trick the baby. We tried for 2 weeks to get her to nurse at every feeding for the first 15 minutes like we were recommended to do. We could never get her to latch on. I no longer attempt to breastfeed her so I have to pump and supplement with formula because I don't produce enough for her. She was born 10lb 9 oz and needs to eat more than the average sized baby. In the end I'm disappointed that I can't breastfeed my baby but my pediatrician told me that some babies just will not take a breast, especially is they don't want to work for the food like my daughter. But the 2 weeks I tried were very difficult emotionally because I felt like such a failure that I couldn't do the most basic thing: feed my baby. If this happens to you and you have a baby that just won't latch just know that it's not your fault. Some babies just will not take a breast.    Sarah       January 28, 2012 1:53 p.m.   Wonderful article. It's been great to read everyone's experiences. I am lucky that my son and I fell into a groove early on with breastfeeding and he's been exclusively breastfed for almost five months now. I do remember the beginning being very hard but definitely worth the bonding we've had together. Here's some advice that helped me throughout: 1) If the latch is proper, breastfeeding should not hurt. For me, it was a little painful as he latched (only in the beginning weeks) but then the pain went away. If I was in pain while he was nursing, it usually meant that I needed to readjust his latch. 2) Cracked and sore nipples are a reality of breastfeeding but go away after a few weeks. The nurses at the hospital recommended a saline rinse to cleanse/soothe followed by lanolin and cups allowing them to air dry. Worked wonders! 3) If breastfeeding doesn't work out, many babies are perfectly healthy and happy with breastmilk from a bottle and/or formula. Having a backup container of formula in the pantry helped ease my stress and ultimately helped us to be successful. 4) Find a support system of other moms who can answer your questions when you have them. Good luck ladies!   Ally       August 12, 2011 10:23 a.m.   I find there is a lot of pressure on new mums to breast feed, regardless of how painful or harmful it is for mom and baby. I had mastitis and would rather go through birth again than to breast feed ever again. In the end, I pumped, used bottles, and formula to supplement, and my baby boy is happy and healthy. The whole process was certainly more hygienic than using cracked, bleeding and infected nipples!! But I was angry at the amount of pressure I faced from health officials to breastfeed. I ended up on antibiotics and the baby had to be formula fed for a few weeks anyway. Instead of focusing on whether you breastfeed or not, why not focus on whether your baby is getting the right kind of nutrients in the most comfortable way? What's wrong with pumping and bonding with your baby that way? It seems to me that the issue is formula vs. breastmilk vs. combo, not bottles vs. breastfeeding. Regarding the breastmilk issue, experience from my friends also indicates that not everyone has got good quality breastmilk with all the needed nutrients - it's good to get analysis done. Some moms should supplement with formula whether they like it or not - it's the health of the child that matters, not any outdated preconception of what bonding with your baby should look like to everyone else.    Eva       August 1, 2011 7:53 p.m.   I watched my daughter try to breast feed her firstborn(my 1st grandchild)for 5 days,and be devastated that the &quot;latch&quot; she thot was good, was not. Therefore provoking a doubt of her own observations.  The baby screamed hysterically 4nites and could NOT be comforted; she slept from crying exhaustion. I was there to do all housework while they tried to get baby to nurse. There was a discharge lactatn conslt as well as an appt after 2 days home.  That 2nd appt figured out my daughter did not have a good &quot;latch&quot;(when prev she thot she did)and the babys seeming daytime behavior was merely putting up with unsatisfactory feedings.  At nite the reality set in, hence the nite-time screaming from hunger.  Lacation specialists who are not available 24/7 are NOT available.  No one should have to listen to their baby be hungry.   Marge       November 24, 2010 8:52 p.m.   I just had my third baby, and am suffering with the pain of the first week of breastfeeding. Again. I just want to reassure women that it does get better. It usually takes me about two weeks for my nipples to 'toughen up'. Those couple of weeks are brutal, and I end up with a backache from tensing up every time the baby latches on. But it is worth it. The pain will go away. The bonding with baby is priceless.   Marlene       November 5, 2010 9:48 a.m.   Koraline, there is no way to know if the pain would have gone away or not.  For some women it can take up to 6 weeks before it gets comfortable.  You should be proud that you continue to give the baby pumped breast milk.  You are working hard to give your baby what she needs.     mary @ Mayo       October 26, 2010 10:50 p.m.   It's nice to know that it's not a breeze for anyone.  I breastfeed for 2 weeks then bought a pump because it hurt too much.  My baby had a hard time staying latched and I couldn't keep her awake to get a full feeding.  Unfournately, I do not nurse anymore, but I do pump everytime she feeds.  Sometimes I do have to use formula when my milk is low.   Q:  Could anyone tell me if the pain would have subsideded if I continued to nurse? And at about how many weeks does it feel bareable?   Koraline       October 10, 2010 2:34 p.m.   It's really amazing to find out that so many women struggle with breastfeeding. When we're going through it I think we all feel very alone, and as if there's something wrong with us because we can't do something as 'natural' as breastfeeding. I found another account of a lady's first 6 weeks of breastfeeding which I found very comforting in the early stages. http://www.pregnancyweekbyweek.us/stages-of-pregnancy/breastfeeding-part-1 I think it's so important that new mom's know they're not alone and that they have someone to ask for help.     Caroline       August 29, 2010 6:07 a.m.   Thank you for the article. It really is very tough. I thought it would be natural but BF'ing takes a lot of patience and persistence when you have sore/cracked/bleeding nipples like I do. I have been supplementing with formula and pumping as I am in too much pain. Its been 2 weeks now but am hoping it will get better.   gfromatl       August 1, 2010 2:24 p.m.   My baby is 10 weeks old now and started to cry each time after only 4-5 minutes of sucking. He seems to get only 60-80 ml of milk during those 5 minutes. Any obvious best practices to apply to improve this? There is plenty of milk, and he used to eat over 100ml at once few weeks ago... Also, he is extremely active, so 60 ml look terrible not enough. Thanks!   Anca       April 14, 2010 10:41 p.m.   I agree with this article completely! Nobody told me it was difficult to breastfeed. During the first two weeks, both my nipples bled and my baby was shouting because she can't get milk. I was in so much pain that time. I rushed to a lactation consultant who gave me tips on proper breasfeeding. However since my breasts were too painful and I was not producing enough milk, I had to give my baby formula. Anyway, I pumped every two hours for two weeks so I can have &quot;relactation.&quot; Eventually my milk supply increased. Now I have a good supply of milk.  Breastfeeding is a challenge and a commitment. I'm so proud of myself and the other moms who breastfeed their babies!   bella       March 22, 2010 1:42 p.m.   I think that we need all the help we can get when we first start nursing.  Lactation Consultants and the La Leche League are good resources.  Don't forget your friends and family who have successfully breastfed.  They may have good insights also, as well as empathy.   Mary@Mayo       February 11, 2010 11:09 a.m.   I had a very difficult time at first breastfeeding my son. I am a nurse - and knew it would be difficult, but had no idea!!  In the end, it was worth all the tears and frustration.  My son is now 9 months old and I wouldn't have it any other way.  My experience with lactation consultants was amazing - I recommend them to every expectant mom that I know!  They were so supportive and creative in ways to help me out.  I don't know if I could have made it without them.  :)   Kristin        January 12, 2010 3:02 p.m.   There was no one to help me when my first child was born.  but, I breastfed all 5 of my children and would definitely to it all over again.  yes, I had sore nipples but worked through it.  I loved the time spent breastfeeding - just me and my baby.    Ann       January 1, 2010 2:02 a.m.   Thank you, Mary, for this article! I too believed that it was all just supposed to happen naturally, when it really took us six weeks to get it down. My nipples were so raw, I had to pump, which stressed me out so much I wasn't making any milk! Anyway, it took the help of a lactation consultant to calm me down and let me know that what I was experiencing was normal. I'm so glad I stuck with it because it was a great experience in the end, all 14 months! I also found La Leche League to be helpful in support of my experiences, but the real learning came between me and my son.    Sydney       December 23, 2009 2:36 p.m.   La Leche League is a wonderful resource/support for new moms. Try to go to a meeting before your baby is born, meet other women and develop a support system. The book, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, is a good resource.  Breastfeeding is a learned &quot;art&quot;, but, oh so rewarding, for baby and for mom.  Ask for help and support, then follow your gut and your baby's lead.   Melinda       December 23, 2009 10:46 a.m.   I had breastfeeding knowledge and a certificate as a breastfeeding educator before having my first baby. Inspite of this I had a hard time breastfeeding my li'l one, he refused to latch, lactation consultants tried to help me but couldn't get him to latch. My newborn went without feeding for 6 hrs.As a last resort I pumped and supplemented with formula. I was told that I was one of the few women who have very low milk supply. My breastfeeding experience was horrifying as it included problems ranging from sore nipples to mastitis and ofcourse poor milk supply.   Blueberry       December 20, 2009 1:20 p.m.   Sal's advice is good. Despite my hospital's loud trumpeting of its UNICEF &quot;baby-friendly&quot; designation, I had to wait 2 weeks to see a lactation consultant.  You can't wait 2 weeks to make sure your baby's getting enough food, so the options really are to hire someone yourself or start supplementing with formula.   Lisa       December 19, 2009 5:21 p.m.   The lactation consultants in our hospital were overworked and often unavailable.  Best to pay a midwife or doula to come to the hospital after you have delivered your baby to help you get through the early weeks.  In the long run it will still be cheaper than buying formula.    It wo   Sal       December 19, 2009 10:43 a.m.   kim~~Why would using bottles be a bad thing? I breastfed my baby but was unable to do so without bottles.    Chrissy       December 17, 2009 3:42 p.m.   I agree...nobody prepares you for breastfeeding!  It took me 6-8 weeks to get in the groove.  It was so painful but I was determined to not use bottles!  Don't forget it is a learning experience for mom and baby to figure out what they are doing!   kim                 Eating the placenta: A good idea? Breast milk sharing: How does it work?

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   February 9, 2016         Lead poisoning is in the news, but it's hardly new. Symptoms of lead poisoning were apparent in ancient Rome and included personality changes, sterility, stillbirth, mental incompetence and death. Lead was used to season food and preserve wine. It was found in pewter cups, plates, pots and pans. Ancient Rome had lead water pipes. Interestingly, even today lead poisoning is sometimes called ""plumbism.""   Because of the tragedy of lead-polluted water in Flint, Michigan, I got curious about lead in my tap water and other potential sources of lead in my home.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the only way to know if tap water contains lead is to test it. You can also check with your water provider to see if the service pipe at the street (header pipe) has lead. If the service pipe does not have lead, then the plumbing (fixtures, pipes, faucets) in your home is the likely source.   In 1978, the federal government banned lead-containing paint. However, it is estimated that 24 million homes in the U.S. contain deteriorating lead-based paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust. Furthermore, soil around older homes painted with lead-based paint can be contaminated when the paint flakes and peels.   Children and adults can ingest lead through contact with contaminated paint, dust and soil. The CDC recommends having your home inspected by a licensed lead inspector. Your local health department can provide more information on this. If your home has lead, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that you hire a lead-safe renovator  someone who knows how to minimize creation of lead-containing hazardous dust.   Children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to the effects of lead exposure. Lead exposure puts pregnant women at risk for miscarriage, premature birth, smaller babies, and damage to the baby's brain, kidneys and nervous system. Infants and children under age 6 are growing quickly and their bodies absorb more lead than adults, and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to lead damage. They are at risk for slow growth and development, damage to hearing and speech, attention deficits and lower academic achievement   Prompted by my research, I called my local water department. They were able to tell me that my service pipe does not have lead. I am still going to get my tap water tested. I accessed the EPA website and found a resource to come do a risk assessment that includes looking for lead in paint, dust and soil.   I'll let you know what I find out.       With      Jennifer K.

I have consumed Ayurvedic medicine for just 6 months, where in the mixture had lead in it as high as 21kppm. After 6 months I experienced energy drain, muscle , abdomen pains very severely.  When I went to have Lead test with my primary care i was diagnosed with 120BLL in 2014. Its been 2 years from then where my BLL now fluctuating between teen's and twenties.   Doctors have hard time suggesting natural methods to get the lead out.Chelation can be done only till certain point after that it depends on our metabolism to reduce or stabilize it. I am yet find a good approach to remove lead naturally from the body.  However if any one has any suggestions I would greatly help.  If you are introducing any new stuff to your body always be doubly sure of the side effects.   Neha       September 21, 2016 12:48 p.m.   I have a question more than a comment.  Can you direct me to how to address lead exposure I had as a child in the 1970s?  I grew up from age 4-15 (1972-1983) in the East Chicago, Indiana West Calumet Housing Project which recently was found to have lead counts as high as 91,000 ppm.  I assume I was exposed to the lead, as it was present from before the building of the housing project.  I am 49 years old now.  Should I get tested or is it too late to show that it was ever in my system?   I could really use help with this.

FinchC8cNx       February 15, 2016 1:28 p.m.   Last Summer (2015) I was diagnosed with lead poisoning through a Heavy Metal Test done by my physician. I had been having a myriad of symptoms including joint and muscle pain, rapid acceleration of osteo-arthritus, seizures, headaches, miscarraiges, etc. After the diagnosis my physician put me on chelation therapy with twice daily capsules of to clear my system. After about two months, the bone-deep exhaustion and pain that I have dealt with for years started going away and little by little some of my other symptoms decreased. Unfortunately the length of time that I had elevated lead amounts in my system has done some irreversible bone damage and I now have bone-on-bone arthritis in must weight bearing joints.  When searching for the likely culprit for my exposure, we have pretty much narrowed it down to  lead paint that I was exposed to while I worked doing some home remodeling over 30 years ago. Fortunately my daughter (17) tested ok but my older child (mid 20) has some exposure also.  I learned the hard way that while older houses have a lot of charm and personality, they also have a lot of invisible health risks.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   December 3, 2013         The holiday season is a time when we're often called on to make and take food to a variety of events. Now's the perfect time to brush up on food safety tips to ensure that your celebrations don't go awry.   The first thing to keep in mind is that some people are at greater risk of serious illness or even death from foodborne illness. Those at higher risk are infants, young children, pregnant women and their unborn babies, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, such as those who've had a transplant or who have HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes or kidney disease.   Here some tips to keep your feasts safe:      Clean. Use hot soapy water to wash your hands, utensils, and work surfaces (including cutting boards). Repeat this throughout your preparation to ensure you aren't spreading bacteria around.    Separate. Keep raw meat and poultry separate from other foods (cooked or raw). Use separate cutting boards or platters for meats, fruits and vegetables, and other foods.   Cook. Use a food thermometer. Cook turkey and other poultry to an internal temperature of 165 F (145 F for other roasts, steaks, or chops). Take the temperature at the innermost part of the bird's thigh and wing  and the thickest part of the breast. Stuffing should also be 165 F. Boil gravies, sauces and soups.   Keep it hot or cold. If serving buffet style, maintain safe temperatures. Keep hot foods hot (140 F or warmer) by using chafing dishes, slow cookers and warming trays. Keep cold foods cold (40 F or cooler) by nesting in bowls of ice.      Here are some safety tips if you're going to be transporting food:     Cook food completely, to its safe cooking temperature. Don't transport partially cooked foods.   Minimize temperature fluctuations. Remove food from the stove/oven just before leaving home. Carefully transfer food to a thermal container or slow cooker, wrap in heavy towels for extra insulation and place in a thermal tote or insulated bag. Use a cooler and/or ice to transport cold foods.   When you arrive, reheat hot foods to 165 degrees or boiling for liquids. Before serving, bring food up to the safe temperature (165 F). Get cold foods in to the refrigerator until ready for serve.     And finally, here's how to safely handle leftovers:     Refrigerate all leftovers in shallow containers within 2 hours of serving (1 hour if the air temperature is above 90 F).    Properly stored leftovers can be kept for 3 to 4 days. But if in doubt, throw them out. Be sure to reheat leftovers to 165 F before serving.   Consider leaving leftovers with the host. By the time you reach home, the food likely will be the in the danger zone  between 40 F and 140 F  when bacteria can quickly multiple.     How do you ensure food safety at home or when sharing a meal with family and friends?   Wishing you enjoyable and safe holiday meals,   Jennifer and Katherine       With      Jennifer K.

By  Mary M. Murry, R.N., C.N.M.   February 9, 2011          I'd like to think that I have a perfect diet. However, I'm well aware of the M&Ms that pass my lips every day, and I could stand to eat more iron-rich foods. You're probably in touch with your own diet shortcomings, too. During pregnancy, though, you're likely to become more conscious of what and how much you eat. Enter prenatal vitamins.     I'm not sure of many pills larger than traditional prenatal vitamins. Here's a pregnant woman, fighting nausea and expected to swallow a pill the size of her thumb and then keep it down! Still, prenatal vitamins help you get enough folic acid, iron and other essential nutrients. If you're on a special diet  such as gluten free, vegetarian or vegan  or have other specific needs, your health care provider may recommend other nutritional supplements.     There's an important caveat, though. Prenatal vitamins aren't meant to replace the nutrients you get from food. They just make sure you don't fall short on key nutrients.     If you're having trouble taking prenatal vitamins  or keeping them down  it might help to take the vitamins at night or with a snack. You might also chew gum or suck on hard candy afterward. If the vitamins seem to make you constipated, remember to drink plenty of water. It might also help to include more fiber in your diet and get regular physical activity.

Read comments       July 1, 2011 6:27 a.m.   Matthew, you are right that most vitamins have the same supplements as prenatal vitamins.  It is often the amounts that are different so look at both things.  The folic acid is most important.  Regarding protein other than meat such as eggs, peanut butter, soy milk, yogurt and beans.  Often our preferences change with pregnancy so she may turn out to love milk during pregnancy.  Good luck.   mary @ Mayo       June 21, 2011 6:38 p.m.   Hi Mary,  My wife and I are in the planning stages of her pregnancy. I'm trying to figure out the best pre-natal vitamins for her. I've noticed that many multi-vitamins have the same supplements as the pre-natals, plus additional vitamins and minerals. Should she be taking both? One over the other? Another wrinkle, she does not really eat meat ever (not a vegetarian, just doesn't like meat) and I've never seen her drink milk. What should I do to make sure she's getting optimal nutrition leading up the pregnancy? I admit, I will over-obsess about this, but hey, that's my job as her husband. Any advice you have would be much appreciated! Thank you very much.   Matthew       June 6, 2011 8:45 a.m.   Sheena, the current recommendations for folic acid is 400-800mcg a day.  I think you can take 2 tablets of 400mcg a day if you would like. Mary-Ann, you should be taking a prenatal supplement every day.

Nelson, R.D., L.D.   January 5, 2016         Longer winter evenings lend themselves to a bit more time at the dinner table. I have fond memories of family dinners when we went around the table with everyone sharing jokes and trivia  and even an occasional confessionary tale.   Here are a few food-related trivia questions that have come up over the years at my family's table:     What's the difference between shrimp and prawn?  Prawns are larger in size and have larger legs with claws on three pairs. Shrimp are smaller and have shorter legs with claws only on two pairs. However, the terms are often used interchangeably, with regional variations. For example, the term ""shrimp"" is used mostly in the U.S., whereas the term ""prawn"" is more common in Europe. In the U.S., the term ""prawn"" may carry the meaning that the shrimp is actually larger in size.   Is it safer to eat raw oysters in months that contain the letter ""r""?  No. At any time of year, raw oysters may contain the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus  which can be life-threatening, even fatal when eaten by people with liver disease or diabetes, pregnant women or individuals with weakened immune systems. While V. vulnificus are found in higher numbers in oysters during warm months, 40 percent of cases of food poisoning from this bacteria occur during colder months (September through April).   What makes chili peppers hot?  The compound responsible for the heat in chili peppers is capsaicin. It's found mainly in the seeds and inner ribs of the pepper, so take care when cutting up peppers. Capsaicin binds to pain receptors in the mouth and skin. Contrary to common belief, water won't put out the burn. Capsaicin is not water-soluble. Instead, reach for oil or detergent to scrub your hands  the oil or detergent will dissolve and wash away the capsaicin. To cool your mouth, drink a glass of milk. The casein proteins in milk act in a similar way and will ease the pain.   Can you cook without heat?  Yes. Tender protein foods such as fish or shellfish may be cooked by soaking in acidic juice or vinegar. This method of chemically cooking the fish tenderizes the protein like heat does. It's thought that this method of cooking originated in ancient Peru, where the fish dish called ceviche is a classic. Be aware, however, that this method does not ensure that harmful bacteria and parasites that can cause food poisoning are destroyed.     Share a few of your food musings. I'm always on the lookout for new ones.   Jennifer       With      Jennifer K.

What we do at our dinner table is make jokes and do funny things just to make each other laugh and have good time! Occasionally we will have a conversation about things that are going on in the world like political news etc. Mostly we just make jokes about things we've seen the past week or show someone a video of a cat falling into a box! Even though we do like to have fun at the table we always say our grace before we eat at the table! Thats should mostly cover all of the ""traditions"" we usually partake in at the dinner table!

Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   May 14, 2013          Juicing fruits and vegetables has become popular among health and fitness buffs. However, some people must juice  or blend  foods because they have medical problems that prevent them from eating solid foods. These problems may include tooth extraction or jaw trauma, diseases, cancer treatment, or obstructions or surgeries that inhibit chewing, swallowing, digesting and absorbing solid foods.      If you're following a liquefied diet because of a medical problems, consult your physician or a registered dietitian about what foods you can and can't have. In some cases, commercially prepared liquid meal replacements may be indicated.      Here are some key points to remember for safe juicing and blending:       Nutritional completeness . If you're relying on liquified foods in place of meals, you need to ensure that what you're drinking replaces those meals nutritionally. This is especially true when you have a medical condition that changes your nutritional needs. The longer you need to follow a liquid diet, the more importance it is that what you juice or blend is nutritionally sound.   Food safety . Make sure that everything you juice or blend is free from contamination. Raw vegetables and fresh fruit should be cleaned or precooked. Meats, poultry and fish should be cooked to proper temperatures before blending. Very young children, pregnant women, older adults and those with medical problems that weaken the immune systems are at the most risk for food poisoning. They should avoid unpasteurized milk and juices, raw eggs (eggs pasteurized in the shell are OK), and raw meat, fish and poultry. Some medical conditions, such as cancer or organ transplant, will require more stringent food restrictions.   Equipment . The ideal juicer or blender will include the pulp for consumption. Equipment should be easy to clean. Bits and grits of lodged food will grow bacteria. Ideally the equipment can go into a dishwasher for sanitizing, or be easily scrubbed.   Quantity . Blend only what you can consume at one meal. If you make more, refrigerate what you don't consume in clean covered containers. Use within 24 hours or discard.   Technique . Fill the juicer or blender only one-third to one-half full and process on low speed to prevent overflow. Important: Hot foods cause steam. Hot splashes may come through the feeder slot  or the lid may lift off. Vent the lid or feeder slot to allow steam to escape  cover the space with a clean towel to protect your hands from splashes.      - Jennifer         With      Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.

I love healthy juice recipe and wanted to share a simple kale recipe on my blog: https://www.bidsbypros.com/portal/kale-a-fashionable-and-trendy-super-food-among-the-elite/ Thanks for the opportunity and great read.   Don       May 24, 2013 12:39 a.m.   I started to juice in late Feb. At first just replacing one meal then after 1 month, replaced lunch or dinner with a juice drink. I usually used 1/2 greens e.g. Kale and half a mix of fruits and added some nuts or seeds for protein. To my surprise, in May when I had my fasting sugar and cholesterol checked my AIC was 5.9% and cholesterol went from 248 to 204! Lower than I've been in 30 years.    Mary       May 23, 2013 9:20 p.m.   I pureed food for myself when I had mouth and throat sores during chemotherapy. I pureed meat and potatoes with buttermilk. I did vegetables the same way but separately. You can try mashing pancakes with syrup...they really don't come out that well. Cereals I liked, I soaked in milk then pureed as needed. I generally switched to oatmeal. Yogurt and fruit puree nicely as you know.Good Luck   Dee       May 23, 2013 1:04 p.m.   Henry:  I have heard that a small amount of cyanide (such as in apple seeds) is actually good for you and may help with the prevention of cancer.   rochanah       May 22, 2013 4:00 p.m.   My mother needs a pureed, but not completely liquid, diet due to Parkinson's. For that, a food processor works best, because it is more powerful than a typical blender. One meal example is a puree of cooked chicken, mixed with mashed potatoes, and thinned with half and half.(I do the cooking/pureeing) I hope you do an article about pureed diets in the future. I still haven't figured out how to make things, like pancakes/waffles, edible.   jOHN       May 22, 2013 12:00 p.m.   What about apple seeds? I learned only recently that blended apple seeds might release cyanide. This was horrifying to learn. I'd been blending whole seeded apples for several years.

Phosphate is the drug form (salt) of phosphorus. Some phosphates are used to make the urine more acid, which helps treat certain urinary tract infections. Some phosphates are used to prevent the formation of calcium stones in the urinary tract.   Injectable phosphates are to be administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Some of these oral preparations are available only with a prescription. Others are available without a prescription; however, your health care professional may have special instructions on the proper dose of this medicine for your medical condition. You should take phosphates only under the supervision of your health care professional.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   The best dietary sources of phosphorus include dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and cereal products.   The daily amount of phosphorus needed is defined in several different ways.    For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Folic acid (vitamin B 9) is necessary for strong blood.   Lack of folic acid may lead to anemia (weak blood). Your health care professional may treat this by prescribing folic acid for you.   Some conditions may increase your need for folic acid. These include:      Alcoholism     Anemia, hemolytic     Diarrhea (continuing)     Fever (prolonged)     Hemodialysis     Illness (prolonged)     Intestinal diseases     Liver disease     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach      In addition, infants smaller than normal, breast-fed infants, or those receiving unfortified formulas (such as evaporated milk or goat's milk) may need additional folic acid.   Increased need for folic acid should be determined by your health care professional.   Some studies have found that folic acid taken by women before they become pregnant and during early pregnancy may reduce the chances of certain birth defects (neural tube defects).   Claims that folic acid and other B vitamins are effective for preventing mental problems have not been proven. Many of these treatments involve large and expensive amounts of vitamins.   Injectable folic acid is given by or under the direction of your health care professional. Another form of folic acid is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Folic acid is found in various foods, including vegetables, especially green vegetables; potatoes; cereal and cereal products; fruits; and organ meats (for example, liver or kidney). It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins. For example, heat may reduce the amount of folic acid in foods.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of folic acid needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).

For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.

The body needs iodine for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough iodine in their regular diet or who have a need for more iodine, sodium iodide may be necessary. Iodine is needed so that your thyroid gland can function properly.   Iodine deficiency in the United States is rare because iodine is added to table salt. Most people get enough salt from the foods they eat, without adding salt to their meals. Iodine deficiency is a problem in other areas of the world.   Lack of iodine may lead to thyroid problems, mental problems, hearing loss, and goiter.   Injectable sodium iodide is administered only by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Some multivitamin/mineral preparations that contain sodium iodide are available without your health care professional's prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Iodine is found in various foods, including seafood, small amounts of iodized salt, and vegetables grown in iodine-rich soils. Iodine-containing mist from the ocean is another important source of iodine, since iodine is absorbed by the skin. Iodized salt provides 76 micrograms (mcg) of iodine per gram of salt.   The daily amount of iodine needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons.

Although a balanced diet usually supplies all the magnesium a person needs, magnesium supplements may be needed by patients who have lost magnesium because of illness or treatment with certain medicines.   Lack of magnesium may lead to irritability, muscle weakness, and irregular heartbeat.   Injectable magnesium is given only by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Some oral magnesium preparations are available only with a prescription. Others are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   The best dietary sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, nuts, peas, beans, and cereal grains in which the germ or outer layers have not been removed. Hard water has been found to contain more magnesium than soft water. A diet high in fat may cause less magnesium to be absorbed. Cooking may decrease the magnesium content of food.   The daily amount of magnesium needed is defined in several different ways.    For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) is needed to help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It also makes it possible for oxygen to be used by your body.   Lack of riboflavin may lead to itching and burning eyes, sensitivity of eyes to light, sore tongue, itching and peeling skin on the nose and scrotum, and sores in the mouth. Your doctor may treat this condition by prescribing riboflavin for you.   Some conditions may increase your need for riboflavin.

Increased need for riboflavin should be determined by your health care professional.   Claims that riboflavin is effective for treatment of acne, some kinds of anemia (weak blood), migraine headaches, and muscle cramps have not been proven.   Oral forms of riboflavin are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet.

It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins, although little riboflavin is lost from foods during ordinary cooking.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of riboflavin needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes for riboflavin are generally defined as follows:   Information about this riboflavin-oral-route   Persons   U.S.  (mg)   Canada  (mg)     Infants and children   Birth to 3 years of age   0.40.8   0.30.7     4 to 6 years of age   1.1   0.9     7 to 10 years of age   1.2   11.3     Adolescent and adult males   1.41.8   11.6     Adolescent and adult females   1.21.3   11.1     Pregnant females   1.6   1.11.4     Breast-feeding females   1.71.8   1.41.5     This product is available in the following dosage forms:     Capsule   Tablet   Tablet, Enteric Coated       Before Using   Portions of this document last updated:  March 01, 2017   Copyright  2017 Truven Health Analytics Inc.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Thiamine (vitamin B 1) is needed for the breakdown of carbohydrates.   Some conditions may increase your need for thiamine. These include:      Alcoholism     Burns     Diarrhea (continuing)     Fever (continuing)     Illness (continuing)     Intestinal disease     Liver disease     Overactive thyroid     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach      Also, the following groups of people may have a deficiency of thiamine:      Patients using an artificial kidney (on hemodialysis)     Individuals who do heavy manual labor on a daily basis      Increased need for thiamine should be determined by your health care professional.   Lack of thiamine may lead to a condition called beriberi. Signs of beriberi include loss of appetite, constipation, muscle weakness, pain or tingling in arms or legs, and possible swelling of feet or lower legs. In addition, if severe, lack of thiamine may cause mental depression, memory problems, weakness, shortness of breath, and fast heartbeat. Your health care professional may treat this by prescribing thiamine for you.   Thiamine may also be used for other conditions as determined by your health care professional.   Claims that thiamine is effective for treatment of skin problems, chronic diarrhea, tiredness, mental problems, multiple sclerosis, nerve problems, and ulcerative colitis (a disease of the intestines), or as an insect repellant or to stimulate appetite have not been proven.   Injectable thiamine is administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Other forms of thiamine are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Thiamine is found in various foods, including cereals (whole-grain and enriched), peas, beans, nuts, and meats (especially pork and beef). Some thiamine in foods is lost with cooking.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat.

The body needs zinc for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough zinc in their regular diet or who have a need for more zinc, zinc supplements may be necessary. They are generally taken by mouth but some patients may have to receive them by injection.   Zinc supplements may be used for other conditions as determined by your health care professional.   Lack of zinc may lead to poor night vision and wound-healing, a decrease in sense of taste and smell, a reduced ability to fight infections, and poor development of reproductive organs.

Increased need for zinc should be determined by your health care professional.   Claims that zinc is effective in preventing vision loss in the elderly have not been proven. Zinc has not been proven effective in the treatment of porphyria.   Injectable zinc is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms of zinc are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Zinc is found in various foods, including lean red meats, seafood (especially herring and oysters), peas, and beans. Zinc is also found in whole grains; however, large amounts of whole-grains have been found to decrease the amount of zinc that is absorbed. Additional zinc may be added to the diet through treated (galvanized) cookware. Foods stored in uncoated tin cans may cause less zinc to be available for absorption from food.   The daily amount of zinc needed is defined in several different ways.

By  Jennifer K. Nelson, R.D., L.D.  and  Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D.   March 6, 2008          Do you take a multivitamin? Or a single vitamin, mineral, or combination supplement? If so, you are in the company of tens of millions of U.S. adults.      Why do you take them? Most people say it makes them feel healthier or they believe it will prevent chronic diseases, or colds and flu. But you may be surprised to know that what is in your bottle and on the label is not strictly regulated. And there is no system in place to collect reports of adverse affects.      Over the past few years there has been increasing evidence that multivitamins and single or combination type vitamin/mineral supplements may not provide the health benefit sought by you, the consumer. In some cases the opposite or no beneficial effects have been reported.      Alarming to think that vitamin or mineral supplements could actually cause more harm than good. An example of this is the use of beta carotene by smokers actually increased the incidence of lung cancer. This is echoed by a recent study out of the University of Washington that reports the use of multivitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E and folate did not reduce the risk of lung cancer.      It is not all bad news though; there are studies to support the use of folate (folic acid) prior to and during pregnancy in the prevention of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. And history has proven that vitamins and minerals play a critical role in our health  the reason we know about the benefits of vitamins and minerals in food is because of the major discoveries in disease prevention such as vitamin C and scurvy and thiamine, a B vitamin, and beri beri (a wasting type disease).      This may leave you wondering if those vitamin mineral supplements in your medicine cabinet are doing what they should or even worth your money.      Let's look at this way  do you eat a well balanced diet? If so, you may not need a multivitamin and if you take one as a ""safety net"" know that you may exceed what your body needs or can use.      Are you concerned about a chronic disease? If so, making changes in your diet and exercise habits, not smoking and following through with recommended screenings by your physician are more likely to benefit your overall health picture.      Consider your current state of health, talk to your doctor and/or dietitian, and weigh the possible benefits and risks of a multivitamin and mineral supplement for you.

Seems like a pretty straight forward study and would benefit mankind more that a significant amount of research being conducted......  Is it effective?  TAKE VITAMIN X   ====> YES NO TAKE VITAMIN Y   ====> YES NO   and how effective is it vs obsessing over a perfect diet.   John H.

Charles Kendall       July 7, 2016 4:33 p.m.   The Cochran report shows that taking vitamin supplements has no benefit at all. Some, under certain circumstances, may, as you note above, cause harm.   Morton Bodanis       January 30, 2016 8:38 p.m.   I'm on 1200 calorie diet and no way possible to consume 3600mg of potassium per day, I'm lucky if I hit half that level. So what does one do.

Then I started losing my weight, not right away thou go's on quick harder to take off.  But there must be one that does'nt cause weight gain. I really think I should take 1 w/no weight gain.  Thats my opinion thou. Would love to hear your comments women over ""50"" (I'm ""54"") can't wait!!

The vitamins which are promoted  for good health contsin...hydogenated palm oil.... There has been so much information about hydrogenated oils and that they are not good for you. And here it is...in a daily vitamin!!  Since most processed food have removed it from their products, here it is in vitamins !  Not many people read the tiny print , especially seniors whose eyesight may not be good. I know it couldnt be much in one vitamin, but it should not be there at all. Just thought I would comment on this becaue I woulkd lke more people to know about this.  thank you,  Catherine Chase  Love your web site,,very helpful!   Catherine Chase       February 1, 2014 11:05 p.m.   There are many differences between brands of vitamins, such as they way they are processed and grown. Yes, vitamins can be pricey and ineffective. It all depends on how your body processes vitamins and minerals. Everyone's body is different, same with their lifestyles. So to say that multivitamins/vitamins on their own are ineffective is very vague. I have been taking Nutrilite Double X for about 10 days now and am feeling great. I had a very poor immune system due to antibiotics and other illnesses.   Mike       January 4, 2014 1:44 a.m.   I stopped taking multivitaments for 6 weeks now, but i feel not the same, tired and no appetied   Annet van Dorsser       October 2, 2013 11:12 a.m.   Can some smart person like Matt --with whom I concur on the use of vitamins-- tell me  -can a preschooler get a sore tongue and fungus-like conditions from eating tooo much fruit?  This is a serious query.  I await a response.  Jody   Jody       July 11, 2013 3:35 p.m.   Besides the fact that vitamin supplements are not regulated, then add the fact that synthetic vitamin supplements have NEVER been proven to be effective by anyone or too anyone(you'd think that if they were effective a lab could prove it in this day and age)I will bow out and use my common sense to just eat a well balanced diet(and use the money I save on all the pills for a nice vacation). I refuse to be &quot;conditioned&quot; by all the hype and marketing $$$ and refuse to follow the &quot;sheep&quot;.  Baaah!     Skeptic       June 24, 2013 2:06 p.m.   This article doesn't really address the complexities surrounding this issue. There are many different vitamins on the market, all of which have varying percentages of the daily recommended values for various vitamins and minerals. Also, the issue of whether or not there is a significant difference between synthetic vitamins and vitamins derived from whole foods is not addressed. The studies mentioned in this article are not very relevant. The fact that smokers developed lung cancer at a slightly higher rate isn't really much of a relevant result for non smokers. Also, the fact that vitamins don't reduce the risk of cancer in one study doesn't really speak to other potential benefits, or risks. I'm going to look for an all natural multivitamin without excessive daily values and I may just take it every other day. I'll keep exercising and I'll try to eat a little bit healthier. Everything in moderation I guess.    Matt       March 6, 2013 8:20 a.m.   A reliable way to gather hysterical nonsense is to consult public opinion on the subject of food.   Herbert       January 15, 2013 10:23 a.m.   Ohhhh, Nooo ! Alert the media ! &quot;In some cases&quot;. &quot;MAY not&quot;. Gasp ! Why isn't the TV news constantly warning us of this horrible threat to our health ? I'm 60, and I've been taking vitamin / mineral supplements, as what you call a safety net, since I was knee high. I admit,I can't run a marathon or lift 300 lbs over my head, but do I need to ? Modern physicians are 99 % pill-pushers for the drug manufacturers. Don't eat &quot;convenience food&quot;, get some exercise, and take a few of those &quot;safety nets&quot;. Thank you. Live long, and prosper.   Tom       January 15, 2013 3:41 a.m.   I am not sure why this article suggests to talk to your doctor or dietitian about the benefits and risks of taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement. Why on earth would I talk to a doctor who has absolutely no education or training in NUTRITION. Doctors are like the general public when it comes to nutrition they watch doctor oz and listen to advertising on television and eat foods full of MSG, aspartame, and genetically modified organisms all lovingly approved by the FDA, the supposed watchdog and gatekeeper of healthy food and drugs. Doctors are not trained in nutrition they are trained to hand out pharmaceutical synthetic drugs. Most doctors think vitamins and minerals are quackery....Well, I've got news for you, it is biochemistry. The body is powered by vitamins and minerals at a cellular level...not by drugs...drugs simply mask symptoms and temporarily give the patient the illusion of health, an illusion that Houdini couldn't even have pulled off...deaths attributed to prescription drugs used as directed conservative estimates are 106,000 per year. Vitamins and minerals don't even average 1 provable death...call the poison control center and get the numbers! This article is a sham. Talk to a biochemist if you want to know how your body works, not a doctor or dietitian. It has been proven that most of the symptoms mainstream medicine categorizes as disease is actually nutritional deficiencies or toxicity. You can't cure a nutritional deficiency with drugs.   Jason       January 3, 2013 10:23 p.m.   How long does the break between vitamin taking have to be? how many times I have to take vitamins in a year?    Alex       November 6, 2012 2:05 p.m.   I'm not sure the purpose of the article as it pertains to the description of Multi-Vitamins effectiveness on preventing disease. There has never been any statement by anyone, anywhere, at any time that taking vitamins can reduce the risk of lung cancer for smokers. It's absolutely absurd to plant the seed of doubt amongst a population that clearly cannot decide for itself how to eat properly (over 30% of Americans are overweight or obese), and tell them it might not be in their best interest to take a multivitamin. Sure, taking copious amounts of fat soluble vitamins and heavy metals are NOT ok, but vitamin C? There's this funny little blurb on the bottom of every vitamin bottle in the US that tells you its not meant to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, the F.D.A. forces them to put it on the bottle. So, to sum up the article, if I smoke, taking a multivitamin won't prevent lung cancer, got it, thanks. Think I'll keep taking my GNC multivitamin, while you check the validity of writing such an article, check back with you in 50 years when there is actual RESEARCH!   Sam       March 13, 2012 10:51 a.m.   Mary: Caffeine is not considered a vitamin, nor a mineral - nor is it considered an essential nutrient. So it doesn't necessarily enhance nutritional status. Caffeine is a stimulant, and evidence of its benefits/risks are conflicting. It is accepted that it increases alertness and may enhance athletic performance (depending on the sport). But in some people and in high enough doses it may have adverse effects (headache, anxiety, sleeplessness) and trigger heart beat irregularities. If you drink caffeinated beverages and take a supplement with caffeine, you may be getting more caffeine than your realize. Thanks for your question.   Jennifer Nelson       March 12, 2012 1:07 p.m.   Is caffeine good in a multivitamin? I was taking a multivitamin by Eniva called VIBE Cardiac &amp; Life, it contains 2.5 cups of caffeine out of 32 oz.  please respond.   Mary       December 31, 2011 7:21 p.m.   Everyone should do a little research on the lack of vitamins and minerals in our food.  Farming practices (certain fertilizers inhibit a plant's ability to absorb minerals from the ground), shipping (most fruits and vegetables ripen when they are not attached to the ground), processing, and packaging all contribute to a great decrease in the amount of vitamins and minerals that actually make it into our bodies.  When you add to this that the standard American diet is FAR from being &quot;well balanced&quot;, (remember, they call it &quot;standard&quot; because that is the way most of us eat), most of us need to get more vitamins and minerals. I have recently started taking a vitamin and mineral supplement and I feel better and have more energy. I will never stop.    Greg       May 5, 2011 6:02 p.m.   Need your help.  Read your comments on multi-vitamins.  Was helpful, but much more helpful if you recommended a handful that met your requirements.  There are so many products out there, that some real guidance would have been more meaningful   Larry       March 16, 2011 1:24 p.m.   I came across this Mayo article in the middle of reading the vitamin and supplements chapter in &quot;Denialism.&quot;  All right, I looked for it because of what I read.  The problem is largely anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot; against facts.  Unfortuantely Mayo gives us few of the latter.  Do read &quot;Denialism&quot; if you care what you put in your body, and for good measure &quot;White Coat, Black Hat&quot; and &quot;Our Daily Meds&quot; for the same reason.  I'm 76, a survivor of prostate and bladder cancers and down to just a multivitamin with full support of my docs.   Next annual appointment I'll ask about dumping the vitamins and enjoying my healthy diet even more.  Eat well, join the Y.       Ron       October 3, 2010 1:52 p.m.   This article makes no sense.  I'm going to recommend everyone stick with the standard thing: eat a healthy, balanced diet, and get your vitamins that way.  Taking a basic vitamin/general supplement can help supplement anything extra you're missing, but don't use it to try and fix a bad diet.   Matt       September 17, 2010 12:15 p.m.   all this is very confusing for someone who wants to know whether taking food supplements is beneficial or not.  I guess that in the contemporary health care no advice is unanimously agreed upon... and people's comments make it even more confusing!   Toufic       June 13, 2010 2:47 p.m.   I know some people who sell Amway and they take a large amount of supplements (at least 20 different ones) they also propose an energy drink from that business that is loaded with B vitamins they say is needed by an elderly alzheimers relative. the energy drink is also caffeinated and they say the alzheimers patient should drink 4 per day.  It doesn't make sense to me and also I think they are trying to make money off this alzheimers patient.  They also have him taking ginko, Q10, Omega, Perfect Water, and a multi vitamin.  Do you think this 80 year old alzheimers patient needs this, or do you think someone is selling Amway to just make money?   Judy       March 31, 2010 8:57 p.m.    There is a great deal of information out there, it would be nice if we followed a more 'European' model and applauded the help these things (vitamins and herbal supplements) offer many people. Perhaps creating some jobs regulating purity and consistent dosage in the industry, but letting people decide what to put in their own bodies.Check out Pub Med,  medlineplus, and other reputable websites, many libraries have well documented books of drug interactions and herbal preparations and vitamin information.. they can also help direct you to a reputable source for such information.    Medical  educational institutions need to embrace the helpfulness of these items and respect the differences of each persons  body. Partner to help find out what works, don't condemn. There is data out there on how many persons use these things (and swear by them) yet don't tell their doctors due a perceived disrespect for their choices.....better we should all be dedicated to what works  (get a good medical librarian, demand courses at medical schools, make sure you seem open minded to your patients and demand that testing on vitamins and herbal preparations be conducted). I  think the 'horse is already out of the barn'.    Marena       March 31, 2010 8:21 a.m.   What the body does not need can be eliminated.  Trust in the wisdom of the body - flesh is not dumb.  And results have proven that treatment of desease with so-called mega vitamin therapy is an excellent modality.  Now the question is:  When is the Mayo Clinic coming on board an Orthomolecular Chair?   Sally       March 23, 2010 8:58 a.m.   I am a 68 yo female. Eat a healthy diet, exercise and maintain a normal weight. Never smoked, seldom drink. Taken a multi-vitamin daily since a young child. After reading your e-mail I discontinued my multiple vitamin and I have had more energy, slept better and feel wonderful. Also, there has been a royal blue ring in my toilet for months. After discontinuing the multiple vitamin, it has disappeared--pretty expensive urine I think!   Doris       March 19, 2010 2:09 p.m.   I was taking extra vitamin C along with juices that had up to 130% of the daily recommended dosage and my iron levels became worringly high.     Romeo       March 19, 2010 7:01 a.m.   You people, and the medical community in general, are ready to sound alarms, suggest dire possibilities but unwilling (unable) to offer useful directions. How about some firm suggestions supported by data. Surely there have been studies on the efficacy of multivitamins and other supplements. Yes?   Bob       March 18, 2010 12:00 p.m.   I've been taking a multivitamin, 500 mg vitamin &quot;C&quot;, &quot;B&quot; complex vitamins; and calcium with &quot;D&quot; for years.  I was told vitamins &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are stored in your body so be careful not to take more than your body needs daily.  &quot;B&quot; vitamins are water soluble and are eliminated by your body daily.  Vitamin &quot;C&quot; is also water soluble.  Read your labels carefully.  Produce that is shipped:  how many vitamins are left after sitting on trucks and in a wharehouse for days?  By the time it gets to a supermarket the vitamins are gone.  The trick is to buy from your local farm when available.  During the winter months I buy frozen vegetables and feel they are better than so called &quot;fresh.&quot;   Bea       March 17, 2010 7:06 p.m.   I find My HMO Drs never agree that my Conditions (Side effects)  caused by  for  Example 40mg Omeprazole Caused Rapid Heart Beat after about being on them for 2 months had to be admitted to ER and ICU to bring pulse  back to Normal.Later I read the Lit given to me when I got the Med and there it was--Rapid Heart Beat as psbl Side Effect I called my Dr and he did not agree w/me that that was the Cause.About 3 weeks ago started getting severe Stomach Cramps and Vomitting - called Dr said if continues got to Urgent care and take Maalox never mentioned it could be the Omeprazole.I called Pharmacist my Symptoms listed as #1 complaint called my Gastro DR (I have Ulcers)he also did not agree it was the Omeprazole.Im about to give up on asking Drs -  best to call your Pharmacist and t/w your Cab Driver. My Cab Driver told me he has been drinking Aloe Vera Juice for Ulcers and Digestive health for years and no more Stomach Distress.  Went to Wall Mart bought a Gallon of Pure Aloe Vera - no sugar cut down to only 1 cap of Omeprazole and started w/4 oz of the juice in the morning or sip throughout the day as I do not like the taste but guess what it works I feel much better watch what I eat but found I can eat a Hamburger and or a spicy Burritto and no problem - have to be careful though and dont stuff myself.(Been on Aloe Vera Juice about 1 week now) Also found out some Mexican Super Mkts have the Aloe Vera Gel Or plant and you can peel it and Dice and eat like A Salad.   Benny Sr       March 17, 2010 6:50 p.m.   Alarm! Alarm! But no facts or information of substance.   Ron       March 17, 2010 12:27 p.m.   In my 20's I was a skinny malnourished woman working full time but always tired and irritable.  Late 20's started taking multiple vitamins/minerals, gained to normal weight and felt 100% better.  Enabled me to continue working to age 65.  I'm now 74 and still living independently, driving, shopping, etc. and feel and look great!  I highly recommend taking the recommended doses of vitamins for all ages.  (Your body will eliminate anything you ingest not needed.)   Jean       March 17, 2010 8:04 a.m.   I currently take a daily multivitamin, 3 Niacin caps and nine (9) 1000mg Fish oil caps daily as prescribed by my Cardiologist!  My previously elevated LDL cholestorel levels have dropped like a rock and are now normal.  My HDL levels have risen to normal.  After diagnosis of Stage 3 Folicular Lymphoma in 2003 and taking 8 rounds of Chemo (Retuxan Chop), having a heart attack in 2006 and undergoing Angioplasty and Stent implantation I can say without a doubt that taking supplements along with modifying my diet and walking has improved my health 100% and at 47 y/o I have never felt better in my life.  My suggestion is to talk to your Primary Care Physician before starting any aggressive vitamin regimen but don't count out taking supplements as part of your daily overall health improvement plan.  Do everything in moderation including vitamins, diet and exercise.  Moderation and consistency are the keys to success in keeping healthy and staying out of the hospital.  And most importantly staying alive for those we love!   Mark       March 17, 2010 6:53 a.m.   Ooo, you hit a hot button there.  With all the meds that are pushed at us in this country with little or no advice for life style changes, you're telling us to beware of supplements?!!!    Survivor       March 17, 2010 1:53 a.m.   Well,i think multivitamins are helpful they have been here since long.We need to have some kind of moderation as my mother says excess of evrything is bad.   mrinal       March 16, 2010 11:33 p.m.   I've worked in medical research settings for many years and I haven't met any physicians who know much about nutrition--or are at all interested.  As for &quot;well-balanced diets&quot;, this thread-bare phrase should be put to rest.  Supplements: There is so much advertising hype, and the scent of money attracts some professionals who probably know better.  I take supplements and use some alternative medical treatments, but I read as much as I can about what I am doing.  Good luck!  You'll need it.   Norm       March 16, 2010 10:38 p.m.   Beta carotene are bad for smokers? My boyfriend smokes a ton and likes making carrot juice. This is bad?   Alexandra       March 16, 2010 10:10 p.m.   You lost me when your fist argument stated that lack of regulation means we should all be wary of supplements. I am much more wary of the pharmaceuticals that the FDA DOES regulate, which cause more mortality and adverse side effects than any vitamin. What's so outrageous is that this type of rhetoric/scare tactic still persists in the medical community, even though many comments have pointed out the obvious flaw in this rhetoric.    Kathleen       March 16, 2010 6:31 p.m.   Possibly the vitamins and supplements do not do all that we hope for.  But what about prescription drugs which are ?regulated? and the list of warnings given on those regulated drugs?  Frankly, I will continue to use my vitamins and supplements and avoid the prescription regulated ones!!!!!   Florence       March 16, 2010 4:08 p.m.   It seems to me that the 'attacks' against using supplements are based on two main points: 1. That the quality/predictability of the vitamin or mineral may very from manufacturer to manufacturer. To which I say: a. I guess if you buy your vitamins at a 5 &amp; 10 cent store, expect to buy cheap products. Good companies would tend to be more predictable and dependable. b. The foods we buy at the stores would and do suffer from the same lack of dependability, as to freshness, vitality, etc. Which speaks to the sense of trying supplementation. 2. Balanced diet is the answer. What planet is this recommendation for? With greens coming from Mexico and fruits from Argentina and U. S. products heavy with unknown additives -- I mean let's get real. 3. Oh - one other 'attack' is the fear of what nutrients can do when encountering situations in our bodies... e.g. pregnancy, other drug interactions, etc. This is fear-based rhetoric. If taken seriously - -who checks what an Ibuprofen does when entering a body of a pregnant woman also taking pre-natal supplements and high blood pressure Rx? So much rhetoric -- so little real world... Reasonable supplements are health insurance premiums against the risk of life as we know it.    Tom       January 29, 2010 11:55 a.m.   To FRANK H. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU BOUGHT YOUR SUPPLEMENT in Europe.  Anything that dissolves in water will be absorbed so much better than tablets. Please                        ***FRANK H. ***IF YOU ARE HERE, PLEASE HELP ME FIND SOME GOOD SUPPLEMENTS.  Or if anyone else can help me out, I thank you in advance.     Sue       January 28, 2010 2:42 p.m.   I'm 80 yrs old - I do all my own housework, laundray, shopping and still drive.  I never get colds or have I ever had a flu shot!  I take a mulltiple vitamin, extra D3 and B6 plus Omega 3.  Heck!  I'm gonna die anyway!   Pat       December 10, 2009 6:34 p.m.   I have been taking a multivitamin that I purchased from Europe. The multivitamin contains the 12 essential vitamins our body needs at 100% of each of their values. I can honestly tell you that I have never felt better since taking this tablet. It desolves in water and tastes great. Why doesn't this product exist in this county? We don't get enough vitamins our body needs in the processed foods found in the States. My energy and mind are clearer and last the day long. I'm not tired, sore or achy.     Frank H       December 7, 2009 8:38 p.m.   My husband was told by a surgeon that I should loose weight.   That I'm at 25% mortality rate right now.  What does he mean by this.   I am extremely obesed.  My bmi is 87.5     cheyene       September 8, 2009 12:18 a.m.   The study in Nutrition Journal  ( http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/30 ) noted by Toni merely says that people who take vitamins have more vitamins in their bloodstream.  If you read the article, you'll see that the so-called &quot;biomarkers&quot; they found in supplement users' blood are the vitamins themselves.  The article says nothing about &quot;better health&quot; of supplement users, except certain cases of self-assessed health that were not statistically significant. The article comes to no clear or strong conclusion about anything, really. This doesn't mean that supplements are useless, but rather that the long-term data show unclear results.   Howard       February 21, 2009 9:25 p.m.   Since we have a hand-free axes to by any kind of nutrition supplements in a market, chances are that we can harm our self much easier than helping our self. In the old countries, where these opportunities do not exist, people eat less but natural food and live longer, happier and active life. In modernized countries, we look for supplements to move us from couch. If is for me ,brothers and sisters; boil and don't broil- even the oil(don't fry). Never fill your stomack in full. Vitamins in morning- minerals in evening and high protein- the last after meal, followed by cold water drink. No starch, no sugar- if you want to live longer. Today stay away from the food which bothered you yesterday. If your tongue is white in morning - you ate bad food in evening. TO BEFIT DOCTORS AND NUTRITION CORPORATES -JUST IGNORE MY COMMENTS. TO BENEFIT YOUR SELF, LIVE THOSE SULFATES IN THEIR SHELFS. Se you in a great health!   luigi       July 26, 2008 6:13 p.m.   I don't believe in a so called healthy diet,overcooking,processing,pesticdes,the  list goes on,but all add to getting little or no benefits from any vitamin content contained in food,better a multivitamin if in doubt ask at any reputable health shop,most medical professionals frown upon supplements,saying that a balanced diet is better for you,it,s too difficult in this day and age to get this,most  people opt for quick meals,fast foods, which have little or no vitamins in them you could never assess exactly what you get from food properly in any case.   stuart fraser       July 14, 2008 11:33 a.m.   I have an excess of iron and calcium detected from blood tests - what causes this and how is it treated?   Cindy       May 2, 2008 6:13 a.m.   I BELIEVED THAT SOME MULTIVITAMINS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE,BASSED ON YOUR RESEACH, CAN YOU OUTLINE THOSE MULTIVITAMINE THAT ARE EFFECTIVE TO HUMAN HEALTH?.      GERALD       March 30, 2008 8:58 p.m.   Check out the Landmark Study in Nutrition Journal, an online, peer-reviewed international human nutrition journal. The study, entitled Usage Patterns, Health, and Nutritional Status of Long-Term Multiple Dietary Supplement Users, is the first-ever study on long-term users of multiple dietary supplements, and found these users comparatively to have markedly better health as measured by higher blood levels of key nutrients and more optimal levels of key health biomarkers. This simply confirms that long-term consumers of specific whole food supplements have better health than the two comparison groupsthose who used just a multivitamin and those who use no supplements at all.  Publication of the Landmark study in Nutrition Journal ensures free and universal access to the manuscript thus enabling immediate communication of these important Landmark study research findings to and from virtually any place in the world. The study will also be indexed in PubMed Central, a free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature published by the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ensuring broad based availability of the study manuscript.  This publication offers incredible support and enhancement to scientific credibility.  If anyone would like a copy, I would be happy to send one.   To the best of health, Antoinette   Toni       March 26, 2008 3:34 p.m.   I don't know why anyone feels the need to cite the beta carotene study regarding smokers.If a person smokes they shouldn't expect any results from supplements because they shouldn't be smoking and talking about health in the same sentence. Nothing good comes from smoking and the havoc it causes to every system of the body. Beta carotene is not bad but in a smokers body it might be- but that's because they smoke!! Most americans are fat, stressed out and unhealthy and could certainly use a multivitamin not to mention a few other supplements.    Karen       March 26, 2008 8:36 a.m.   Seriously, who wants to take another pill or more? Natural forms of vitamins in minerals found in food work much better with one another than taking isolated forms of vitamins and minerals. For good health we all should be eating balanced meals most of the time. That way we do get the right amount of vitamins and minerals that our bodies need. Of course there are specific cases when people who are truly deficient of a certain vitamin and/or mineral with need to use supplements.   Susie       March 18, 2008 1:53 p.m.   &quot;'You're obviously being paid by the &quot;sickness industry&quot; and not the &quot;wellness industry.&quot; -End of Comment'&quot;   Wow, Tim. You seem to be a rather unscientific thinker. I for one am glad that people with real expertise on nutrition (dieticians) are willing to put out unbiased, scientifically valid advice like this for us.   As for not promoting &quot;wellness,&quot; do you not think that citing the evidence that supports the potential harm of supplements is done in the name of promoting wellness?   The careful methods of science have done more for human wellness than anything else I can think of.     rob       March 14, 2008 8:28 p.m.   I take Vibe, a liquid supplement, for vitamins and antioxidants, and Efacor for Omega3s every day, and I am sure they do improve my overall health.   Dave       March 12, 2008 10:52 a.m.   I am a 48 year old healthy, normal-weight woman.  My doctor recommends taking a multivitamin plus calcium supplements.  I find taking these pills leaves a lump in my stomach all day.  I do not take vitamins on an empty stomach, but they still bother me.  Any suggestions?  Can I crush the tablets up before taking them?  Can I just drink milk instead of taking the calcium tablets?  How much milk do I need?   Marie       March 11, 2008 8:35 p.m.   You're obviously being paid by the &quot;sickness industry&quot; and not the &quot;wellness industry.&quot; -End of Comment   Tim       March 11, 2008 6:11 p.m.   Perhaps in the medical world the training for supplements is vastly underestimated and therefore you have no formal training in actual supplementation. I happen  to know this for a fact because of my association with medical professionals, although I am not one myself. You would also be surprised to know that there is research from Harvard saying every adult needs to be taking at least a multivitamin. You are correct in saying that what vitamins claim to have in them is not &quot;strictly regulated.&quot;   Katie Carter       March 9, 2008 10:38 a.m.   London is beyond the 51st parallel and nobody who eats a reasonable diet here i short of Vitamin D.  I'm disappointed that the Mayo Clinic, of all places, isn't a bit more forthright in pointing out how much money is wasted on unnecessary supplements.   David Colquhoun       March 8, 2008 6:32 p.m.   I don't know if vitamins work or not.  But I can say that I have taken a mulitvitamine for many years, and am very rairly sick.   joanne       March 7, 2008 7:47 a.m.   You failed to mention Vit. D and the lack thereof especially north of the 40th parallel may be inadequate d/t lack of sun exposure several months of the year, using sun screen, and potentially underestimated RDA.

When the body does not get enough iron, it cannot produce the number of normal red blood cells needed to keep you in good health. This condition is called iron deficiency (iron shortage) or iron deficiency anemia.   Although many people in the U.S. get enough iron from their diet, some must take additional amounts to meet their needs. For example, iron is sometimes lost with slow or small amounts of bleeding in the body that you would not be aware of and which can only be detected by your doctor. Your doctor can determine if you have an iron deficiency, what is causing the deficiency, and if an iron supplement is necessary.   Lack of iron may lead to unusual tiredness, shortness of breath, a decrease in physical performance, and learning problems in children and adults, and may increase your chance of getting an infection.   Some conditions may increase your need for iron. These include:       Bleeding problems     Burns     Hemodialysis     Intestinal diseases     Stomach problems     Stomach removal     Use of medicines to increase your red blood cell count      In addition, infants, especially those receiving breast milk or low-iron formulas, may need additional iron.   Increased need for iron supplements should be determined by your health care professional.   Injectable iron is administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Other forms of iron are available without a prescription; however, your health care professional may have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your condition.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Iron is found in the diet in two formsheme iron, which is well absorbed, and nonheme iron, which is poorly absorbed. The best dietary source of absorbable (heme) iron is lean red meat. Chicken, turkey, and fish are also sources of iron, but they contain less than red meat. Cereals, beans, and some vegetables contain poorly absorbed (nonheme) iron. Foods rich in vitamin C (e.g., citrus fruits and fresh vegetables), eaten with small amounts of heme iron-containing foods, such as meat, may increase the amount of nonheme iron absorbed from cereals, beans, and other vegetables. Some foods (e.g., milk, eggs, spinach, fiber-containing, coffee, tea) may decrease the amount of nonheme iron absorbed from foods. Additional iron may be added to food from cooking in iron pots.   The daily amount of iron needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes in milligrams (mg) for iron are generally defined as follows (Note that the RDA and RNI are expressed as an actual amount of iron, which is referred to as elemental' iron.

They are needed in only small amounts and are available in the foods that you eat. Vitamin E prevents a chemical reaction called oxidation, which can sometimes result in harmful effects in your body. It is also important for the proper function of nerves and muscles.   Some conditions may increase your need for vitamin E. These include:      Intestine disease     Liver disease     Pancreas disease     Surgical removal of stomach      Increased need for vitamin E should be determined by your health care professional.   Infants who are receiving a formula that is not fortified with vitamin E may be likely to have a vitamin E deficiency. Also, diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids may increase your need for vitamin E.   Claims that vitamin E is effective for treatment of cancer and for prevention or treatment of acne, aging, loss of hair, bee stings, liver spots on the hands, bursitis, diaper rash, frostbite, stomach ulcer, heart attacks, labor pains, certain blood diseases, miscarriage, muscular dystrophy, poor posture, sexual impotence, sterility, infertility, menopause, sunburn, and lung damage from air pollution have not been proven. Although vitamin E is being used to prevent certain types of cancer, there is not enough information to show that this is effective.   Lack of vitamin E is extremely rare, except in people who have a disease in which it is not absorbed into the body.   Vitamin E is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Vitamin E is found in various foods including vegetable oils (corn, cottonseed, soybean, safflower), wheat germ, whole-grain cereals, and green leafy vegetables. Cooking and storage may destroy some of the vitamin E in foods.   Vitamin supplements alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods. For example, small amounts of fat are needed so that vitamin E can be absorbed into the body.   The daily amount of vitamin E needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Vitamin E is available in various forms, including d- or dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, d- or dl-alpha tocopherol, and d- or dl-alpha tocopheryl acid succinate. In the past, the RDA for vitamin E have been expressed in Units. This term has been replaced by alpha tocopherol equivalents (alpha-TE) or milligrams (mg) of d-alpha tocopherol. One Unit is equivalent to 1 mg of dl-alpha tocopherol acetate or 0.6 mg d-alpha tocopherol. Most products available in stores continue to be labeled in Units.   Normal daily recommended intakes in milligrams (mg) of alpha tocopherol equivalents (mg alpha-TE) and Units for vitamin E are generally defined as follows:   Information about this vitamin-e-oral-route   Persons   U.S.   Canada     mg  alpha-TE   Units   mg  alpha-TE   Units     Infants and children   Birth to 3 years of  age   36    510   34    56.7      4 to 6 years of age   7   11.7   5   8.3      7 to 10 years of age   7   11.7   68   1013      Adolescent and adult  males   10    16.7   610    1016.7      Adolescent and adult  females    8   13   57   8.311.7      Pregnant females    10   16.7   89   1315     Breast-feeding  females   1112    1820   910    1516.7      This product is available in the following dosage forms:     Liquid   Solution   Tablet   Capsule, Liquid Filled   Tablet, Chewable   Powder for Solution   Capsule       Before Using   Portions of this document last updated:  March 01, 2017   Copyright  2017 Truven Health Analytics Inc.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Ascorbic acid, also known as vitamin C, is necessary for wound healing. It is needed for many functions in the body, including helping the body use carbohydrates, fats, and protein. Vitamin C also strengthens blood vessel walls.   Lack of vitamin C can lead to a condition called scurvy, which causes muscle weakness, swollen and bleeding gums, loss of teeth, and bleeding under the skin, as well as tiredness and depression. Wounds also do not heal easily. Your health care professional may treat scurvy by prescribing vitamin C for you.   Some conditions may increase your need for vitamin C. These include:      AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)     Alcoholism     Burns     Cancer     Diarrhea (prolonged)     Fever (prolonged)     Infection (prolonged)     Intestinal diseases     Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)     Stomach ulcer     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach     Tuberculosis      Also, the following groups of people may have a deficiency of vitamin C:      Infants receiving unfortified formulas     Smokers     Patients using an artificial kidney (on hemodialysis)     Patients who undergo surgery     Individuals who are exposed to long periods of cold temperatures       Increased need for vitamin C should be determined by your health care professional.   Vitamin C may be used for other conditions as determined by your health care professional.   Claims that vitamin C is effective for preventing senility and the common cold, and for treating asthma, some mental problems, cancer, hardening of the arteries, allergies, eye ulcers, blood clots, gum disease, and pressure sores have not been proven. Although vitamin C is being used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer, there is not enough information to show that these uses are effective.   Injectable vitamin C is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms of vitamin C are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Vitamin C is found in various foods, including citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruit), green vegetables (peppers, broccoli, cabbage), tomatoes, and potatoes. It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins. For example, exposure to air, drying, salting, or cooking (especially in copper pots), mincing of fresh vegetables, or mashing potatoes may reduce the amount of vitamin C in foods. Freezing does not usually cause loss of vitamin C unless foods are stored for a very long time.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of vitamin C needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons.

They are needed in small amounts only and are available in the foods that you eat. Vitamin D is necessary for strong bones and teeth.   Lack of vitamin D may lead to a condition called rickets, especially in children, in which bones and teeth are weak. In adults it may cause a condition called osteomalacia, in which calcium is lost from bones so that they become weak. Your doctor may treat these problems by prescribing vitamin D for you. Vitamin D is also sometimes used to treat other diseases in which calcium is not used properly by the body.   Ergocalciferol is the form of vitamin D used in vitamin supplements.   Some conditions may increase your need for vitamin D. These include:       Alcoholism     Intestine diseases     Kidney disease     Liver disease     Overactivity of the parathyroid glands with kidney failure     Pancreas disease     Surgical removal of stomach      In addition, individuals and breast-fed infants who lack exposure to sunlight, as well as dark-skinned individuals, may be more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency. Increased need for vitamin D should be determined by your health care professional.   Alfacalcidol, calcifediol, calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol are forms of vitamin D used to treat hypocalcemia (not enough calcium in the blood). Alfacalcidol, calcifediol, and calcitriol are also used to treat certain types of bone disease that may occur with kidney disease in patients who are undergoing kidney dialysis.   Claims that vitamin D is effective for treatment of arthritis and prevention of nearsightedness or nerve problems have not been proven. Some psoriasis patients may benefit from vitamin D supplements; however, controlled studies have not been performed.   Injectable vitamin D is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Some strengths of ergocalciferol and all strengths of alfacalcidol, calcifediol, calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol are available only with your doctor's prescription. Other strengths of ergocalciferol are available without a prescription. However, it may be a good idea to check with your health care professional before taking vitamin D on your own. Taking large amounts over long periods may cause serious unwanted effects.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Vitamin D is found naturally only in fish and fish-liver oils. However, it is also found in milk (vitamin Dfortified). Cooking does not affect the vitamin D in foods. Vitamin D is sometimes called the ""sunshine vitamin"" since it is made in your skin when you are exposed to sunlight. If you eat a balanced diet and get outside in the sunshine at least 1.5 to 2 hours a week, you should be getting all the vitamin D you need.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods. For example, fat is needed so that vitamin D can be absorbed into the body.

La fenilcetonuria es causada por un defecto en el gen que ayuda a crear la enzima necesaria para descomponer la fenilalanina.   Sin la enzima necesaria para procesar la fenilalanina, se puede desarrollar una peligrosa acumulacin cuando una persona con fenilcetonuria ingiere alimentos con alto contenido de protenas. Esto puede provocar, con el tiempo, graves problemas de salud.   Por el resto de sus vidas, las personas con fenilcetonuria (bebs, nios y adultos) necesitan seguir una dieta que limite la fenilalanina, que se encuentra mayormente en alimentos con protenas.   Los bebs en los Estados Unidos y en muchos otros pases son examinados despus del nacimiento para detectar si tienen fenilcetonuria. Reconocer la fenilcetonuria de inmediato puede ayudar a prevenir mayores problemas de salud.       Sntomas   Share Tweet   Nov. 26, 2014   References     Phenylketonuria (Fenilcetonuria).

Background Taking cod liver oil as a source of vitamin D first became popular in 19th Century England. Fish oil has been studied for heart health since it was found that Greenland Inuit people may have a lower risk of heart disease despite eating a high-fat diet.   The main essential fatty acids in the human diet are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Foods that provide omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant and nut oils, while omega-6 fatty acids can be found in palm, soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower oils. Omega-9 fatty acids, which are not considered essential, can be found in animal fat and olive oil.   Fish oil contains two omega-3 fatty acids called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Some nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which may be converted to DHA and EPA in the body.   In the United States, percentages of DHA and EPA have been found to be lower compared to other nations with lower heart disease rates, such as Japan. High levels of omega-6 fatty acids have been linked to an increased risk of some conditions such as heart disease and depression.   Omega-3 fatty acids are thought to provide a wide range of health benefits, including a lower risk of coronary heart disease and improvement in cholesterol. There have also been promising results from studies looking at omega-3 for cancer, depression, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Due to these potential health benefits, fish oil, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, has become a popular supplement.   There is evidence that recommended amounts of DHA and EPA, taken as fish or fish oil supplements, may lower triglycerides and reduce the risk of heart attack, abnormal heartbeat, and stroke in people who have heart disorders. DHA and EPA may also benefit people who have hardening of the arteries or high blood pressure. Similar effects have been found for ALA, but more evidence is needed to support its potential benefits.   High doses may have harmful effects, such as increased bleeding risk, higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol, blood sugar control problems, and a ""fishy"" odor. In some at-risk populations, such as people who have had a heart transplant, omega-3 fatty acids may affect the heart rate. Omega-3 fatty acids should be used only under medical care in people who have heart disease. Some fish such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and albacore tuna may carry a higher risk of mercury poisoning, though fish oil has not been found to carry a significant risk.   Lovaza is a prescription drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in reducing very high triglycerides. It was first approved in November 2004 under the name Omacor through Reliant Pharmaceuticals. Due to prescriptions misfilled with the drug Amicar, the name was changed in July 2007 to Lovaza.

The body needs chromium for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough chromium in their regular diet or who have a need for more chromium, chromium supplements may be necessary. They are generally taken by mouth but some patients may have to receive them by injection. Chromium helps your body use sugar properly. It is also needed for the breakdown of proteins and fats.   Lack of chromium may lead to nerve problems and may decrease the body's ability to use sugar properly.   There is not enough evidence to show that taking chromium supplements improves the way your body uses sugar (glucose tolerance).   Injectable chromium is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Chromium is found in various foods, including brewer's yeast, calf liver, American cheese, and wheat germ.   The daily amount of chromium needed is defined in several different ways.    For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Because a lack of chromium is rare, there is no RDA or RNI for it. Normal daily recommended intakes for chromium are generally defined as follows:       Infants and children     Birth to 3 years of age10 to 80 micrograms (mcg) a day.     4 to 6 years of age30 to 120 mcg a day.     7 to 10 years of age50 to 200 mcg a day.

For patients who are unable to get enough molybdenum in their regular diet or who have a need for more molybdenum, molybdenum supplements may be necessary. They are generally taken by mouth in multivitamin/mineral products but some patients may have to receive them by injection. Molybdenum is part of certain enzymes that are important for several body functions.   A deficiency of molybdenum is rare. However, if the body does not get enough molybdenum, certain enzymes needed by the body are affected. This may lead to a build up of unwanted substances in some people.   Injectable molybdenum is administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   The amount of molybdenum in foods depends on the soil in which the food is grown. Some soils have more molybdenum than others. Peas, beans, cereal products, leafy vegetables, and low-fat milk are good sources of molybdenum.   The daily amount of molybdenum needed is defined in several different ways.

Vitamins are compounds that you must have for growth and health. They are needed in only small amounts and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Biotin is necessary for formation of fatty acids and glucose, which are used as fuels by the body. It is also important for the metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates.   A lack of biotin is rare. However, if it occurs it may lead to skin rash, loss of hair, high blood levels of cholesterol, and heart problems.   Some conditions may increase your need for biotin. These include:      Genetic disorder of biotin deficiency     Seborrheic dermatitis in infants     Surgical removal of the stomach      Increased need for biotin should be determined by your health care professional.   Claims that biotin supplements are effective in the treatment of acne, eczema (a type of skin disorder), or hair loss have not been proven.   Biotin supplements are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Biotin is found in various foods, including liver, cauliflower, salmon, carrots, bananas, soy flour, cereals, and yeast. Biotin content of food is reduced by cooking and preserving.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body needs other substances found in food, such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of biotin needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons.

They are needed in only small amounts and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B 5) is needed for the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.   No problems have been found that are due to a lack of pantothenic acid alone. However, a lack of one B vitamin usually goes along with a lack of others, so pantothenic acid is often included in B complex products.   Claims that pantothenic acid is effective for treatment of nerve damage, breathing problems, itching and other skin problems, and poisoning with some other drugs; for getting rid of or preventing gray hair; for preventing arthritis, allergies, and birth defects; or for improving mental ability have not been proven.   This vitamin is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Pantothenic acid is found in various foods including peas and beans (except green beans), lean meat, poultry, fish, and whole-grain cereals. Little pantothenic acid is lost from foods with ordinary cooking.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in foodprotein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat.   The daily amount of pantothenic acid needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) for nutrients are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DVs replace the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Because lack of pantothenic acid is so rare, there is no RDA or RNI for this vitamin. The following daily intakes are thought to be plenty for most individuals:      Infants and children      Birth to 3 years of age: 2 to 3 milligrams (mg).     4 to 6 years of age: 3 to 4 mg.     7 to 10 years of age: 4 to 5 mg.

It is usually present naturally in drinking water. However, some areas of the country do not have a high enough level in the water to prevent cavities. To make up for this, extra fluoride may be added to the diet. Some children may require both dietary fluoride and topical fluoride treatments by the dentist. Use of a fluoride toothpaste or rinse may be helpful as well.   Taking extra oral fluoride does not replace good dental habits. These include eating a good diet, brushing and flossing the teeth often, and having regular dental checkups.   Fluoride may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.   This medicine is available only with a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   People get needed fluoride from fish, including the bones, tea, and drinking water that has fluoride added to it. Food that is cooked in water containing fluoride or in Teflon-coated pans also provides fluoride. However, foods cooked in aluminum pans provide less fluoride.   The daily amount of fluoride needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).

For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      There is no RDA or RNI for fluoride. Daily recommended intakes for fluoride are generally defined as follows:   Infants and children      Birth to 3 years of age: 0.1 to 1.5 milligrams (mg).     4 to 6 years of age: 1 to 2.5 mg.     7 to 10 years of age: 1.5 to 2.5 mg.      Adolescents and adults      1.5 to 4 mg.      Remember:      The total amount of fluoride you get every day includes what you get from the foods and beverages that you eat and what you may take as a supplement.     This total amount should not be greater than the above recommendations, unless ordered by your health care professional. Taking too much fluoride can cause serious problems to the teeth and bones.

The body needs copper for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough copper in their regular diet or who have a need for more copper, copper supplements may be necessary. They are generally taken by mouth but some patients may have to receive them by injection. Copper is needed to help your body use iron. It is also important for nerve function, bone growth, and to help your body use sugar.   Lack of copper may lead to anemia and osteoporosis (weak bones).   Some conditions may increase your need for copper. These include:       Burns     Diarrhea     Intestine disease     Kidney disease     Pancreas disease     Stomach removal     Stress, continuing      Increased need for copper should be determined by your health care professional.   Claims that copper supplements are effective in the treatment of arthritis or skin conditions have not been proven. Use of copper supplements to cause vomiting has caused death and should be avoided.   Injectable copper is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Another form of copper is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Copper is found in various foods, including organ meats (especially liver), seafood, beans, nuts, and whole-grains. Additional copper can come from drinking water from copper pipes, using copper cookware, and eating farm products sprayed with copper-containing chemicals. Copper may be decreased in foods that have high acid content and are stored in tin cans for a long time.

Comprende las necesidades especficas de tu beb prematuro Si tienes un beb prematuro, comprende los desafos que tu beb puede enfrentar y recuerda la importancia de atender tus propias necesidades especficas. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Si tu beb naci antes de tiempo, el milagro del nacimiento puede ser eclipsado por la preocupacin sobre la salud de tu beb prematuro y los efectos posibles a largo plazo de la prematuridad. Sin embargo, hay mucho que puedes hacer para cuidar de tu beb prematuro  y de ti misma  mientras sigues adelante.     Los retos especiales de tu beb prematuro       Un beb prematuro o antes de trmino naci antes de completar las 37 semanas de gestacin. Por lo general, cuanto ms pronto nace un beb mayor es el riesgo de tener complicaciones.   Al principio, tu beb prematuro puede tener poca grasa corporal y necesitar ayuda para mantener el calor. El beb puede llorar nicamente de forma suave y tener problemas para respirar. Alimentar a tu beb prematuro puede ser un reto. Es posible que tenga la piel y los ojos de color amarillo (ictericia), baja azcar en la sangre y falta de glbulos rojos que lleven oxgeno a los tejidos de tu beb (anemia). Las afectaciones ms graves pueden incluir infeccin, episodios de respiracin interrumpida (apnea) y hemorragia en el cerebro. Algunos bebs prematuros presentan problemas en la audicin o visin.   Otros experimentan retraso en el desarrollo, problemas de aprendizaje, deficiencias motrices o problemas de comportamiento, psicolgicos o crnicos de salud. Sin embargo, muchos alcanzan y experimentan un desarrollo sano normal.     Cmo cuidar a tu beb prematuro       Las necesidades especiales de tu beb prematuro requieren de un cuidado especial, probablemente en una unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales (UCIN). En algunos casos, un beb prematuro necesita ser trasladado a un hospital que pueda proporcionarle atencin especializada. El equipo mdico a cargo de tu beb har todo lo posible para ayudar en su desarrollo. De igual manera, tu papel como padre es fundamental.     Averigua en qu condicin est tu beb prematuro.  La incertidumbre puede ser aterradora  as como los monitores, respiradores y otros tipos de equipo en la unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales. Escribe tus preguntas y busca respuestas cuando ests listo. Lee el material que proporciona el hospital o haz tu propia investigacin. Cuanto ms sepas, ms capaz sers de manejar la situacin.   Comparte tus observaciones y preocupaciones.  Si notas cambios en el trastorno de tu beb prematuro, comntalo con el equipo mdico responsable de inmediato.    Establece tu suministro de leche.  La leche materna contiene protenas que combaten las infecciones y promueven el crecimiento. A pesar de que en un principio tu beb prematuro puede no ser capaz de alimentarse de tu pecho o de un bibern, la leche materna puede darse de otras formas  o congelarse para usarla despus. Comienza a extraer leche tan pronto sea posible despus del nacimiento. Trata de extraer leche por lo menos de seis a ocho veces al da, de manera permanente. Tambin pregunta al mdico si tu beb necesita suplementos  ya sea en forma de fortificadores de la leche materna o frmula para lactantes prematuros.   Pasa tiempo con tu beb.  Hblale en tono amoroso y acarcialo con frecuencia. Leerle libros a tu beb puede ayudar a que te sientas ms cercano a l. Cuando tu beb est listo, arrllalo en tus brazos. Sostnlo bajo tu ropa para permitir el contacto directo con la piel. Aprende a alimentar, cambiar y tranquilizar a tu beb prematuro. Si te preocupa daar los tubos intravenosos o el cableado del monitor, pide ayuda al equipo mdico de tu beb. Considera personalizar la cama de tu beb con una manta especial o con fotos de la familia.         Next   Share Tweet   Aug. 30, 2014   References     McInerny TK, et al.

Ness, R.N.  March 24, 2015         Are you thinking about having a family? Certain cancer treatments and surgeries can affect fertility or cause sterility. Cancer treatment often is urgent and fertility may not be the first thing on your mind.   However, it's important to ask good questions and find out more about your individual situation prior to treatment when it comes to preserving your fertility options for later.   Cancer treatments may have temporary or permanent effects and may depend on your cancer type and your age. Common causes of infertility in cancer patients include:     Chemotherapy   can depend on drug dosage, length of treatment and type. Chemotherapy drugs called alkylating agents (such as busulfan, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and melphalan) are a class of drug that can have major effects on fertility.   Radiation   varies depending on the location and dose of radiation. The most severe damage occurs if radiation is given in the area of the ovaries or testicles.   Surgery   removal of the testicles for men and ovaries, uterus and cervix for women.   Age   women older than age 40 are more likely to go into early menopause as a result of cancer treatment.     To preserve fertility prior to treatment:     Both men and women should ask about chemotherapy effects and discuss options that may decrease the chance of permanent damage.   Women may want to explore embryo freezing, ovarian transposition and radiation shielding.   Men may want to discuss sperm banking prior to treatment and radiation shielding.     Fertility measures after treatment is completed may include:     Using frozen embryos or donor eggs   Pregnancy surrogate   Conception with the help of a fertility expert   Adoption   Testicular sperm extraction   Donor sperm     If you'd like to learn more about fertility options, resources include:     Mayo Clinic (www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/getting-pregnant/in-depth/fertility-preservation/art-20047512)   Fertile Hope (www.livestrong.org/fertilehope)   Oncofertility Consortium (www.myoncolfertility.org)     It's important to know that you may have options to preserve or protect your fertility. Feel free to bring this topic up early in the conversation with your treating doctor so that it can be addressed as part of your treatment plan.   I'd love to hear back from you. Please share your experiences on this topic.       With     	Sheryl M.

Maybe you've gotten a massage, tried biofeedback or added dietary supplements to your diet. These are forms of what used to be called complementary and alternative medicine.  Now, however, complementary and alternative medicine is most often referred to as integrative medicine.   Integrative medicine includes therapies that are used in addition to those used in conventional medicine, such as practicing yoga in addition to taking a prescription analgesic. Today the term ""integrative medicine"" is commonly used to describe health care practices and products that aren't generally part of conventional medicine but can be reasonably combined with conventional care.   Most of these integrative therapies aren't new. In fact, some  such as acupuncture and certain herbal remedies  have been around for thousands of years. These therapies are now experiencing a surge in popularity  especially when it comes to managing pain.   That's not surprising. Pain can leave you feeling helpless, with no control and at the mercy of the medications prescribed to you.  And although your prescriptions may be effective, you might struggle with side effects or fear the risks of increasing dosages or long-term use. Integrative therapies, on the other hand, can give you a broad range of philosophies and approaches to supplement the care your health care professional gives you, increase your relief from pain and improve your overall quality of life.     Combining conventional and unconventional care       The goal of integrative medicine is to treat the whole person  mind, body and spirit  not just an underlying disease. This can be accomplished by combining the best of conventional medicine with the best of less conventional practices  therapies that have a reasonable amount of high-quality evidence to support their use.   Researchers and health care professionals are finding that integrative medicine can provide positive outcomes for a broad range of pain causes. This is because pain is often a whole-body experience. Pain doesn't always come from just one source. There's the physical cause of the pain, of course  the injury, the joint pain, the muscle strain. But this physical pain can often be compounded by stress, frustration, fatigue, medication side effects and many other factors.   Conventional medicine typically only addresses physical pain. This is where integrative therapies can step in, to help with myriad other factors associated with pain. For example, a person who has knee surgery might be prescribed an analgesic to relieve post-surgery pain, visit a physical therapist to learn exercises to get moving again, and take a nutritional supplement to help with inflammation and joint health.     Are integrative pain therapies right for you?       You may wonder: Are integrative therapies safe? Could they actually work for me? Should I talk with my health care professional before using them?   These are all excellent questions. With their increasing popularity, more clinical research has been conducted on integrative therapies. Overall, the results are encouraging, and many conventional health care professionals are now incorporating integrative therapies that are supported by scientific studies into their practice of medicine.   Combined with conventional medicine, integrative approaches can help relieve pain and improve quality of life. Before you start any new treatment, however, do your research. Not all integrative therapies have been appropriately tested for safety and effectiveness.     Gather information.  Investigate specific therapies by viewing reputable websites and talking to your health care professional.   Use reputable therapy providers.  Only use providers who have professional credentials, or who come recommended by your health care professional.   Beware of interactions.  Ask whether any nutritional supplements you are considering taking might interfere with your over-the-counter or prescription medications.   Understand treatment costs.  Many integrative therapies aren't covered by health insurance.   Talk with your health care professional before trying something new.  This is especially important if you're pregnant or nursing.         Next   Share Tweet   July 26, 2016   References     Millman M, et al, eds. General symptoms.

The human body contains approximately 2-3 grams of zinc, mostly in the skeletal muscles and bones. Zinc is also found in the kidney, pancreas, retina, teeth, hair, skin, liver, blood cells, prostate, and testes.   Zinc is available through foods such as beef, pork, shellfish, peanuts, and legumes. Severe zinc deficiency may still be found in developing countries. Deficiency may cause problems with growth, diarrhea, hair loss, and immune function. Although it is rare in developed countries, some cases may be found in elderly and pregnant people. Mild zinc deficiency may be overlooked, since symptoms are not always obvious and may include loss of hair, appetite, weight, and the senses of taste and smell.   Zinc has been found to be effective for treating diarrhea, stomach ulcers, and zinc deficiency. There is good evidence to support its use for acne, ADHD, herpes simplex virus, immune function, and sickle cell anemia. Zinc has also been studied for Wilson's disease (excessive copper in the body), although results are mixed. Zinc has gained popularity for preventing the common cold, but research is still unclear.   There is still controversy on the role of zinc for many other diseases. Much evidence is conflicting or unclear.

Ness, R.N.  March 24, 2015         Are you thinking about having a family? Certain cancer treatments and surgeries can affect fertility or cause sterility. Cancer treatment often is urgent and fertility may not be the first thing on your mind.   However, it's important to ask good questions and find out more about your individual situation prior to treatment when it comes to preserving your fertility options for later.   Cancer treatments may have temporary or permanent effects and may depend on your cancer type and your age. Common causes of infertility in cancer patients include:     Chemotherapy   can depend on drug dosage, length of treatment and type. Chemotherapy drugs called alkylating agents (such as busulfan, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and melphalan) are a class of drug that can have major effects on fertility.   Radiation   varies depending on the location and dose of radiation. The most severe damage occurs if radiation is given in the area of the ovaries or testicles.   Surgery   removal of the testicles for men and ovaries, uterus and cervix for women.   Age   women older than age 40 are more likely to go into early menopause as a result of cancer treatment.     To preserve fertility prior to treatment:     Both men and women should ask about chemotherapy effects and discuss options that may decrease the chance of permanent damage.   Women may want to explore embryo freezing, ovarian transposition and radiation shielding.   Men may want to discuss sperm banking prior to treatment and radiation shielding.     Fertility measures after treatment is completed may include:     Using frozen embryos or donor eggs   Pregnancy surrogate   Conception with the help of a fertility expert   Adoption   Testicular sperm extraction   Donor sperm     If you'd like to learn more about fertility options, resources include:     Mayo Clinic (www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/getting-pregnant/in-depth/fertility-preservation/art-20047512)   Fertile Hope (www.livestrong.org/fertilehope)   Oncofertility Consortium (www.myoncolfertility.org)     It's important to know that you may have options to preserve or protect your fertility. Feel free to bring this topic up early in the conversation with your treating doctor so that it can be addressed as part of your treatment plan.   I'd love to hear back from you. Please share your experiences on this topic.       With     	Sheryl M.

The body needs selenium for normal growth and health. Selenium is needed for certain enzymes that help with normal body functions.   Although selenium is being used to prevent certain types of cancer, there is not enough information to show that this is effective.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Selenium is found in seafood, liver, lean red meat, and grains grown in soil that is rich in selenium.   The daily amount of selenium needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs)      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes for selenium are generally defined as follows:      Birth to 3 years of age: 10 to 20 micrograms (mcg) per day.     4 to 6 years of age: 20 mcg per day.     7 to 10 years of age: 30 mcg per day.     Adolescent and adult males40 to 70 mcg per day.     Adolescent and adult females45 to 55 mcg per day.     Pregnant females65 mcg per day.     Breast-feeding females75 mcg per day.

No matter what you're dealing with, seeking support can make the difference between reaching your goals  or not. By Amy M. Charland             As you make healthy lifestyle changes, it's inevitable that challenges, such as an illness, financial dip, career change or relationship conflict, will come up. Or perhaps you're struggling to stick with your healthy-eating plan or stay motivated to exercise. No matter what you're dealing with, you don't have to face difficult moments alone. Seeking support during trying times can make the difference between reaching your goals  or not. So why not ask for help? It's a sign of strength, not weakness.   Asking for support can help you:     Stay energized.  Change takes a lot of energy. Your reserves can be depleted easily if you take everything on by yourself. When your energy is low, fill up your tank by reaching out for support. Don't be scared to ask for favors, especially if this will help you stay on track.        Keep your motivation alive.  When you hit a roadblock on your journey to making healthy changes, it can be easy to start wondering if it's really worth the effort. A positive and strong support network can lift you up during these times and remind you of why you're working so hard to change.        Share the gift of happiness.  When you share your talents and strengths with others, you tend to be happier. So allow others in your life to use their talents to support you  it will make them feel good, too.        Create connections.  Research suggests that when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, we become ""relatable."" When you ask for support, you let others in and create connections. Humans are wired to want to connect with others.        Reach your goals.  By seeking support, you increase your resources, especially during challenging times when you could easily become derailed. Let your support network keep you on the track to success. Getting an outsider's perspective may help you recognize an idea you haven't considered before or give you motivation at a time you need it most.          The truth is that no one can do it alone. We all need backup from time to time. The key is to know what type of support you need, when to ask for support and who to ask. Keep this in mind, along with a sense of gratitude, and you'll get the support you need when you need it.     Experiments         Take a coffee break with a colleague, or strike up a conversation with a neighbor or someone else you see on a regular basis. Connecting with others is a great first step to finding people you can lean on.   Call a family member or friend you trust and respect. Confide in them and let them know how they can support you through the challenge you're facing. You might be surprised at their open and warm response.   Make an appointment with a doctor, counselor or licensed therapist to talk out your concerns, anxieties and goals. Seeking professional help is nothing to be ashamed of.

Disappointing news from the scale might even send you straight for the nearest comfort food. Try practicing mindfulness to make the scale your friend. By Jamie L. Friend             If you're like many people trying to lose weight, the number you see on the scale in the morning can impact your entire day. For many people, the scale measures self-worth as well as weight.   If you weigh less than you thought you would, you feel confident and successful. But if your weight is higher than expected, you might think, ""I can't do anything right,"" or ""All of the hard work I put into exercising and trying to eat right didn't make a difference, so why do I bother?"" The scale's disappointing news might even send you straight for the nearest comfort food.   What if you could stand in front of the scale without fear? It's possible, and the key is mindfulness.   At its root, mindfulness involves paying attention, on purpose, without judgment. Using this approach, you weigh yourself without judgment, recognizing that self-recrimination doesn't help you lose weight. On the contrary, research shows that when you judge yourself harshly, you're more likely to seek comfort  which may come in the form of high-calorie foods or inactivity.         Here are three ways to start changing how you feel about what your scale tells you.   Stop judging.  Instead of toggling between loving and hating the scale, think about what it's telling you and how that information can help you. Ask yourself, ""What can I learn from this?"" This will help you determine what steps to take next in your weight-loss journey.   Be kind to yourself.  You're human. Criticizing yourself, isolating yourself or letting your worries get the best of you won't help you reach your goals. These behaviors only show that you're in need of a little self-compassion. When you start to criticize yourself, challenge your thoughts by asking, ""Is what I'm telling myself right now 100 percent true? Am I really a bad person because the number on the scale is higher than I expected?""   Change how you look at the scale.  You certainly don't have to love your scale, but you can turn your negative thoughts into more positive ones. You might tell yourself, ""This number is a marker to help me know if my behavior changes are working for me."" Or, ""This number measures just a small part of me. It doesn't include my strong passion and desire for my job, my love for my family and friends, my talents and strengths."" Here's one more: ""The scale is only one measurement. It doesn't show changes in my body fat percentage or how my clothes are fitting differently on my body.""   It might even help you to write ""What can I learn from this?"" on a piece of paper and hang it above your scale where you can see it every time you weigh yourself. Then bravely step forward  and hold your head high, no matter what number you see.       Next   Share Tweet   Dec. 07, 2016   References     Mantzios M, et al.

You can take steps to increase your confidence in your ability to lose weight. By Karin M. Pyan             There's no doubt about it: Changing habits is hard. So if you've had weight-loss disappoints in the past, it's understandable that your confidence in making lasting changes might be low. However, the stronger your belief is that you can accomplish a goal or change a behavior, the better your chances of success are. Behavioral experts call this self-efficacy. And it can make or break your weight-loss efforts.   Think about how you view yourself. Are you struggling to believe in your ability to lose weight? It's normal to feel apprehensive in the beginning. But with practice you can improve your sense of self-efficacy and boost your confidence. Try these strategies:     Set realistic expectations.  Do you expect immediate results? It's common to set goals that aren't realistic. For example, you may set yourself up for failure if you go from not exercising at all to trying to work out for an hour every day. Instead, focus on small, achievable changes, such as walking for at least 10 minutes daily, so you can experience feelings of success every week. As you achieve small goals, your self-confidence will improve and you can build up to larger changes.   Recognize success.  Take time to celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small. Did you take the stairs instead of the escalator one day? Eat a healthy breakfast three days in a row? Give yourself a pat on the back. You may not usually acknowledge the small things, but doing so will help you stay positive and confident.   Maintain a learning mindset.  Accept that setbacks will occur. How you deal with obstacles impacts your confidence and will to keep going. Approach challenges with an open mind. Refrain from judging yourself, and reflect on the experience by using it as an opportunity to grow. Ask yourself, ""What can I learn from this experience?""    Practice positive self-talk.  Self-talk is your inner dialogue  what you say to yourself in any given moment. With practice, you can begin to change negative thoughts into positive ones. For example, instead of saying, ""I'll never reach my weight-loss goal,"" try, ""Reaching my goal weight takes time, but I can do it if I stick to it.""   Find healthy support.  The people closest to you may feel intimidated by your desire to make healthy changes. Tell them how important their support is and what they can do to encourage you. Be sure to connect with others who have similar goals. If you see others achieving similar goals, you're more likely to believe you can accomplish your goals, too.       Experiments         Connect with a friend or family member who is also working on healthy changes. Discuss ways to support each other. For example, check in regularly over the phone or plan weekly walking dates.   Catch negative thoughts that pop into your mind throughout the day and turn them into positive reinforcements. Instead of saying, ""I can't stick with an exercise program,"" try, ""I can meet one realistic goal today.""   Make a list of daily accomplishments, no matter how small. Add to this list every day. This allows you to focus on what is going well in your life, instead of what isn't.

Getting to a healthy weight and exercising regularly are both important goals. But to increase your odds of a long, healthy life, improving your cardiovascular fitness should be priority No. 1. Even if you're carrying some extra pounds, you can boost your cardiovascular fitness  here's how. By Joel P. French, Ph.D.             Being thin or being fit: Which is more important? Of course, getting to a healthy weight and exercising regularly are both important goals. But to increase your odds of a long, healthy life, improving your cardiovascular fitness should be priority No. 1, according to scientists who study weight, exercise and longevity.   Consider this example: Mara is at her ideal weight, but she can't walk to the bus stop without getting winded. Michael is overweight, but he can walk up three flights of stairs and hardly feel it. Who has the best chance at a long, healthy life?   Most experts would argue that it's Michael. Despite his extra pounds, his three-day-a-week swimming habit boosts his cardiovascular fitness. That, in turn, lowers his risk of dying prematurely (mortality risk).   Even though Mara isn't overweight, she spends long days at her desk and too many nights in front of a screen.     Zero fitness? You have the most to gain       If you're more like Mara than Michael, you can significantly reduce your mortality risk by simply going from no activity to some activity. Pause for a 15-minute daily walk at an easy pace. Build up to 20 minutes and walk faster, and you'll lower your risk even more.   Getting to a healthy weight is still one of the most important goals you can set for yourself. It can help you avoid or control conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, joint problems and even pregnancy complications.   But if your goal is living well and living long, work on improving your cardiovascular fitness. In fact, unless you're an elite athlete at peak fitness, you'll gain health benefits every time you add distance, time or intensity to your daily activities.     How to measure fitness       Exercise physiologists gauge fitness by looking at your ""VO2 max."" That's the amount of oxygen your heart can pump throughout your body when you move. (If you're curious, the V is for volume, the O for oxygen.)   You can have your VO2 measured by  an exercise physiologist or other fitness expert, who will perform a simple test to see how your heart rate responds as you add exercise intensity by working harder. You'll come away with a target heart rate matched to your current fitness and a plan for how to keep improving.   You can also gauge your VO2 max yourself by looking at how easy or hard it is for you to perform common daily activities.       Next   Share Tweet   Dec. 09, 2016   References      Barry V, et al.

Labor and delivery generally follows a pattern  the cervix softening and opening; the amniotic sac rupturing; the contractions getting stronger and closer together. Sometimes, however, labor and delivery takes surprising twists and turns. You might reconsider your wishes about pain medication, or you might need an unexpected C-section.   However your labor and delivery unfolds, remember that your health and your baby's health are what's most important.

Si te preocupa el peso ...  ",http://www.mayoclinic.org/es-es/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/expert-answers/baby-fat/faq-20058296,"Cmo puedo saber si el peso de mi beb debe preocuparme?    Answers from  Jay L. Hoecker, M.D.         Si te preocupa el peso del beb, consulta al mdico del beb. El crecimiento, el desarrollo y el peso son excelentes temas para analizar durante los exmenes de rutina del beb.   Durante el primer ao de vida, para evaluar el crecimiento del beb, el mdico se fijar en tablas que muestran el peso para la longitud. Luego, el mdico del beb calcular su ndice de masa corporal (IMC). Puedes usar los cuadros para observar la tendencia del crecimiento del nio y comparar dicho crecimiento con el de otros bebs del mismo sexo y edad. Segn las tablas de crecimiento de la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud (World Health Organization), se considera que un beb con un peso para la longitud superior al percentil 98 tiene un peso elevado para su longitud.   Recuerda que los bebs necesitan una dieta con alto contenido de grasas para promover su crecimiento. Un beb al que se amamanta de forma exclusiva recibe aproximadamente la mitad de las caloras diarias que necesita de la grasa de la leche materna.  En consecuencia, no se recomiendan las restricciones calricas destinadas a reducir el peso para los bebs de hasta 2aos.   Sin embargo, el exceso de grasa y caloras puede ser un motivo de preocupacin. Por ejemplo, el hecho de estar muy pesado puede hacer que el beb demore en comenzar a gatear y a caminar, partes esenciales de su desarrollo fsico y mental. Si bien un beb de tamao grande puede no convertirse en un nio con sobrepeso, un nio obeso a menudo sigue siendo obeso en la edad adulta.    Para que el beb mantenga un peso saludable:     Supervisa tu aumento de peso durante el embarazo.  El aumento excesivo de peso durante el embarazo puede incrementar el peso del beb al nacer. La investigacin sugiere que, mientras mayor sea el peso al nacer, mayor ser el riesgo de obesidad infantil.   Amamanta.  Algunas investigaciones sugieren que la lactancia reduce el riesgo de obesidad infantil.   Limita las bebidas con azcar.  El jugo no es una parte necesaria de la dieta del beb. Cuando comiences a darle alimentos slidos, considera ofrecerle frutas y vegetales nutritivos en su lugar.   Busca formas de calmar al beb.  No recurras automticamente a la leche materna o maternizada para calmar el llanto del beb. A veces, todo lo que necesita es una nueva posicin, un ambiente ms tranquilo o una caricia.   Limita el uso de los medios.  La American Academy of Pediatrics (Academia Estadounidense de Pediatra) no recomienda el uso de los medios en nios menores de 2aos. Mientras ms televisin vea el nio, mayor ser su riesgo de tener sobrepeso.     A medida que el nio crezca, sigue hablando con su mdico sobre el peso y la nutricin. Para obtener ms asesoramiento, tambin podras consultar a un dietista registrado.         With      Jay L.

Phosphate is the drug form (salt) of phosphorus. Some phosphates are used to make the urine more acid, which helps treat certain urinary tract infections. Some phosphates are used to prevent the formation of calcium stones in the urinary tract.   Injectable phosphates are to be administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Some of these oral preparations are available only with a prescription. Others are available without a prescription; however, your health care professional may have special instructions on the proper dose of this medicine for your medical condition. You should take phosphates only under the supervision of your health care professional.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   The best dietary sources of phosphorus include dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and cereal products.   The daily amount of phosphorus needed is defined in several different ways.    For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes for phosphorus are generally defined as follows:    Information about this phosphate-supplement-oral-route-parenteral-route   Persons   U.S.  (mg)   Canada  (mg)     Infants birth to 3 years of age   300800   150350     Children 4 to 6 years of age   800   400     Children 7 to 10 years of age   800   500800     Adolescent and adult males   8001200   7001000     Adolescent and adult females   8001200   800850     Pregnant females   1200   1050     Breast-feeding females   1200   1050     This product is available in the following dosage forms:     Tablet   Tablet, Enteric Coated   Liquid       Before Using   Portions of this document last updated:  March 01, 2017   Copyright  2017 Truven Health Analytics Inc.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) is necessary for normal breakdown of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.   Some conditions may increase your need for pyridoxine. These include:      Alcoholism     Burns     Diarrhea     Dialysis     Heart disease     Intestinal problems     Liver disease     Overactive thyroid     Stress, long-term illness, or serious injury     Surgical removal of stomach      In addition, infants receiving unfortified formulas such as evaporated milk may need additional pyridoxine.   Increased need for pyridoxine should be determined by your health care professional.   Lack of pyridoxine may lead to anemia (weak blood), nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth. Your doctor may treat these problems by prescribing pyridoxine for you.   Claims that pyridoxine is effective for treatment of acne and other skin problems, alcohol intoxication, asthma, hemorrhoids, kidney stones, mental problems, migraine headaches, morning sickness, and menstrual problems, or to stimulate appetite or milk production have not been proven.   Injectable pyridoxine is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms of pyridoxine are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Pyridoxine is found in various foods, including meats, bananas, lima beans, egg yolks, peanuts, and whole-grain cereals. Pyridoxine is not lost from food during ordinary cooking, although some other forms of vitamin B 6 are.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of pyridoxine needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).

For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes for pyridoxine are generally defined as follows:      Infants and children      Birth to 3 years of age: 0.3 to 1 milligram (mg).     4 to 6 years of age: 1.1 mg.     7 to 10 years of age: 1.4 mg.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) is needed to help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It also makes it possible for oxygen to be used by your body.   Lack of riboflavin may lead to itching and burning eyes, sensitivity of eyes to light, sore tongue, itching and peeling skin on the nose and scrotum, and sores in the mouth. Your doctor may treat this condition by prescribing riboflavin for you.   Some conditions may increase your need for riboflavin. These include:      Alcoholism     Burns     Cancer     Diarrhea (continuing)     Fever (continuing)     Illness (continuing)     Infection     Intestinal diseases     Liver disease     Overactive thyroid     Serious injury     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach      In addition, riboflavin may be given to infants with high blood levels of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia).   Increased need for riboflavin should be determined by your health care professional.   Claims that riboflavin is effective for treatment of acne, some kinds of anemia (weak blood), migraine headaches, and muscle cramps have not been proven.   Oral forms of riboflavin are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Riboflavin is found in various foods, including milk and dairy products, fish, meats, green leafy vegetables, and whole grain and enriched cereals and bread. It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins, although little riboflavin is lost from foods during ordinary cooking.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of riboflavin needed is defined in several different ways.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Thiamine (vitamin B 1) is needed for the breakdown of carbohydrates.   Some conditions may increase your need for thiamine. These include:      Alcoholism     Burns     Diarrhea (continuing)     Fever (continuing)     Illness (continuing)     Intestinal disease     Liver disease     Overactive thyroid     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach      Also, the following groups of people may have a deficiency of thiamine:      Patients using an artificial kidney (on hemodialysis)     Individuals who do heavy manual labor on a daily basis      Increased need for thiamine should be determined by your health care professional.   Lack of thiamine may lead to a condition called beriberi. Signs of beriberi include loss of appetite, constipation, muscle weakness, pain or tingling in arms or legs, and possible swelling of feet or lower legs. In addition, if severe, lack of thiamine may cause mental depression, memory problems, weakness, shortness of breath, and fast heartbeat. Your health care professional may treat this by prescribing thiamine for you.   Thiamine may also be used for other conditions as determined by your health care professional.   Claims that thiamine is effective for treatment of skin problems, chronic diarrhea, tiredness, mental problems, multiple sclerosis, nerve problems, and ulcerative colitis (a disease of the intestines), or as an insect repellant or to stimulate appetite have not been proven.   Injectable thiamine is administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Other forms of thiamine are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Thiamine is found in various foods, including cereals (whole-grain and enriched), peas, beans, nuts, and meats (especially pork and beef). Some thiamine in foods is lost with cooking.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of thiamine needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes in milligrams (mg) for thiamine are generally defined as follows:   Information about this thiamine-oral-route-injection-route   Persons   U.S. (mg)   Canada (mg)     Infants and children   Birth to 3 years of age   0.30.7   0.30.6      4 to 6 years of age   0.9   0.7     7 to 10 years of age   1   0.81     Adolescent and adult males   1.21.5   0.81.3     Adolescent and adult females   11.1   0.80.9     Pregnant females   1.5   0.91     Breast-feeding females   1.6   11.2     This product is available in the following dosage forms:     Tablet   Solution   Capsule   Tablet, Enteric Coated       Before Using   Portions of this document last updated:  March 01, 2017   Copyright  2017 Truven Health Analytics Inc.

For people younger than 20 or older than 74, the presence of two or more cardiovascular risk factors suggests a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. If you're in that category, you should seek additional evaluation and treatment advice from your doctor.                             Have you ever had any of the following conditions or procedures?       Heart attack or coronary bypass surgery   Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)   Peripheral artery disease  reduced blood flow in arteries in your legs, arms or other areas   Angioplasty or stent placement  a procedure to open narrowed or clogged arteries by placing a small tube (stent) in an artery to keep it open and prevent it from narrowing   Abdominal aortic aneurysm  enlargement of the lower area of the major blood vessel (aorta) that supplies blood to the body   None of the above                 Have your parents, siblings or children had any of the following at an early age (younger than age 55 for men and younger than age 65 for women)?

Note:  Vigorous physical activity is any activity that makes you breathe much harder than usual, such as aerobic exercise or fast bicycling. Moderately intense physical activity makes you breathe somewhat harder than usual, such as bicycling at a regular pace or doubles tennis.       At least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity or 150 minutes a week of moderately intense physical activity each week   Less than 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity or less than 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity each week   No physical activity                 How many servings of fruits and vegetables do you eat in a typical day?

Note: One serving is about the size of a small apple or small potato.       5 or more servings   2 to 4 servings   0 to 1 servings                 How many servings of saturated (animal) fats do you eat each day (not including low-fat dairy, white and skinless turkey, white and skinless chicken, or fish)?   Serving sizes of common foods with saturated fat: Hamburger, steak, bacon, ham, sausage (3 ounces or the size of a deck of cards); butter (1 teaspoon); whole milk (1 cup); ice cream (1/2 cup); cheese (1 prepackaged slice, about 1 ounce).       5 or more servings   2 to 4 servings   0 to 1 servings               Since you have a history of cardiovascular disease,  work with your doctor to determine your risk.     Your   risk of  cardiovascular disease heart attack or stroke     Your   risk represents the chance that you'll have  cardiovascular disease a heart attack or stroke  at any point in the next  s.         Take action to reduce your risk   Risk factors       Take action to reduce your risk     If you were to control your risk factors for  cardiovascular disease heart attack or stroke  to acceptable levels, then your   risk would be:        Your risk of cardiovascular disease is at or near the acceptable level. Keep up the good work!       Before increasing your physical activity level, check with your doctor to make sure it's safe for you to proceed.          Gradually increase your physical activity toward a goal of at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or an equal combination of moderate and vigorous activity a week. Perform at least 10 minutes of aerobic exercise at one time, and spread aerobic exercise throughout your week. Include strength training exercises at least two days a week.           Gradually increase your physical activity toward a goal of at least 150 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity, 300 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity, or an equal combination of moderate and vigorous activity a week. Perform at least 10 minutes of aerobic exercise at one time, and spread aerobic exercise throughout your week. Include strength training exercises at least two days a week.           If you're currently doing no physical activity, you may want to consider starting with 15 minutes of physical activity two or three days a week, and work your way up gradually to the goals listed above.

Carlson, R.N., C.D.E.   September 29, 2016         To understand diabetes, it's helpful to understand how glucose and insulin work together in the body.   Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas which works like a key.  The insulin key attaches itself to an insulin receptor on the surface of the cell which opens a channel for glucose to move from the bloodstream into the cell.  If this mechanism is working properly, the glucose level in the blood stays low while the cells get the energy (in the form of glucose) that they need to function.   Type 1 diabetes develops when, for reasons that aren't clear, the body gets rid of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas.  Sometimes this happens in people with a family history of type 1 diabetes.  Also at higher risk for type 1 diabetes are people with autoimmune diseases.   Type 2 diabetes, which is far more common than type 1, develops from low insulin production and/or insulin resistance.  Low insulin production simply means that the pancreas isn't producing enough insulin to meet the body's needs.   Insulin resistance is a condition in which the insulin receptors on the surface of the cells won't allow the insulin to attach and thus the channel for glucose to move from the bloodstream into the cells remains closed.   Type 2 diabetes may happen in people who have a family history of diabetes.  In addition, conditions which increase the body's need for insulin raise the chances of developing diabetes. These include:     Extra weight.   A large waist.   Inactivity.   The risk goes up as you get older, especially after age 45.   Although it's not clear why, people of certain races  including African-Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders  are more likely to develop diabetes than other groups.   If you had gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing diabetes later goes up.  If you gave birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds, you also are at a higher risk of diabetes.   For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome raises the risk of diabetes.   Sleep problems.   Smoking.     Some of these risk factors, such as family history, age and race, can't be modified.  Changing the modifiable risk factors isn't easy, but it can be done.  Whether you have diabetes or are at risk for developing diabetes, talk to your health care provider about ways to improve your chance of living a long and healthy life.       With      Sara J.

Ness, R.N.  October 5, 2013          A Mayo Clinic breast cancer genome guided therapy study, known as the BEAUTY study, is working to develop individualized care for women with breast cancer.     The study is designed for women who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer and planning to have chemotherapy treatment before surgery (also called neoadjuvant chemotherapy).     One focus is why current standard chemotherapy works well for some patients but not for others. Another is to develop drugs to improve and individualize care based on the tumor genetic make-up.     State-of-the-art genomics tools are used to allow researchers to understand why some tumors respond better than others to chemotherapy.     Genetic information will be collected both from patients' tumors as well as their blood, in order to allow a full analysis of all of the genomic alterations that affect response to the different chemotherapy drugs that are administered during the study.     Biopsies taken from the breast tumor during the study allow researchers the ability to preserve and grow the patient's cancers in laboratory mice (outside of the body) in order to test and find the chemotherapy drug(s) that works best for each patient's tumor.     These xenografts (also called avatars) provide the most realistic reproduction of the patient's tumor and the best opportunity for researchers to individualize care by developing drugs customized for future patients based on the genetic makeup of the tumor.     The study also involves the use of molecular breast imaging (MBI), a new imaging tool that helps doctors better image breast cancer. MBI produces a more accurate image of tumor location and size providing information on how the tumor is responding to chemotherapy.     All women newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer planning to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible to participate in the study who:      Are eligible for chemotherapy before surgery   Have a 1.5 cm or larger tumor with no cancer elsewhere (except possibly in their lymph nodes)   Aren't pregnant or breastfeeding      Participants will be closely monitored by medical oncologists along with imaging (including MRI and MBI scans) to see how their tumors respond to chemotherapy.     Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected at multiple time points in the study. The first biopsy is performed before starting any chemotherapy; the second after 12 weeks of chemotherapy, and finally, tissue from the tumor is collected at the time of surgery.     Tumor imaging is done at the same time points that biopsies are collected. Women taking part in the study will be followed closely for 5 years.

Read comments       July 9, 2015 4:01 a.m.   Patients who have chronic hetalh conditions and disabilities and their families are seeking providers who embrace and practice patient and family-centered care.  This means providers who see patients and families as colleagues in care, recognizing and valuing the expertise and experience patients and families bring as an equal member of the hetalh care team.  I use the term colleague rather than partnership, because it implies a different type of realtionship. The term colleague reflects a recognition of the expertise and experience brought to the relationship.  This concept does not de-value the important expertise and experience of physicians, but recognizes that the contribution of patients and families is equally valuable as the process of diagnosis occurs and decisions are made about treatment. This concept requires attitudinal and culture changes for physicians.Equally important to colleagueship in individual care is the meaningful involvement of patients and families in hetalh care program and policy design, implementation and evaluation.  Patients and families who frequently use the hetalh care system have valuable knowledge about how systems really work, not how they were designed to work.  They are often expert at coming up with creative solutions to problems, and are invaluable in teaching hetalh professionals about other systems of care.  For a hetalh system to be truly patient and family-centered they must not only include but incorporate the role of patient and family advisors on committees throughout the system.

They are needed in only small amounts and are available in the foods that you eat. Vitamin E prevents a chemical reaction called oxidation, which can sometimes result in harmful effects in your body. It is also important for the proper function of nerves and muscles.   Some conditions may increase your need for vitamin E. These include:      Intestine disease     Liver disease     Pancreas disease     Surgical removal of stomach      Increased need for vitamin E should be determined by your health care professional.   Infants who are receiving a formula that is not fortified with vitamin E may be likely to have a vitamin E deficiency. Also, diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids may increase your need for vitamin E.   Claims that vitamin E is effective for treatment of cancer and for prevention or treatment of acne, aging, loss of hair, bee stings, liver spots on the hands, bursitis, diaper rash, frostbite, stomach ulcer, heart attacks, labor pains, certain blood diseases, miscarriage, muscular dystrophy, poor posture, sexual impotence, sterility, infertility, menopause, sunburn, and lung damage from air pollution have not been proven. Although vitamin E is being used to prevent certain types of cancer, there is not enough information to show that this is effective.   Lack of vitamin E is extremely rare, except in people who have a disease in which it is not absorbed into the body.   Vitamin E is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Vitamin E is found in various foods including vegetable oils (corn, cottonseed, soybean, safflower), wheat germ, whole-grain cereals, and green leafy vegetables. Cooking and storage may destroy some of the vitamin E in foods.   Vitamin supplements alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods. For example, small amounts of fat are needed so that vitamin E can be absorbed into the body.   The daily amount of vitamin E needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Vitamin E is available in various forms, including d- or dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, d- or dl-alpha tocopherol, and d- or dl-alpha tocopheryl acid succinate. In the past, the RDA for vitamin E have been expressed in Units. This term has been replaced by alpha tocopherol equivalents (alpha-TE) or milligrams (mg) of d-alpha tocopherol. One Unit is equivalent to 1 mg of dl-alpha tocopherol acetate or 0.6 mg d-alpha tocopherol. Most products available in stores continue to be labeled in Units.   Normal daily recommended intakes in milligrams (mg) of alpha tocopherol equivalents (mg alpha-TE) and Units for vitamin E are generally defined as follows:   Information about this vitamin-e-oral-route   Persons   U.S.   Canada     mg  alpha-TE   Units   mg  alpha-TE   Units     Infants and children   Birth to 3 years of  age   36    510   34    56.7      4 to 6 years of age   7   11.7   5   8.3      7 to 10 years of age   7   11.7   68   1013      Adolescent and adult  males   10    16.7   610    1016.7      Adolescent and adult  females    8   13   57   8.311.7      Pregnant females    10   16.7   89   1315     Breast-feeding  females   1112    1820   910    1516.7      This product is available in the following dosage forms:     Liquid   Solution   Tablet   Capsule, Liquid Filled   Tablet, Chewable   Powder for Solution   Capsule       Before Using   Portions of this document last updated:  March 01, 2017   Copyright  2017 Truven Health Analytics Inc.

When the body does not get enough iron, it cannot produce the number of normal red blood cells needed to keep you in good health. This condition is called iron deficiency (iron shortage) or iron deficiency anemia.   Although many people in the U.S. get enough iron from their diet, some must take additional amounts to meet their needs. For example, iron is sometimes lost with slow or small amounts of bleeding in the body that you would not be aware of and which can only be detected by your doctor. Your doctor can determine if you have an iron deficiency, what is causing the deficiency, and if an iron supplement is necessary.   Lack of iron may lead to unusual tiredness, shortness of breath, a decrease in physical performance, and learning problems in children and adults, and may increase your chance of getting an infection.   Some conditions may increase your need for iron. These include:       Bleeding problems     Burns     Hemodialysis     Intestinal diseases     Stomach problems     Stomach removal     Use of medicines to increase your red blood cell count      In addition, infants, especially those receiving breast milk or low-iron formulas, may need additional iron.   Increased need for iron supplements should be determined by your health care professional.   Injectable iron is administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Other forms of iron are available without a prescription; however, your health care professional may have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your condition.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Iron is found in the diet in two formsheme iron, which is well absorbed, and nonheme iron, which is poorly absorbed. The best dietary source of absorbable (heme) iron is lean red meat. Chicken, turkey, and fish are also sources of iron, but they contain less than red meat. Cereals, beans, and some vegetables contain poorly absorbed (nonheme) iron. Foods rich in vitamin C (e.g., citrus fruits and fresh vegetables), eaten with small amounts of heme iron-containing foods, such as meat, may increase the amount of nonheme iron absorbed from cereals, beans, and other vegetables. Some foods (e.g., milk, eggs, spinach, fiber-containing, coffee, tea) may decrease the amount of nonheme iron absorbed from foods. Additional iron may be added to food from cooking in iron pots.   The daily amount of iron needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Normal daily recommended intakes in milligrams (mg) for iron are generally defined as follows (Note that the RDA and RNI are expressed as an actual amount of iron, which is referred to as elemental' iron.

They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Ascorbic acid, also known as vitamin C, is necessary for wound healing. It is needed for many functions in the body, including helping the body use carbohydrates, fats, and protein. Vitamin C also strengthens blood vessel walls.   Lack of vitamin C can lead to a condition called scurvy, which causes muscle weakness, swollen and bleeding gums, loss of teeth, and bleeding under the skin, as well as tiredness and depression. Wounds also do not heal easily. Your health care professional may treat scurvy by prescribing vitamin C for you.   Some conditions may increase your need for vitamin C. These include:      AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)     Alcoholism     Burns     Cancer     Diarrhea (prolonged)     Fever (prolonged)     Infection (prolonged)     Intestinal diseases     Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)     Stomach ulcer     Stress (continuing)     Surgical removal of stomach     Tuberculosis      Also, the following groups of people may have a deficiency of vitamin C:      Infants receiving unfortified formulas     Smokers     Patients using an artificial kidney (on hemodialysis)     Patients who undergo surgery     Individuals who are exposed to long periods of cold temperatures       Increased need for vitamin C should be determined by your health care professional.   Vitamin C may be used for other conditions as determined by your health care professional.   Claims that vitamin C is effective for preventing senility and the common cold, and for treating asthma, some mental problems, cancer, hardening of the arteries, allergies, eye ulcers, blood clots, gum disease, and pressure sores have not been proven. Although vitamin C is being used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer, there is not enough information to show that these uses are effective.   Injectable vitamin C is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Other forms of vitamin C are available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Vitamin C is found in various foods, including citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, grapefruit), green vegetables (peppers, broccoli, cabbage), tomatoes, and potatoes. It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins. For example, exposure to air, drying, salting, or cooking (especially in copper pots), mincing of fresh vegetables, or mashing potatoes may reduce the amount of vitamin C in foods. Freezing does not usually cause loss of vitamin C unless foods are stored for a very long time.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.   The daily amount of vitamin C needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).

July 2, 2015         One-third of adults with diabetes don't know they have it, according to the National Institutes of Health.   Even though the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in the United States has risen to 6.5 percent of adults age 20 and older, the percentage of adults with undiagnosed pre-diabetes or diabetes hasn't changed.   The NIH says that you are at greater risk of developing pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes if you:     Are age 45 or older   Have a family history of diabetes   Are overweight   Have an inactive lifestyle   Are members of a high-risk ethnic population (e.g., African American, Hispanic/Latino American, American Indian and Alaska native, Asian American, Pacific Islander)   Have high blood pressure: 140/90 mm/Hg or higher   Have HDL cholesterol less than 35 mg/dL or a triglyceride level 250 mg/dL or higher   Have had diabetes that developed during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) or have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds   Have polycystic ovary syndrome, a metabolic disorder that affects the female reproductive system   Have dark, thickened skin around neck or armpits   Have a history of disease of the blood vessels to the heart, brain, or legs     So, if you're age 45 or older, ask your healthcare provider about testing for diabetes or pre-diabetes. If you're younger than 45 and overweight, and have another risk factor, you should also ask about testing.   If you have pre-diabetes you can often prevent or delay diabetes if you lose a modest amount of weight by cutting calories or increasing physical activity.   If you're overweight and lose just 5-7 percent of your body weight, you can lower diabetes onset by 58 percent. That's why early detection is so important.

Maria       July 5, 2016 4:23 p.m.   Excellent information. Type 2 diabetes runs in my family. My last blood test indicated that I am pre-diabetic. My doctor recommended that I continue taking my Pilates classes. I also lost 5-6 lbs. unfortunately I may be eating too many sweets.  I like a cookie or dark chocolate candy after lunch and dinner.  Would you like to comment?   Lanita Koster       July 5, 2016 4:10 p.m.   Excellent information, especially since my last blood test showed that I was pre-diabetic. My doctor recommended that I continue taking my Pilates classes which I'm doing. Since diabetes type 2 runs in my family, I also lost 6 lbs. I do eat sweets more than I should.   Lanita Koster       July 5, 2016 12:14 p.m.   I no longer eat flour or sugar and my blood sugar is dropping.  Now I am testing to see which foods are causing my blood sugar to spike.  I no longer eat oatmeal or blueberries because both of them spike my sugar.  It is an interesting project to test different foods.  I eat a lot of veggies and protein and fat.  Can't wait for the blood sugar to be under 100 on a consistent basis!!!!!!!!   Susan Lamborn       May 19, 2016 5:39 p.m.   Please give me a diet plan for pre diabetes.  Need help with this please.   J       October 8, 2015 2:44 p.m.   I got determined to have Type 2 Diabetes a year ago, and was put on Metformin. I took after the ADA diet 100% for a couple of weeks however it was inadequate at getting my glucose beneath 140. My Doctor was really incapable to the extent treatment alternatives went (Metformin until Insulin...). At that point I discovered the Diabetes Destroyer Book - http://qpreviews.com/diabetes-destroyer-review/ - made by David Andrews to assist you with making sense of how to beat diabetes normally, without being subject to drugs. Since taking after that convention I've lost more than 30 pounds and shaved 7 inches off my waist. I have more vitality than any time in recent memory, and can even work out twice around the same time when I have an inclination that it. I trust that more individuals start to open their eyes to the deadlock that is depending just on meds for Diabetes - there is a considerable measure of progress to be seen attempting common strategies.   Addakk       September 11, 2015 2:58 p.m.   I've been diagnosed with pre-diabetes. I also have high cholesterol. I believe that my Crestor has caused my blood sugar rise. Formerly, I had always had very low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia). I have not made any changes in my eating habits, other than watching red meats and fats. I try to avoid pasta, and bread, eating only those with a low glycemic index ( regular ones cause stomach bloat).  Reading the recipies for diabetics actually makes me nauseous, not to mention terrified. There is a lot of fish and veggies in these dishes. Mercury in local fish concerns me, as does the salmonella in veggies. How does one combat these issues along with the fact that I am allergic to shell fish and eggs, additionally, I  can't eat acidic fruits and veggies?   How do I come up with a diet that will work for me?   Valorie       July 7, 2015 3:37 p.m.   I am curious about previous comment by Sandy.  I am 79 years old and have an A1c of 5.6,  but it was 5.8  one year ago.  My HDL is very high (136), and my triglycerides are in the low normal range.  Does this sound like prediabes??  I exercise every day, am of normal weight (120 punds, 5 ft 2 in) and eat very,very little refined sugar and no sugar substitutes.  I only have bread once a week, and potatoes about the same. I do eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and meat and dairy.   Regina       July 7, 2015 11:47 a.m.   I am not overweight, have a low BMI, eat no sugar of any kind including fake sugars, diet is protein,vegetables and small amount of fruit. I exercise  regularly.  I do have a family history and was told I had it at 24. Also had it at pregnancy with both kids over 9 pounds.I have had it under control for years and now at 62 my A1C is 6.0-6.1. I do not want to get on meds. My HDL is high and triglycerides are very low. Is there anything I can do? Is A1C of 6 too high?

This is especially important if you're pregnant or nursing. ",http://www.mayo.edu/integrative-approaches-to-treating-pain/art-20208637,"Integrative approaches to treating pain       You've probably looked for pain relief from something more than just a pill. Maybe you've gotten a massage, tried biofeedback or added dietary supplements to your diet. These are forms of what used to be called complementary and alternative medicine.  Now, however, complementary and alternative medicine is most often referred to as integrative medicine.   Integrative medicine includes therapies that are used in addition to those used in conventional medicine, such as practicing yoga in addition to taking a prescription analgesic. Today the term ""integrative medicine"" is commonly used to describe health care practices and products that aren't generally part of conventional medicine but can be reasonably combined with conventional care.   Most of these integrative therapies aren't new. In fact, some  such as acupuncture and certain herbal remedies  have been around for thousands of years. These therapies are now experiencing a surge in popularity  especially when it comes to managing pain.   That's not surprising. Pain can leave you feeling helpless, with no control and at the mercy of the medications prescribed to you.  And although your prescriptions may be effective, you might struggle with side effects or fear the risks of increasing dosages or long-term use. Integrative therapies, on the other hand, can give you a broad range of philosophies and approaches to supplement the care your health care professional gives you, increase your relief from pain and improve your overall quality of life.     Combining conventional and unconventional care       The goal of integrative medicine is to treat the whole person  mind, body and spirit  not just an underlying disease. This can be accomplished by combining the best of conventional medicine with the best of less conventional practices  therapies that have a reasonable amount of high-quality evidence to support their use.   Researchers and health care professionals are finding that integrative medicine can provide positive outcomes for a broad range of pain causes. This is because pain is often a whole-body experience. Pain doesn't always come from just one source. There's the physical cause of the pain, of course  the injury, the joint pain, the muscle strain. But this physical pain can often be compounded by stress, frustration, fatigue, medication side effects and many other factors.   Conventional medicine typically only addresses physical pain. This is where integrative therapies can step in, to help with myriad other factors associated with pain. For example, a person who has knee surgery might be prescribed an analgesic to relieve post-surgery pain, visit a physical therapist to learn exercises to get moving again, and take a nutritional supplement to help with inflammation and joint health.     Are integrative pain therapies right for you?       You may wonder: Are integrative therapies safe? Could they actually work for me? Should I talk with my health care professional before using them?   These are all excellent questions. With their increasing popularity, more clinical research has been conducted on integrative therapies. Overall, the results are encouraging, and many conventional health care professionals are now incorporating integrative therapies that are supported by scientific studies into their practice of medicine.   Combined with conventional medicine, integrative approaches can help relieve pain and improve quality of life. Before you start any new treatment, however, do your research. Not all integrative therapies have been appropriately tested for safety and effectiveness.     Gather information.  Investigate specific therapies by viewing reputable websites and talking to your health care professional.   Use reputable therapy providers.  Only use providers who have professional credentials, or who come recommended by your health care professional.   Beware of interactions.  Ask whether any nutritional supplements you are considering taking might interfere with your over-the-counter or prescription medications.   Understand treatment costs.  Many integrative therapies aren't covered by health insurance.   Talk with your health care professional before trying something new.  This is especially important if you're pregnant or nursing.         Next   Share Tweet   July 26, 2016   References     Millman M, et al, eds. General symptoms.

They are needed in small amounts only and are available in the foods that you eat. Vitamin D is necessary for strong bones and teeth.   Lack of vitamin D may lead to a condition called rickets, especially in children, in which bones and teeth are weak. In adults it may cause a condition called osteomalacia, in which calcium is lost from bones so that they become weak. Your doctor may treat these problems by prescribing vitamin D for you. Vitamin D is also sometimes used to treat other diseases in which calcium is not used properly by the body.   Ergocalciferol is the form of vitamin D used in vitamin supplements.   Some conditions may increase your need for vitamin D. These include:       Alcoholism     Intestine diseases     Kidney disease     Liver disease     Overactivity of the parathyroid glands with kidney failure     Pancreas disease     Surgical removal of stomach      In addition, individuals and breast-fed infants who lack exposure to sunlight, as well as dark-skinned individuals, may be more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency. Increased need for vitamin D should be determined by your health care professional.   Alfacalcidol, calcifediol, calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol are forms of vitamin D used to treat hypocalcemia (not enough calcium in the blood). Alfacalcidol, calcifediol, and calcitriol are also used to treat certain types of bone disease that may occur with kidney disease in patients who are undergoing kidney dialysis.   Claims that vitamin D is effective for treatment of arthritis and prevention of nearsightedness or nerve problems have not been proven. Some psoriasis patients may benefit from vitamin D supplements; however, controlled studies have not been performed.   Injectable vitamin D is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Some strengths of ergocalciferol and all strengths of alfacalcidol, calcifediol, calcitriol, and dihydrotachysterol are available only with your doctor's prescription. Other strengths of ergocalciferol are available without a prescription. However, it may be a good idea to check with your health care professional before taking vitamin D on your own. Taking large amounts over long periods may cause serious unwanted effects.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Vitamin D is found naturally only in fish and fish-liver oils. However, it is also found in milk (vitamin Dfortified). Cooking does not affect the vitamin D in foods. Vitamin D is sometimes called the ""sunshine vitamin"" since it is made in your skin when you are exposed to sunlight. If you eat a balanced diet and get outside in the sunshine at least 1.5 to 2 hours a week, you should be getting all the vitamin D you need.   Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods. For example, fat is needed so that vitamin D can be absorbed into the body.   The daily amount of vitamin D needed is defined in several different ways.    For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      In the past, the RDA and RNI for vitamin D have been expressed in Units (U). This term has been replaced by micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D.   Normal daily recommended intakes in mcg and Units are generally defined as follows:    Information about this vitamin-d-and-related-compounds-oral-route-parenteral-route   Persons   U.S.   Canada     mcg   Units   mcg   Units     Infants and children birth to  3 years of age   7.5-10   300-400   510   200400     Children 4 to 6 years of age   10   400   5   200     Children7 to 10 years of age   10   400   2.55   100200     Adolescents and adults   510   200400   2.55   100200     Pregnant and breast-feeding  females   10   400   57.5   200300   Remember:       The total amount of each vitamin that you get every day includes what you get from the foods that you eat and what you may take as a supplement.     Your total amount should not be greater than the RDA or RNI, unless ordered by your doctor.

The body needs manganese for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough manganese in their regular diet or who have a need for more manganese, manganese supplements may be necessary. Manganese helps your body break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. It does so as part of several enzymes.   Manganese deficiency has not been reported in humans. Lack of manganese in animals has been found to cause improper formation of bone and cartilage, may decrease the body's ability to use sugar properly, and may cause growth problems.   Injectable manganese supplements are given by or under the supervision of a health care professional.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Manganese is found in whole grains, cereal products, lettuce, dry beans, and peas.   The daily amount of manganese needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Because a lack of manganese is rare, there is no RDA or RNI for it. The following daily intakes are thought to be plenty for most individuals:      Infants and children     Birth to 3 years of age: 0.3 to 1.5 milligrams (mg).     4 to 6 years of age: 1.5 to 2 mg.     7 to 10 years of age: 2 to 3 mg.         Adolescents and adults2 to 5 mg.

Por lo general, cuanto ms temprano nace un beb, ms alto es el riesgo de tener complicaciones. El peso al nacer es tambin muy importante.   Algunos problemas pueden manifestarse al momento del nacimiento mientras que otros pueden desarrollarse ms adelante.   Complicaciones a corto plazo   Durante las primeras semanas, las complicaciones de un parto prematuro comprenden:       Problemas respiratorios.  Un beb prematuro puede tener problemas para respirar ya que tiene un sistema respiratorio inmaduro. Si a los pulmones del beb les falta agente tensioactivo (una sustancia que les permite expandirse a los pulmones) puede padecer el sndrome de dificultad respiratoria ya que los pulmones no se pueden expandir y contraer con normalidad.   Los prematuros tambin pueden tener una enfermedad pulmonar crnica llamada displasia broncopulmonar. Adems, algunos prematuros experimentan pausas prolongadas en la respiracin, lo que se conoce como apnea.       Problemas de corazn.  Los problemas de corazn ms frecuentes que tienen los bebs prematuros son el conducto arterial persistente y la presin arterial baja (hipotensin). El conducto arterial persistente es una abertura constante entre los dos vasos sanguneos principales que salen del corazn.   Si bien este defecto del corazn a menudo se cierra solo, si no se trata puede hacer que haya mucha sangre para pasar a travs del corazn y puede producir insuficiencia cardaca y otras complicaciones. Para la presin arterial baja se pueden necesitar ajustes en lquidos intravenosos, medicamentos y, a veces, transfusiones de sangre.       Problemas cerebrales.  Cuanto ms temprano nace un beb, ms alto es el riesgo de sangrado en el cerebro, que se conoce como hemorragia intraventricular. La mayora de las hemorragias son leves y se resuelven con pocos efectos a corto plazo. Sin embargo, algunos bebs pueden tener sangrados cerebrales ms grandes, lo que causa una lesin cerebral permanente.   Los sangrados ms grandes pueden provocar que se acumule lquido en el cerebro (hidrocefalia) durante unas semanas. Algunos bebs que padecen hidrocefalia necesitarn una operacin para descargar el lquido acumulado.       Problemas de control de temperatura.  Los bebs prematuros pueden perder rpidamente el calor corporal; no tienen la grasa corporal almacenada de un beb que naci a trmino y no pueden generar calor suficiente como para contrarrestar lo que se pierde a travs de la superficie de sus cuerpos. Si la temperatura corporal baja demasiado, puede producirse hipotermia.   La hipotermia en un beb prematuro puede provocar problemas respiratorios y niveles bajos de azcar en la sangre. Adems, un beb prematuro suele usar toda la energa que obtiene de la alimentacin para mantener el calor y no para crecer. Por eso los bebs prematuros pequeos necesitan calor adicional de un calentador o una incubadora hasta que son ms grandes y pueden mantener la temperatura corporal sin ayuda.     Problemas gastrointestinales.  Los bebs prematuros son ms propensos a tener un aparato digestivo inmaduro, lo que los predispone a sufrir complicaciones como enterocolitis necrosante. Esta enfermedad, que puede llegar a ser grave y en la cual se daas las clulas que recubren la pared del intestino, puede ocurrir en bebs prematuros despus de comenzar a alimentarse. Los bebs prematuros que solo reciben leche materna tienen un riesgo mucho ms bajo de padecer enterocolitis necrosante.     Problemas sanguneos.  Los bebs prematuros tienen riesgos de tener problemas sanguneos como anemia e ictericia infantil. La anemia es una enfermedad frecuente en la que el cuerpo no tiene los glbulos rojos suficientes. Si bien todos los recin nacidos sufren una lenta disminucin de los glbulos rojos durante el primer mes de vida, la disminucin puede ser mayor en los prematuros, especialmente si al beb se le sac mucha sangre para anlisis de laboratorio.   La ictericia infantil consiste en un cambio de color en la piel y en los ojos del recin nacido, que se tornan amarillos, y ocurre porque la sangre del beb contiene en exceso un pigmento amarillo del hgado o los glbulos rojos (bilirrubina).     Problemas de metabolismo.  Los bebs prematuros a menudo tienen problemas de metabolismo. Algunos prematuros pueden tener un nivel anormalmente bajo de azcar en la sangre (hipoglucemia). Esto puede ocurrir porque los bebs prematuros generalmente tienen reservas ms pequeas de glucgeno (glucosa almacenada) que los bebs que nacen a trmino y porque el hgado inmaduro de los bebs prematuros tiene dificultades para transformar el glucgeno almacenado en glucosa.   Problemas del sistema inmunitario.  Un sistema inmunitario que no se desarroll por completo, lo que es frecuente en bebs prematuros, puede provocar infecciones. En un beb prematuro, una infeccin se puede extender con rapidez al torrente sanguneo y provocar septicemia, una enfermedad que puede poner en riesgo la vida.     Complicaciones a largo plazo   A largo plazo, un parto prematuro puede tener las siguientes complicaciones:     Parlisis cerebral infantil.  La parlisis cerebral infantil es un trastorno de movimiento, tono muscular o postura que puede deberse a una infeccin, un flujo sanguneo inadecuado o una lesin en el cerebro en desarrollo de un beb prematuro durante el embarazo o mientras el beb es pequeo e inmaduro.   Habilidades cognitivas alteradas.  En varios acontecimientos importantes del desarrollo, los bebs prematuros son ms propensos a retrasarse que los bebs que nacieron a trmino. En la edad escolar, un nio que naci prematuro ser ms propenso a tener problemas de aprendizaje.   Problemas de visin.  Los bebs prematuros pueden padecer retinopata del prematuro, una enfermedad que ocurre cuando los vasos sanguneos se hinchan y crecen en exceso en la capa de nervios sensibles a la luz en la parte posterior del ojo (retina). Algunas veces, los vasos anmalos de la retina la lastiman gradualmente y la desplazan de su lugar. Cuando la retina se sale de la parte posterior del ojo, se conoce como desprendimiento de retina, una enfermedad que, si no se detecta, puede deteriorar la visin y provocar ceguera.   Problemas de audicin.  Los bebs prematuros tienen un alto riesgo de sufrir algn grado de prdida de la audicin. A todos los bebs se les controla la audicin antes de que puedan irse a su hogar.   Problemas en los dientes.  Los prematuros que han estado gravemente enfermos tienen un alto riesgo de tener problemas en los dientes, como retraso en la salida de los dientes, prdida del color de los dientes y dientes mal alineados.   Problemas de conducta y psicolgicos.  Los bebs que nacieron de manera prematura son ms propensos que los nios que nacieron a trmino a tener ciertos problemas de conducta o psicolgicos, como trastorno de dficit de atencin con hiperactividad (TDAH). Sin embargo, estudios ms recientes sugieren que, por lo menos en los bebs prematuros tardos, el riesgo de sufrir trastorno por dficit de atencin con hiperactividad es el mismo que en los nios que nacieron a trmino.   Problemas crnicos de salud.  Los bebs prematuros son ms propensos a tener problemas crnicos de salud (algunos de los cuales requieren atencin hospitalaria) que los nios que nacieron a trmino. Hay ms posibilidades de que se manifiesten infecciones, asma y problemas de alimentacin o de que persistan. Los bebs prematuros tambin tienen un alto riesgo de padecer el sndrome de muerte sbita del lactante (SMSL).

It is usually present naturally in drinking water. However, some areas of the country do not have a high enough level in the water to prevent cavities. To make up for this, extra fluoride may be added to the diet. Some children may require both dietary fluoride and topical fluoride treatments by the dentist. Use of a fluoride toothpaste or rinse may be helpful as well.   Taking extra oral fluoride does not replace good dental habits. These include eating a good diet, brushing and flossing the teeth often, and having regular dental checkups.   Fluoride may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.   This medicine is available only with a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   People get needed fluoride from fish, including the bones, tea, and drinking water that has fluoride added to it. Food that is cooked in water containing fluoride or in Teflon-coated pans also provides fluoride. However, foods cooked in aluminum pans provide less fluoride.   The daily amount of fluoride needed is defined in several different ways.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      There is no RDA or RNI for fluoride. Daily recommended intakes for fluoride are generally defined as follows:   Infants and children      Birth to 3 years of age: 0.1 to 1.5 milligrams (mg).     4 to 6 years of age: 1 to 2.5 mg.     7 to 10 years of age: 1.5 to 2.5 mg.      Adolescents and adults      1.5 to 4 mg.      Remember:      The total amount of fluoride you get every day includes what you get from the foods and beverages that you eat and what you may take as a supplement.     This total amount should not be greater than the above recommendations, unless ordered by your health care professional. Taking too much fluoride can cause serious problems to the teeth and bones.

For patients who are unable to get enough molybdenum in their regular diet or who have a need for more molybdenum, molybdenum supplements may be necessary. They are generally taken by mouth in multivitamin/mineral products but some patients may have to receive them by injection. Molybdenum is part of certain enzymes that are important for several body functions.   A deficiency of molybdenum is rare. However, if the body does not get enough molybdenum, certain enzymes needed by the body are affected. This may lead to a build up of unwanted substances in some people.   Injectable molybdenum is administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional.

They are generally taken by mouth but some patients may have to receive them by injection. Copper is needed to help your body use iron. It is also important for nerve function, bone growth, and to help your body use sugar.   Lack of copper may lead to anemia and osteoporosis (weak bones).   Some conditions may increase your need for copper. These include:       Burns     Diarrhea     Intestine disease     Kidney disease     Pancreas disease     Stomach removal     Stress, continuing      Increased need for copper should be determined by your health care professional.   Claims that copper supplements are effective in the treatment of arthritis or skin conditions have not been proven. Use of copper supplements to cause vomiting has caused death and should be avoided.   Injectable copper is given by or under the supervision of a health care professional. Another form of copper is available without a prescription.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.   Copper is found in various foods, including organ meats (especially liver), seafood, beans, nuts, and whole-grains. Additional copper can come from drinking water from copper pipes, using copper cookware, and eating farm products sprayed with copper-containing chemicals. Copper may be decreased in foods that have high acid content and are stored in tin cans for a long time.   For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease      There is no RDA or RNI for copper. However, normal daily recommended intakes are generally defined as follows:       Infants and children     Birth to 3 years of age: 0.4 to 1 milligram (mg) per day.     4 to 6 years of age: 1 to 1.5 mg per day.     7 to 10 years of age: 1 to 2 mg per day.         Adolescent and adult males1.5 to 2.5 mg per day.     Adolescent and adult females1.5 to 3 mg per day.

Although a balanced diet usually supplies all the potassium a person needs, potassium supplements may be needed by patients who do not have enough potassium in their regular diet or have lost too much potassium because of illness or treatment with certain medicines.   There is no evidence that potassium supplements are useful in the treatment of high blood pressure.   Lack of potassium may cause muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, mood changes, or nausea and vomiting.   Injectable potassium is administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor. Some forms of oral potassium may be available in stores without a prescription. Since too much potassium may cause health problems, you should take potassium supplements only if directed by your doctor.   Importance of Diet    For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods.   The following table includes some potassium-rich foods.

For U.S.      Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).     Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).      For Canada      Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.      Because lack of potassium is rare, there is no RDA or RNI for this mineral. However, it is thought that 1600 to 2000 mg (40 to 50 milliequivalents [mEq]) per day for adults is adequate.   Remember:       The total amount of potassium that you get every day includes what you get from food and what you may take as a supplement. Read the labels of processed foods. Many foods now have added potassium.     Your total intake of potassium should not be greater than the recommended amounts, unless ordered by your doctor. In some cases, too much potassium may cause muscle weakness, confusion, irregular heartbeat, or difficult breathing.

Descubre cmo usar tensimetros caseros de manera precisa. By Mayo Clinic Staff       Controlar la presin arterial en el hogar es una parte importante en el manejo de la presin arterial alta (hipertensin).   La American Heart Association (Asociacin Americana del Corazn, AHA) y otras organizaciones recomiendan que las personas con presin arterial alta verifiquen su presin arterial en el hogar. La verificacin en el hogar puede ayudarte a controlar la presin arterial en un entorno familiar, mostrar si la medicacin funciona e incluso alertarte a ti y a tu mdico con respecto a posibles complicaciones.   Los tensimetros estn ampliamente disponibles y no requieren receta, por lo que la verificacin en el hogar es una medida sencilla para mejorar tu trastorno. Antes de empezar, es importante conocer la tcnica correcta y saber cmo encontrar un buen tensimetro.     Por qu es necesario que controle mi presin arterial en el hogar?       Controlarte la presin arterial en el hogar puede ofrecerte los siguientes beneficios:     Ayuda a realizar un diagnstico temprano.  El autocontrol puede ayudar al mdico a diagnosticar la presin arterial alta con anterioridad, en comparacin con las lecturas de la presin arterial ocasionales en el consultorio mdico. El control en el hogar tiene una importancia especial si tienes presin arterial ligeramente elevada (prehipertensin) u otra afeccin que pueda contribuir a tener presin arterial alta, como diabetes o problemas renales.   Ayuda a llevar un registro de tu tratamiento.  La nica manera de saber si los cambios en tu estilo de vida o los medicamentos funcionan es controlar la presin arterial de forma regular. Controlar los cambios en la presin arterial en el hogar puede ayudarles a ti y al mdico a tomar decisiones acerca de tu tratamiento, por ejemplo, con respecto al ajuste de las dosis o a los cambios en los medicamentos.   Fomenta un mejor control.  El autocontrol puede fortalecer tu sentido de la responsabilidad con respecto a la salud. Es posible que incluso te sientas ms motivado a controlar tu presin arterial con una dieta mejor, actividad fsica y el uso apropiado de medicamentos.   Reduce tus costos de cuidado de la salud.  El autocontrol podra ayudarte a reducir la cantidad de visitas que haces al mdico o a la clnica.   Controla si tu presin arterial es diferente fuera del consultorio del mdico.  Algunas personas tienen un aumento sbito de la presin arterial debido a la ansiedad asociada a la consulta con el mdico (hipertensin de consultorio). Otras personas tienen una presin arterial normal en la clnica, pero una elevada en otros lugares (hipertensin enmascarada). Controlar la presin arterial alta en el hogar puede ayudar a determinar si en verdad tienes presin arterial alta.     No todos pueden controlar la presin arterial en el hogar. Si tienes latidos del corazn irregulares, los tensimetros para el hogar podran no proporcionar una lectura precisa.     Tipos of tensimetros para el hogar       La mayora de las farmacias, tiendas de insumos mdicos y algunos sitios web vende tensimetros. Se recomienda que el dispositivo sea automtico o electrnico. Para elegir el mejor tensimetro para tu situacin, analiza las opciones con el mdico.   Por lo general, los tensimetros tienen los mismos componentes bsicos:     Brazalete inflable.  La capa interior del brazalete se llena de aire y presiona el brazo. La capa exterior del brazalete tiene una agarradera para mantenerlo en su lugar. La frecuencia cardaca y el flujo de sangre se calculan automticamente mediante la medicin de los cambios de movimiento de la arteria a medida que circula la sangre mientras el brazalete se desinfla.   Indicador de las lecturas.  Algunos tensimetros pueden realizar varias lecturas e indicar los valores promedio.     Por lo general, los tensimetros digitales que se ajustan a la parte superior del brazo son los ms precisos.   Si no encuentras un brazalete lo suficientemente grande para la parte superior de tu brazo, pregntale al mdico por un brazalete que puedas ajustar a la parte inferior del brazo o a la mueca. Este tipo de brazaletes puede ser difcil de usar correctamente. Pregntale al mdico si hay otras opciones y cmo deberas usarlas.   Los dispositivos que miden la presin arterial en el dedo no son recomendables.     Mquinas pblicas para medir la presin arterial       Las mquinas pblicas para medir la presin arterial, como las que se encuentran en las farmacias, pueden brindar informacin til sobre tu presin arterial, pero tienen sus limitaciones. La precisin de estas mquinas depende de varios factores, tales como el tamao adecuado del brazalete y el uso correcto de las mquinas. Solictale al mdico consejos acerca del uso de las mquinas pblicas para medir la presin arterial.       Next   Share Tweet   July 08, 2015   References     Bonow RO, et al.
