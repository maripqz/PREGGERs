Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.In a nutshell, her emphasis is on a division of responsibility.                 It is your job to put healthy, appropriate foods in front of your                 child at regular, predictable intervals. It is your childs job                 to choose what to eat and how much to eat. She says our culture                 has gotten so far away from trusting our kids to know what they                 are hungry for and when they are full. Thats not to say you fix                 whatever the child wants, or let them eat junk food exclusively.                 Its basically a solid-foods extension of breastfeeding on demand,                 rather than trying to get a baby to eat a set amount of food at                 a set time. You just offer regular meals and snacks, and trust your                 child to eat enough and balance out over the course of several days.                 She also addresses the issue of people only giving kids kid food                 like macaroni, chicken nuggets, hot dogs etc., instead of teaching                 them to gradually eat a variety of foods. Very readable and easy                 to understand, and good references to back it up!Secrets   of Feeding a Healthy Family         by Ellyn Satter         Kelcy   Press, Boulder CO         ISBN: 0967118905 Buy this bookcomments                 by BookerSecrets of Feeding a Healthy Family covers                 some of the same ideas as Child of Mine, but focuses more                 on food myths, the current cultural obsession with looking at foods                 as either something to avoid, or as medicine that you eat only                 for a specific health benefit. She takes a much looser approach,                 encouraging you to make meals enjoyable and tasty, eat a wide variety,                 and go ahead and include some fats to add flavor and appeal. She                 also looks into the problems with trying to strictly follow government                 guidelines, such as the food guide pyramid or RDAs, and how theyve                 contributed to some cultural misconceptions. She includes some recipes,                 samples of rotation menus, and nutrition information. This is as                 much about adult diets as children, while Child of Mine is                 specifically about children.  FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Nutrition for mom while pregnant & breastfeeding or tandem breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/04momnutrition/,"Special Dietary Considerations (Nursing & pregnant/Tandem nursing)Calcium (Nursing & pregnant/Tandem nursing)Nursing and pregnant (added calories)Tandem nursing (added calories) Remember that both pregnancy and lactation                 are   normal states for a womans body, not a medical condition. Special Dietary Considerations (Pregnant                 & Nursing or Tandem Nursing)If a mother is reasonably well-nourished her body can continue                 to meet her own needs and the needs of both her unborn child/infant                 and the older nursling. This is especially true if the older nursling                 is at least a year old when mom gets pregnant. In some cases, the                 health care provider may recommend that the mother consume more                 calories and/or take prenatal vitamins (but its unwise to                 take more than one a day). The only mothers who are likely to need special dietary consideration                 would be those who fall into the following categories:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.If the mother isConsideranemicirondairy-freecalciumveganvitamin B12taking supplemental ironadding zinc, too, but at a different time of dayunable to consume enough caloriesusing supplements to increase calorie intake, and decide if   reduced breastfeeding would be helpful When eating for three,                 who comes first? When the subject of breastfeeding during pregnancy comes up, it is often said that the mothers body gives first to the fetus, then to the nursling, and then to her own reserves. This may unintentionally be a bit misleading. First, we do not know how nutrients are partitioned between placenta and human milk production during times of nutritional stress. And secondly, you could take this to mean that your body will provide for your children to your own detriment. There is no reason to believe this is true for well-nourished mothers. Hilary Flower in Adventures in Tandem Nursing, p. 249CalciumPregnant and/or nursing mothers do not need additional calcium                 other than that normally required for their age group. The Institute                 of Medicine recommends that nursing mothers over the age of                 18 consume 1,000 mg. of calcium daily  the same as other adults.Hilary Flower researched this question for Adventures                 in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyond.                 She found three important facts that have come from the research                 of Dr. Ann Prentice in recent years:  Recovery of bone mineral density occurs BEFORE weaning. The recovery begins after the babys diet begins to be supplemented with other foods or liquids (the partial breastfeeding phase). By 12 months breastfeeding mothers have fully recovered their bone mineral density.  If a mother becomes pregnant before the recovery is complete, bone mineral density increases during pregnancy, a phenomonon not usually seen.  Mothers who are tandem nursing fare the same as their breastfeeding peers. Flower comments: Eventually popular beliefs will catch up                 to the scientific advances of the last five years, and breastfeeding                 mothers will no longer have to fend off admonishments that their                 bones are in jeopardy. For their part, scientists have moved on.                 (Adventures in Tandem Nursing, p.                 213) For more on calcium see Calcium.Nursing and pregnant (added calories)Most mothers find that if they simply eat to satisfy their increased                 hunger they can easily consume enough calories to support the pregnancy                 and continued lactation. Let your hunger and thirst dictate how                 much you take in. If you feel hungry, then you need to eat, regardless                 of how large the amounts may seem. Some mothers notice a decrease                 in appetite when milk supply decreases later into the pregnancy. You will want to gain weight just as you would if you were not                 nursing: 25-35 pounds is the current recommendation. See also What                 if I lose weight in the first trimester?Tandem nursing (added calories) A tandem nursing mother may need considerable calories, and the                 exact number will vary due to several factors:The percentage of breastmilk in the diets of the infant and older child. The more milk you are making, the more calories you will need. The Institute of Medicine estimates that a mother who is exclusively breastfeeding and does not have spare fat reserves will need an additional 650 calories; this same mother would need 500 additional calories for a baby aged 6-12 months who is getting solids. When nursing an older child who is getting less milk, calorie requirements would be proportionally less.Moms activity level, weight and nutritional status. A mother who is less active, has more fat stores from pregnancy, and/or eats foods higher in nutritional value may need fewer calories than a mom who is more active, has fewer fat stores, and eats more processed foods. As during pregnancy, let your appetite be your guide. If you are                 hungry, dont be afraid to eat two of every meal and snack                 constantly. Fatigue can be a sign of not getting enough calories.For research-based information on nutrition for mothers breastfeeding               during pregnancy and tandem nursing, see Adventures               in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyond by Hilary Flower.Nutrition topics covered include:Natural SafeguardsFirst, Lets Talk Quantity     (How large should your diet be?

Will breastfeeding affect the nutrition of my unborn child?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/03fetalnutrition/,"This concern is valid for malnourished mothers, but it does not appear to be grounded for well-nourished mothers. Although we do not yet have a medical study that can speak directly to the question for well-nourished mothers, we have two reasons to be quite encouraged:A survey of 57 mothers who had breastfed during some or all of pregnancy recorded that the babies born to these mothers had healthy birth weights (birth weights averaged 7 lb 9 oz, and ranged from 5 lb 9 oz  10 lbs 14 oz). (Moscone 1993)A recent review of the available research on breastfeeding and pregnancy as separate events revealed that as long as the mother is eating enough calories of a basic mixed diet, and as long as she is gaining weight within healthy parameters, there is ample reason to believe she can provide well for herself, her fetus and her nursling. (Adventures in Tandem Nursing, 2003)Kellys experience:Personally (and on the very nonscientific level), I nursed through my second pregnancy with no problems, and nursed both my son and daughter for 14 months. My son has always been very healthy and weighed 1.25 pounds more than my daughter did (whose pregnancy I did not nurse through)  he certainly didnt seem to lack any nutrition. He also did not lose any weight after birth, as most babies do.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I know many other mothers who have nursed through pregnancy and often went on to tandem nurse.

Nutrition for Breastfeeding Toddlers,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/toddler-foods/,"DeutschIt seems that all the the information I see regarding toddler nutrition assumes that your toddler is no longer breastfeeding and is eating mainly solids. As a result, many moms of breastfeeding toddlers (particularly those who are eating few solids) have lots of questions about how to adapt this information to their particular child.IntroductionCows milk?How much should my toddler be eating?Average toddler growthFeeding suggestions for toddlersAdditional informationIntroductionYour child can continue breastfeeding just as often during the second year, but offer solid foods a few times a day. After 12 months, you can begin offering the solids BEFORE baby nurses, if you wish, instead of after. Your milk is still an important part of babys diet and will offer him many benefits (nutritionally, immunilogically and emotionally). There is not any particular recommended number of times per day that a toddler should be nursing. Some are only nursing once or twice a day, while others continue to enjoy lots of time at their mothers breast. As baby slowly moves into eating more solids, your milk will fill any nutritional gaps nicely. Once you do start to breastfeed less often, remember that you must make a greater effort to ensure that your child eats several meals of nutritious food each day.Cows milk?Many nursing moms are told that they must introduce cows milk at a year. Your nursing toddler is already getting the best milk he can get  mothers milk! Breastmilk has a higher fat content than whole cows milk (needed for babys brain growth), and all the nutrients of human milk are significantly more bioavailable than those of cows milk because it is species specific (not to mention all the components of mothers milk that are not present in cows milk).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.There is no need to add cows milk to your toddlers diet (or the equivalent nutrients from other milks or foods) as long as your baby is nursing at least 3-4 times per day. Cows milk is really just a convenient source of calcium, protein, fats, vitamin D, etc.  its not required. There are many people in many parts of the world who do not drink milk and still manage to get all the calcium, protein, fats, vitamin D, etc. that they need.Good non-dairy sources of protein include meats, fish, peas & beans (chick peas, lentils, baked beans, etc.), tofu and other soy products, boiled eggs, peanut and other nut butters (if your child is not allergic).Good non-dairy sources of fats include soy and safflower oils, flax seed and flax seed oil, walnuts, fish and fish oils, avocado. Adding fats to cooking and baking can work well, for example, stir fry in safflower oil or make mini-muffins with soy or rice milk, oil or butter, and eggs.Calcium may be derived from many nondairy sources.Vitamin D can be supplied by sunlight exposure and food sources.If your child is not nursing regularly and is not allergic to cows milk products, but simply doesnt like cows milk, you can incorporate milk into your childs diet in other ways. Many children like cheese, whole-fat yogurt or ice cream. You can also put milk into various food products: pancakes, waffles, muffins, French toast, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, and baked goods.Some moms wish to offer cows milk to their toddler, but baby doesnt like it. Over the age of 12 months, milk becomes a more minor part of a childs diet. It is sometimes helpful to mix increasing amounts of cows milk with your expressed milk to help baby get used to the taste. Many dietitians see nothing wrong with adding some flavor (such as strawberry or chocolate) to cows milk.Pediatricians now recommend that any cows milk be whole milk from a cup after the first year and until the child is at least 2 years of age. This ensures that your child receives enough fat, which is essential to proper brain development. After the age of two, if growth is good, you can switch to low-fat or nonfat milk. Note: If your child is nursing, then remember that moms milk is whole milk  the more breastmilk your child gets, the less need to worry about your child getting additional fat from whole milk or other sources.Its best to limit the amount of cows milk that your child receives to 2-3 cups (16-24 ounces) per day, since too much cows milk in a childs diet can put him at risk for iron-deficiency anemia (because cows milk can interfere with the absorption of iron) and may decrease the childs desire for other foods.How much should my toddler be eating?Between ages one and five, a childs growth is in a decelerated stage; that is, they have slowed down in growth. Since growth slows down, their need for calories subsequently decreases, which in turn leads to a smaller quantity of food ingested per day. Added to the decelerated growth is a burgeoning independence which limits the variety of foods your child is willing to eat (finicky eater). Rest assured that toddlers do not need as much food as you might expect because of this slowing down of the growth rate. Three small meals and two snacks a day (and some will eat a good bit less) will probably be enough to fuel even the most active toddler. Please realize, too, that finicky eaters are the rule rather than the exception.Some toddlers are eating very few solids, or even no solids, at 12 months. This is not unusual and really depends on your child  there is quite a big variation. We like to see breastmilk making up the majority (around 75%) of babys diet at 12 months. Some babies will be taking more solids by 12 months, but others will still be exclusively or almost-exclusively breastfed at this point. It is normal for baby to keep breastmilk as the primary part of his diet up until 18 months or even longer. An example of a nice gradual increase in solids would be 25% solids at 12 months, 50% solids at 18 months, and 80% solids at 24 months.Some children take a little longer to begin taking solids well. Some of them have food sensitivities and this may be their bodys way of protecting them until their digestive system can handle more. Others are late teethers or have a lot of difficulty with teething pain. At this point there is NOTHING that your milk lacks that your child needs, with the possible exception of enough iron. As long as his iron levels are within acceptable levels and when he does eat you are offering him foods naturally rich in iron, then you have plenty of time before you need to worry about the amount of solids hes getting.All you need to do is to continue to offer foods. Dont worry if hes not interested or takes very small amounts. Your only true responsibility is what you offer, when you offer it and how you offer it, not whether or not he eats it. That has to be up to him. Trying to force, coax, or cajole your child into eating is never recommended. Continue to nurse on demand, day and night, and trust your child to increase the solids when hes ready. As baby slowly moves into eating more solids, your milk will fill any nutritional gaps nicely.Average toddler growthsee Average Toddler GrowthFeeding suggestions for toddlersFinger foods are always great for toddlers, and your toddler will also begin to learn how to feed himself with a spoon and fork. Many babies prefer to eat foods which they can pick up and feed themselves, rather than foods that must be spooned to them. A lot of babies would rather have food right off the table than the blander-tasting baby foods.After the age of twelve months, continue to be on the lookout for any allergic reactions to new foods and keep in mind that the choking hazard is still very real. Supervise your toddlers meals in case of choking, and continue to avoid foods such as popcorn, hard candies, hot dogs, jelly beans, chunks of carrots, grapes, raisins, and nuts. Cut or finely chop such foods, or simply wait until your baby gets older.Toddlers should be offered a variety of foods. They can eat the same things as the rest of the family. Foods rich in protein, calcium, and iron, along with fruits and vegetables, breads, etc. should be made available on a routine basis. Serve the most healthful foods possible, but dont expect your toddler to eat a big meal at each sitting. Most children, when offered nutritious meals and snacks and allowed to eat what they wish, will meet their nutritional requirements over several days or even a week. Dont let your child fill up on empty-calorie snacks, but dont force him to eat when he doesnt want to.Many toddlers eat better when they have food available throughout the day, rather than just at a few set times (see grazing). Simply offer your toddler nutrient-dense snacks throughout the day (cut-up vegetables, bite-sized pieces of fruit, hard-boiled-egg slices, yogurt, whole wheat breads and cereals, cheeses) and let him eat what he wants. Some parents have had good luck with Dr. William Sears suggestion of a nibble tray, where you fill a tray (like an ice cube tray, muffin tin, etc.) with several types of healthy foods and leave it out for your toddler to nibble on throughout the day.Check out the current USDA daily food guide for preschoolers (ages 2-6).Additional informationFeeding the Picky Eater by William Sears, MDIs your child getting enough to eat?

Meet Our Sponsor: Theralogix,http://kellymom.com/current-sponsor/meet-sponsor-theralogix/,"Our sponsor for the month is Theralogix. They would like to introduce you to their latest product TheraNatal Lactation One postnatal vitamin supplement. You want to give your baby whats best  your pure breast milk and nothing more.Breastfeeding is one of the best things you can do to support your babys health, and good nutrition plays a key role in your babys growth and development. Nutrient needs during breastfeeding are different than at any other time in a womans life.Research has continuously shown that one specific nutrient is very important for your babys overall growth and development. That nutrient is vitamin D.The amount of vitamin D found naturally in breast milk is too low to prevent vitamin D deficiency in most breastfed infants. Breast milk is generally low in vitamin D because it is difficult to consume adequate vitamin D through diet alone. Moreover, most women are not exposed to enough sunlight each day for their breast milk to contain the appropriate amount of vitamin D for baby.As a result, The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving breastfed babies 400 IU vitamin D drops each day. As many moms would agree, giving vitamin D drops can be difficult for a variety of reasons. In fact, research has shown that less than 20% of families follow the recommendation to give vitamin D drops each day, increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency in their babies.1,2A recent study asked breastfeeding moms if they would prefer to take vitamin D themselves rather than give their babies a supplement. An overwhelming majority (88%) of breastfeeding moms reported they would rather supplement themselves than give their babies vitamin D drops.3As a new mom you have enough to do without adding vitamin D drops to the list. Moreover, many moms do not like the artificial flavors and dyes found in most infant vitamin D drops. You want to give your baby whats best; your pure breast milk and nothing more.Ground breaking research by Dr. Bruce Hollis (see KellyMoms interview) concluded that breastfeeding mothers could supplement themselves daily with 6,400 IU of vitamin D from a dietary supplement in order to provide enough vitamin D to their babies through their breast milk alone.4This is important because it gives nursing mothers a safe, simple alternative to drops.Introducing TheraNatal Lactation One.TheraNatal Lactation One, from Theralogix, was developed specifically to meet the unique nutrient needs of both mom and baby during breastfeeding  eliminating the need for infant vitamin D drops.Most moms do not want totake unnecessary supplements and would rather rely on a healthy diet for their nutrition.

When you are in the act of breastfeeding, you are in it. Nursing a baby takes hold of your focus and demands your complete attention. You wake up thinking of latching and timing, right side or left, the amount of needed ounces. You nurse and nurse and nurse, and sometimes pump, and then you go to bed  briefly  often worrying about lack of sleep, sore nipples and the production of enough milk (or of too much milk).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Your life is dictated by the nursing needs of your wee one and breast milk and the logistics around feeding: nurse before you leave or on the way, pump now or later, dream feed or wait and see. What you see is purely the little one before you and the boob because thats how it has to be. What you cant see, is what breastfeeding looks like beyond you and the baby and the boob. (You dont have time, you are just getting from feed to feed, from day to day.)But I can see. Its working women and stay-at-home women. Young women and older women. First time timid women and fifth child on-the-boob-while-vacuuming women. Its women in every part of the country, every corner of the world. Its with your baby or without. Its for your baby or your sisters baby or a baby youve never met. Its one-day-olds and one week olds and two month-olds and two-and-a-half-year-olds. Its hooked up to one baby or two, to a hand pump or a mechanical pump that sounds like Darth Vadar. Its sitting in parks and hospitals and bedrooms and subway cars and pizza joints and airplane seats and bathroom stalls. Its easy and impossible. Its nothing like you planned. Its better than you expected. Its loaded with feelings; its connection and sometimes guilt. Its beautiful. Its sweaty. Its magical. Its a lot of work. Its empowering yet sometimes deflating (just like breastfeeding boobs). Its bittersweet when it ends. Its very, very personal and unique each time. Its between a mama and a baby but sometimes intruded upon by someone else in the world. Its talked about in the media way too much but not enough in our homes. Its thankfully surrounded by doulas and midwives and lactation consultants and best friends. Its also accompanied by the occasional stares.Its really stinking cool. Its a journey and a transformation, a form of nutrition and a little comfort. Its not for everyone. Its not forever. It just is.This is all breastfeeding today.When it comes to breastfeeding, Ive been in it. Ive been touched by it. Drained by it. Elevated by it. Paranoid about it. And fortunate enough to experience it twice. Ive seen the good in it and faced the challenges it brings. Ive nursed in many-a-public venues and pumped in about 40 places (even at 40,000 feet up). Ive learned that these boobs were made for nursing but the world wasnt always made for us and our hard-working boobs and Ive decided its time to change that. Im convinced that by paying attention to the acts of breastfeeding all around us we can create a more supportive world for nursing mothers. We can drive more stories of positive experiences and optimism. We can smile  rather than stare  at nursing mothers. We can offer more resources, more mothering rooms, more time off to get the hang of nursing. Its the reason why Ive created pumpspotting. pumpspotting is an app and a community. Its a place for all breastfeeding moms to come together to support one another, to chat, to interact, and to laugh. Its a bright light in a world of bathroom stalls and broom closets. It was made to bring us breastfeeding women together and to help bring awareness to the places we nurse and pump. Think of it as Facebook meets Yelp meets boob. Its global, its uplifting, and its completely powered by mamas. Its everything I wished I had in the palm of my hand while nursing. I hope youll join me on the app and as part of the community and that together well successfully navigate this world of nursing.Warmly,Amy Ready to join the boob-venture?

A message from our sponsor: Doing Our Part for Prematurity Awareness Month,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/message-sponsor-part-prematurity-awareness-month/,"Our sponsor for the month is AmedabyRen R. Fisher, BA, IBCLC,RLC Ameda, Professional Sales SpecialistEvery year, 1 in 10 babies are born prematurely. November marks Prematurity Awareness Month, shining a bright light on babies born before 37 weeks and the special challenges they face. For over 75 years, Ameda has been dedicated to helping moms express their milk. Never has this been more important than when supporting the mothers of premature babies, where breast milk acts not just as nutrition but also as potentially life-saving medicine.A mothers milk is the best choice for her baby. For NICU babies, breast milk is dose-dependent; the more they get, the better off they are. Pre-term milk has a different make-up than full-term milkthere are several differences in enzymes and protein levels when the two are comparedand offers a number of benefits to a premature baby. It helps to minimize infections, lower the rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and improve vision (among other benefits). It also significantly lowers the risk of more serious infections such as Necrotizing Enterocolotis (NEC), an intestinal disease that affects mostly premature formula-fed infants.A mother also benefits from providing her pre-term baby with breast milk. Emotionally, she may be stressed by a potentially unexpected early birth and possibly traumatic birth experience. Amongst the chaos, she may feel helpless watching her baby lay in the NICU, especially if shes not allowed to hold her child very often or at all. Expressing the milk that will be fed to her baby gives her the opportunity to provide one of the most important things her child needs in these early critical days.While a mothers milk is the preferred food for her baby, she will need to transfer the milk from her body to the infant. Biologically, her body starts to make milk immediately following birth but needs stimulation to continue and establish her milk supply. Additionally, many preterm infants are unable to suck and latch. Because there is a two-week window for a mothers body to establish her supply, its important to find a way to stimulate the mother, the earlier the better, with either a baby or a breast pump.A pump like the Ameda Platinum Breast Pump mimics a nursing babys suck in order to stimulate a mothers body to establish and maintain a milk supply. Babies change sucking speed an average of four times per feeding to achieve multiple milk ejections during a breastfeeding session. The Ameda Platinum pump has control over how fast the pump is sucking and, simulating the speed changes of a baby, empowers her to follow her flow.A mothers comfort while pumping is very important as it will help her drain her breasts more effectively. The Platinum allows the mom to incrementally adjust the pumps suction to her highest comfortable setting, which is also where she will realize the highest milk production. These individual speed and suction controls create a personalized experience unique to each mother. The internal rotating piston on the Ameda Platinum also ensures a very smooth waveform for suction, building and releasing pressure smoothly and evenly.A serious threat to NICU babies comes in the form of bacteria and infection. All Ameda breast pumps use the HygieniKit Milk Collection System, a closed, FDA-approved barrier system that prevents milk or moisture from entering the tubing. For nursing and pumping mothers, we have eliminated the possibility of contamination from or into the tubing, which not only protects the baby but also eliminates the need to inspect and clean it.Expressing a mothers milk is only half the process. The other half is getting the milk into the baby, especially since some NICU babies may not eat by mouth but be fed by a tube directly into their stomach. Its standard for NICU moms to pump milk and then either refrigerate it for a few days or freeze it. But a premature babys digestive tract is sensitive to temperature, so its important to ensure that their feedings are warmed to the proper body temperature. Over-warming the milk can damage its nutrients; under-warming it makes it more difficult for a baby to digest and forces them to use precious extra calories to process it. Exercise care when warming the milkusing a microwave is not recommended and, since its difficult to know the temperature to which the milk is heated, using a cup of hot water should be avoided as it increases the risk of overheating and damaging nutrients. A warmer like Amedas Penguin Nutritional Warmer is a system that heats feedings. The Penguin utilizes a thermal liner that circles the bottle or feeding vessel, to bring the feeding to body temperature in a consistent and trusted way. For a NICU mom, the peace of mind a warming system offers is invaluable.Regardless of how a NICU baby is fed, they and their mothers need unwavering support and understanding in order to be successful. Ameda is proud to continue our tradition of putting mothers and babies first by offering breastfeeding education and products that contribute to the care of our most fragile babies.Amedas website offers helpful videos and educational information for both the mother and the staff who care for her and her baby.FacebookPinterestTwitter"

"Vitamin D and Breastfeeding: An interview with Bruce Hollis, PhD",http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-d-and-breastfeeding/,"Dr. Bruce Hollis is the lead author of a 2015study that concluded that supplementing the mothers ofexclusively breastfed babieswith 6400 IU vitamin Dper dayis a safe and effective alternativetodirectly supplementing babies with 400 IU vitamin D per day.When Theralogix, one of our sponsors, told us Dr. Hollis is on their advisory board, I asked if he would be interested in doing an interview to discuss vitamin D and breastfeeding.I hope you find his information useful!Why is vitamin D important for infants?Vitamin D is absolutely critical to the human infant in order to maintain skeletal integrity. Recent research also tells us that vitamin D is key in the maintenance of our immune systems regulating both infection and inflammatory pathways.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.What are the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) about vitamin D? Do other countries have similar recommendations?The AAP recommends that all children (birth through adolescence) receive 400 IU vitamin D per day. Canada has similar recommendations (with greater amounts recommended in winter for those in more northern regions). Vitamin D recommendations in European countries vary.How much vitamin D does breastmilk usually contain? Why?Human breastmilk is a very poor source of vitamin D, usually containing less than 50 IU per quart. This is why the AAP recommends all breastfed infants receive 400 IU per day vitamin D by supplement drops. This IS NOT A DEFECT IN BREAST MILK but a defect in the recommended amount of vitamin D the lactating mom should be taking. If a mom takes 6400 IU per day, she will supply her nursing infant with plenty of vitamin D thru her milk and will not need to give her infant drops.Are there problems with using vitamin D drops to supplement baby?There is no problem with the drops per se, only that they are inconvenient and mothers oftentimes just dont give them. In our hands, only about 15% of moms adhere to these recommendations. Worse, some moms are never told to give them by their pediatrician, which we would consider malpractice given the problems that can arise by not doing so.Are all mothers and babies at risk for vitamin D deficiency? What are the risk factors?Practically everyone is at risk for vitamin D deficiency with, ironically, only formula-fed infants being safe. This is because infant formula contains 400 IU per quart vitamin D.Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include limited exposure to sunlight (due to far northern latitudes, urban areas with tall buildings and/or air pollution that block the sun, limited time outdoors, etc.) and darker skin pigmentation (which requires more sun exposure to generate an adequate amount of vitamin D).Is it possible to get enough vitamin D through sun exposure, without adding a supplement?Yes, though it is harder to get enough exposure in the winter, during any season in far northern areas, or if you have darker skin pigmentation. Vitamin D deficiency is relatively common even in sunny climates like the southern United States. Tanning in a tanning booth on a regular basis would probably give you adequate vitamin D levels (but this comes with its own health risks). Most find that taking a supplement is simpler.Is there a specific test or tests that should be requested if a mother is concerned about her or her babys vitamin D levels?Vitamin D3 is the type of vitamin D our bodies generate when our skin is exposed to UVB rays from the sun, and is the supplement generally recommended (vitamin D2 is sometimes used, also). Vitamin D (whether taken in the diet or generated in the skin) is transformed within the body to its active form, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). 25(OH)D is easier to measure, and this is what is generally measured in lab tests for vitamin D.To test for deficiency, anyone can have their blood levels of 25(OH)D checked. However, testing can getexpensive, and if one takes the amount of vitamin D we are recommending a deficiency would be non-existent.If you would like to check your vitamin D levels, you can request the test from your health care provider oruse a blood spot home test kit(for example, the Vitamin D Council has a good home test kit).What is considered a normal level of 25(OH)D in the blood? This varies depending on who you ask. The Institute of Medicineconsiders 20-30 ng/ml to be adequate for most of the population. The Endocrine Societysuggests that 30-100 ng/ml will result in a vitamin D sufficiency. The Vitamin D Councilsuggests 40-80 ng/ml as a sufficient vitamin D level. Based upon my experience and research, I personally feel that 50-70 ng/ml should be considered a normal level of 25(OH)D in the blood.Note:Vitamin D amounts and 25(OH)D levels in blood are reported with severaldifferent units of measure, so the numbers can get confusing. We use ng/ml here for blood levels, but another common unit of measure is nmol/l.To convert, 1 nmol/l = 2.5 ng/ml.So20 ng/ml = 50 nmol/l30 ng/ml = 75 nmol/lOther measurements commonly used:1g=2.5nmol2.5g= 6.25 nmol =100IU10g = 25 nmol = 400 IUIf a breastfeeding mother knows that her vitamin D blood level is normal does that mean her milk will contain enough vitamin D?NO! The 25(OH)D in your blood is not a good reflection of the amount of vitamin D that is available to pass into breastmilk. They are two different compounds. Since Vitamin D (rather than the active metabolite 25(OH)D) is the form that passes into a mothers milk, the only sure way to know it is there is to take it every day.Tell us about your vitamin D study. How long ago did you start the NIH-funded study?The grant project began in July of 2006 and concluded in 2014.How was the study conducted?It was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial that was conducted at two medical centers, The Medical University of South Carolina and the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY.What were the findings?The findings, published in October 2015, can be read in detail in the journal Pediatrics(the official journal of The AAP). Simply, what we found was that infants achieved the same blood level of 25(OH)D whether they received vitamin D directly as drops (400 IU per day) or via breastfeeding from mothers receiving 6,400 IU per day vitamin D a quite remarkable finding, indeed.Are your findings applicable to mothers & babies worldwide?These findings would be universal to all lactating mothers worldwide.The Institute of Medicine has set the upper limit of recommended intake at 4000 IU. Is it safe for an adult to take 6400 IU?The IOM setting a limit of 4,000 IU per day was subjective and not based on any trials. The Endocrine Society guidelines state that 10,000 IU per day is safe. In my own experience with our trial and several other trials in which I have been involved (involving tens of thousands of patients), not a SINGLE adverse event has been observed due to vitamin D intake. I personally take 6,000 IU per day and have for years, and my daughter just had a child and is taking 10,000 IU per day while lactating (going on a year now). Totally safe.Does an adult taking 6400 IU per day need to have vitamin D levels monitored?Not unless you like to waste your money.Is it possible for a baby to get too much vitamin D through breast milk?I suppose it is possible, if the mother is consuming 100,000 IU per day or more.If a woman starts to supplement with formula or solid food, should she reduce her vitamin D dose?I recommend everyone take at least 5,000 IU per day for disease prevention, so I would suggest that mothers continue taking 6400 IU per day throughout lactation.Are there any medical conditions that might interfere with vitamin D transfer into milk?Some conditions can interfere with your own absorption of vitamin D (e.g., obesity, fat malabsorption issues, certain medications, or other issues could mean that you need to supplement with greateramountsof vitamin D to achieve sufficient levels in your blood), but these should not interfere with the transfer of vitamin D from your blood into breastmilk.Do you have any suggestions for discussing a vitamin D supplementation plan with the mothers and babys health care providers?Find an open-minded health care providerwho is not totally wedded to what they were taught in medical school or who blindly follows what a given organization such as the AAP recommends. If yours is not, and will not listen to you if you present them with facts, find a different one.Do you have anything else to add that could be useful for our readers?Again, be educated and present your doctor with ideas if they are resistant or arrogant, move on.I have seen many cases where a pediatrician failed to even inform the mother that she needed to give a vitamin D supplement to her breastfeeding infant. Subsequently, the infant developed fractures (due to vitamin D deficiency) and the parents were charged with child abuse. I receive a case a month involving this type of scenario. If these pediatricians were charged with medical malpractice, this type of scenario would soon end.Thefollowingvideos are quite good.Dr. Michael Greger has read the recent literature and condensed it into a set of 4-minute videos for the general public:Will You Live Longer if You Take Vitamin D Supplements?by Michael Greger, MDHow much vitamin D should you take?by Michael Greger, MDThe Optimal Dose of Vitamin D Based on Natural Levelsby Michael Greger, MDThe Best Way to Get Vitamin D: Sun, Supplements, or Salons?by Michael Greger, MDArabic translation of this article (posted as a series of images on Facebook).

What do I need to know about the WHO Code?,http://kellymom.com/bf/advocacy/what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-who-code/,"Publications from www.ibfan-icdc.orgThe WHO Code (or simply, The Code) is a short name for theInternational Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, which was adopted by the World Health Assembly and UNICEF in 1981. Since that time, a number of resolutions have also been passed toclarify and addto the Code.The Code is a marketing code that aimsto protect breastfeeding, to protect allmothers and babies (whether breastfeeding, formula-feeding or combination feeding)and to prevent aggressive marketing practicesthat oftenprevent mothers from meeting their own breastfeeding goals. Infant formula, feeding bottles, and artificial nipples are the main products that fall within the scope of the Code. Pacifiers and breast pumps are not under the scope of the Code. Note that the Code only applies to the marketing of these items it does not affect whether they are sold or used.Is theCodeintended to make parents who use formula feel guilty?No!The Codeis primarily aimed at governments andcompanies.Health care workers and facilities also have a role to play.The aim of this Code is to contribute to the provision of safe and adequate nutrition for infants, by the protection and promotion of breastfeeding, and by ensuring the proper use of breastmilk substitutes, when these are necessary, on the basis of adequate information and through appropriate marketing and distribution.  Article 1 of the CodeIt is not directed at parents.It does not advocate against parents choosing to use formula.It does require that parents be given complete and factual information about infant feeding including, whenapplicable, how to properly and safely prepare infant formula.It does not suggest that formula sales to the public should be limited.It does require that infant formula meet strict quality standards, that the label include clear instructions for safe preparation, and that inappropriate foods (such as cannedmilk, rice milk, etc.) not be advertised for use as the sole source of nourishment for babies.It does say that companiesshould stopmarketing practices that undermine breastfeeding and prevent mothers from meeting their own breastfeeding goals.It does say that, instead of advertising hype, parents who use formula shouldreceiveunbiased, factual information.More informationUnderstanding the International Code (IBFAN)A Summary of the WHO Code (including WHERE, WHAT, WHEN and HOW) (Snugabell)What is the WHO-CODE?

Breastfeeding the Type 1 Diabetic Child,http://kellymom.com/health/baby-health/breastfeeding-type-1-diabetes-child/,"by Erin Hayden-Baldauf, MSEd, IBCLC, CD(DONA)Image courtesy of Lisa Williams / flickr.comAs an IBCLC with roughly ten years of breastfeeding support experience, and four breastfed children of my own, I felt pretty confident over the years in my ability to manage breastfeeding obstacles as they presented themselves  both my own, and those of the women I worked with. That is until my youngest child, still a nursling, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the young age of fifteen months. What I, and many other unfortunate mothers have found, is that there is no real data-driven literature available to support continued breastfeeding with a type 1 diabetic infant or toddler, and nothing to help guide the practice in a healthy and manageable way. At this time, I am only able to synthesize personal experience and knowledge with what I have learned from scientific research in the disconnected fields of diabetes management and lactation. It is my hope, that in time, the need for research specifically related to the care of diabetic nurslings will be conducted to further this analysis. Until then, my wish is for this article to open up a dialogue regarding not only the safety, but the importance of continued breastfeeding through a diabetes diagnosis.There are basically two categories of children that this concern applies to: those that are still exclusively breastfed, and those that are receiving part of their caloric intake from breastmilk, with a supplement of nutrients and calories from solid foods or formula. For the most part, the former are generally infants under the age of six months. I have not come across any mothers who have been pressured to wean their exclusively breastfed infant within the first six months of age, but should a mother find herself in this unique situation, she can refer her doctor to the article in Pediatrics & Child Health entitled The infant and toddler with diabetes: Challenges of diagnosis and management written by a well versed team of doctors, nurses, and other experts in the field, in which the authors state that In the youngest infants, particularly those who are still breastfeeding, the injections are given about twelve hours apart and in older children before breakfast and supper. As the children grow older, they are switched to a three-times daily injection routine (Daneman et al.). This statement indicates that breastfeeding a diabetic nursling is in no way contraindicated and simply addresses the fact that as with all diabetic children, the care plan will be constantly changing and evolving as the child grows. The plan can just as easily accommodate a diet of breastmilk as that of formula. According to the World Health Organization, exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is the optimal way of feeding infants. Thereafter infants should receive complementary foods with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond (Exclusive Breastfeeding. WHO). The guideline of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months is also supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP Reaffirms Breastfeeding Guidelines). There is no reason this guideline should be changed for children with a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. This will be explained in more detail in the section below.As for the second category, babies and toddlers over the age of six months who are fed a combination of breastmilk and solids, I have heard from too many mothers (not to mention my own experiences) reporting pressure to abruptly wean. Rationale for abrupt weaning focuses on the misconception that breastmilk is too difficult to calculate in terms of carbohydrate counting. The fact (the absolutely beautiful fact) is that breastmilk is always changing to meet the changing needs of the baby  from day to day, week to week, and even hour to hour. According to Ann Prentice, and The United Nations University Press, The composition of breastmilk is not uniform, and the concentrations of many of its constituents change during the lactation period and differ between individual mothers. Sometimes it is higher in water, other times it is higher in fat and protein. While this wonderfully organic nature of breastmilk may concern those trying to manage the care of a child whose health and well-being strongly rely on a careful calculation of carbohydrate intake, it is important to note that while protein, fat, micro, and macronutrients may vary, Some components show little change, especially those involved in osmoregulation, including lactose [the primary carbohydrate in breastmilk] and sodium. The author does distinguish between the composition of colostrum through day 5 and mature milk, noting that lactose in mature milk is slightly higher than that of colostrum (approximately 7.5 g in 100ml/roughly 3.3 oz of mature milk, vs. 5.3 g in 100ml/roughly 3.3 oz of colostrum) (Prentice). For the purposes of addressing the needs of the older infant/toddler, this means that the childs care team can safely assume mature milk to consistently comprise of roughly 2.25 grams of carbohydrates per single ounce of milk. While this is very valuable information, it doesnt address the concern that some teams may have regarding the difficulty in measuring exact intake when a child nurses directly at the breast. For this reason, some doctors allow the mother to continue feeding the child breastmilk, but urge her to feed the milk through a bottle so that intake can be carefully monitored.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.While the push to have mother switch to a pumping/bottle-feeding routine may seem benign (possibly even ideal) as baby still receives the nutritional and immunological benefits of mothers milk while allowing for more precise monitoring, it is important to take into consideration a cost-benefits analysis when making such a recommendation. At the most basic level, pumping and bottle-feeding is much more work than directly nursing at the breast. At a time when parents are taking on so many new tasks and responsibilities to care for their child, adding complexity to an otherwise simple feeding method adds to already heightened stress and sets the breastfeeding mother up for failure. Aside from this very real drawback to switching, it is also important to consider the fact that breastfed babies often breastfeed for more than nutritional reasons. When weighing the physical and emotional risks associated with abrupt weaning (such as added stress and anxiety for both nursling and mother, as well as the potential for physical complications such as plugged ducts and mastitis in the mother) during an already highly stressful time, it is important to assess the real value of such a major shift in the childs feeding routine.While careful monitoring of carbohydrate intake is important to the care of a newly diagnosed diabetic child, it is generally agreed upon that complications associated with slightly elevated blood sugars are less concerning for young children, than the risks of low blood sugars, which is why pediatric endocrinologists tend to prefer letting babies and toddlers run high; often not advising correction doses until blood glucose levels reach approximately 300 mg/dL and prescribing target A1cs of roughly 8.5%-9% versus a typical A1c of 4.6% in non-diabetic children (Daneman et al. Monitoring and the Target Range). According to the authors, microvascular complications associated with diabetic hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) is delayed in young children, and The clock does not start ticking (or at least starts clicking more slowly) in children with diabetes before the onset of puberty. It goes on to stress the long-term danger of hypoglycemic episodes (low blood sugar), which can lead to cognitive impairment down the road.What this means is that when caretakers find themselves in the position where they have to estimate carbohydrate intake (rather than knowing the exact amount such as when an exact serving size is eaten) it is always better to round the numbers down slightly rather than up. The reason this is significant to breastfeeding mothers is because when we look back at the approximate calculated carbohydrate content of breastmilk per ounce of milk, the difference in the amount of carbohydrates a nursling receives between average feedings of 4 to 6 ounces is roughly 4.5 carbs  statistically insignificant when calculating insulin dosing. In other words, guiding a nursing mother to round down her estimation of volume in a single nursing session (for example from 6 ounces to 4) when she is uncertain of intake, will result in her being off by approximately 4.5 grams in her estimated carb count. Compare this to the difficulty in assessing the exact carbohydrate intake of a toddler who is self feeding and losing large portions of their food to their diaper, floor, or otherwise, and this point becomes even more clear.Image courtesy of Jill Brown / flickr.comTo further illustrate the absurdity of worrying about the exact monitoring of breastmilk intake down to the ounce, Ill point out that finding the correct basal and correction doses to keep children in their target range is a trial and error process that requires ongoing adjustment as the child grows, activity levels change, and dietary needs and interests change. As any parent of a toddler knows, these variables can change from day to day, and even hour to hour. To suggest that a child receiving any, or all, of its caloric intake from breastmilk is any harder to predict (in regard to what solids he/she might eat over the course of a day) is preposterous. It is for this exact reason that doctors and diabetic educators council parents to administer insulin after a young child has eaten. Although it can take insulin approximately twenty minutes to begin working in the body, and best practice for older patients advises administering insulin roughly one half-hour prior topre-carb counted meals (Neithercott) to avoid blood sugar spikes, this practice, in the care of infants and toddlers is very risky. If the child is given a dose of insulin based on what they are expected to eat, and then eats less or even none of their meal (it does happen!) their blood sugar will quickly crash, causing a dangerous hypoglycemic episode. Following this logic, it is just as easy to estimate and cover the carbohydrate intake of a toddler who has just breastfed directly at the breast as one who has just finished a meal (based on what is found on and around the child, versus what is missing from the plate).If we can now safely assume that breastmilk is just as easily accounted for when counting carbohydrates as other foods and beverages, we can move our focus to the benefits of breastfeeding as they specifically relate to diabetes management in the young child. Every parent managing the care of a diabetic infant or toddler can attest to the fact that there are always certain foods that seem impossible to cover properly, or that just set their child off. Nutritionally speaking, foods that have a healthy balance of protein, fats, and carbohydrates, along with a healthy dose of fiber, are better than foods that are primarily carbohydrate based. This is because protein, fat, and fiber help slow the digestion of carbs, and help prevent spikes in blood sugar. This is true for all individuals not just diabetics. Unfortunately, this healthy practice can make it tricky to cover carbohydrate intake with the proper dosage and scheduling of insulin. In a non-diabetic person, the body will slowly release insulin over a period of time to match the carbs as they are released into the bloodstream. If a diabetic individual takes the correct dose of insulin (as calculated by a prescribed ratio) upfront, they run the risk of crashing because the full amount of insulin will be processed by the body faster than the carbohydrates they have just eaten. They then find themselves having to eat simple carbohydrate foods (fruits, juices, starches, etc.) to avoid a dangerously low glucose episode. Unfortunately at this point the carbs from the original meal are still in the body, waiting to be released. As those carbs enter the bloodstream, along with the catch up carbs, blood sugar starts to rise quickly and the person starts to battle hyperglycemia. This roller coaster ride is a familiar one to families managing T1 diabetes, and over time, and with practice, they get better at finding techniques (such as extended blousing or temporary adjustments to the basal dosage if using a pump) that help mimic the way the body naturally releases insulin, to minimize the number of times spent on the glucose see-saw. So how does this relate to the benefits of breastfeeding?Children who are exclusively breastfed tend to eat a relatively consistent amount of breastmilk on a day-to-day basis, which means that the overall intake of carbs is relatively consistent from day-to-day and can therefore be somewhat easily managed with a long- lasting insulin dose (or basal dose if on the pump). Because the child is receiving his or her nutrition from a relatively consistent food source, the stress of managing trigger foods and variations in diet is minimized. Incidences of high blood sugar that result from other factors can then be managed with a short-acting insulin such as Humalog or Novalog just as they would with a child on an exclusively solid or formula-based diet. Children who are receiving a portion of their calories from solid foods generally fall into one of two sub-categories. Those that nurse in small amounts (mostly for comfort) throughout the day, and those who take in larger amounts less frequently, such as at nap or bedtime. For the nurslings who take in relatively small amounts of breastmilk regularly throughout the day, their carb intake from each nursing session is usually small (less than 10 grams) and can often be accommodated by the long-lasting insulin dose (or basal if on a pump) just as if they were exclusively nursing. For those that nurse less frequently, but take in a larger volume of milk at each feeding, the carbohydrates in each nursing session usually average around 15 grams (for intake of approximately 5-8 ounces of milk), which can be accounted for much the same way one accounts for a small snack in a child that receives their nutrition from a non-breastfeeding diet. While figuring out the best balance of long- lasting/basal insulin and short acting insulin for carb covering and sugar correction doses will have to be a trial an error process, this is the case for all newly diagnosed individuals and shouldnt be used as a reason to restrict breastfeeding.Some other benefits that apply specifically to diabetic nurslings involve stress management for mother and child and simplicity of feeding (at a time when overall care is becoming increasingly more complex). When I close my eyes, I can still vividly see the image of my 15 month old strapped to a bed, with wires stemming from all parts of his body, desperately crying for the only comfort he knew  the comfort of his mothers breasts. While I could understand the need for immediate restriction of food by mouth while his high blood sugar and associated dka (diabetic ketoacidocis) status were addressed (he entered the hospital with blood glucose levels over 800!), I could not understand the warning from multiple PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) nurses that I would most likely have to fully and promptly wean him from the breast. I also could not accept the dismissiveness of the comments suggesting that weaning him at this stage, really shouldnt be a big deal since he was over the age of one year. In speaking to many moms around the country, Ive found that this is unfortunately the message that many moms are receiving at the time of their childs diagnosis. In addition to the immunological and nutritional benefits of mothers milk, it is becoming increasingly recognized that nursing provides so much more than just nutrition. According to Dr. Sears, Breastfeeding relaxes mother and baby [human] milk contains a natural sleep-inducing protein, that puts baby into a restful slumber. The hormones induced by sucking tranquilize mother. This natural calming is especially helpful for the baby (and mother) who has difficulty getting to sleep (Sears and Sears 124). I cant imagine a more stressful, sleepless time than when a child is diagnosed with a chronic, life-threatening disease. To strip mother and child of this valuable stress-management tool at a time of such high stress seems nothing more than cruel and unusual punishment! In addition to the hormonal influences, breastfeeding can help reduce stress by simplifying an otherwise chaotic new way of life. Managing high and low blood sugars is hard work and requires an on-call mindset twenty-four hours a day. Ask any parent of a young diabetic child which aspects of the disease they find most challenging, and they will likely mention the managing of middle of the night low blood sugars towards the top of their lists. While older children and adults can often be coaxed out of sleep to take a small snack or drink when their blood sugar dips, it is very difficult to convince an infant or toddler that they should wake in the middle of the night to eat or drink juice when they are in a sound sleep and not hungry. Because breastfed babies can, and often do, nurse without fully waking, it can be much easier to ward off a low blood sugar in the middle of the night by nursing (remember, a single larger nursing session can yield about 15 grams of carbs which is the equivalent of a prescribed snack for low blood sugar) than trying to force-feed a snack with 15 grams of carbs. Babies who are still taking in smaller amounts of milk more frequently can often be managed by small frequent feeds throughout the night in conjunction with an adjusted long-lasting dose or decreased basal dose (if on the pump) for nighttime hours. For instances of extreme low blood sugar, where breastmilk proves insufficient for adequately raising blood sugar, a little bit of honey (for babies over one year) or glucose gel (for younger infants) can often go a long way when rubbed along the inner gum and followed up with a nursing session.In addition to the on-going stress and complexity of daily diabetes management, are the acute stressors associated with events such as insulin injections, pump and/or continuous glucose monitor (cgm) site changes. While these activities dont take very long, they can often prove very stressful to the young child (and thus the caregiver). When the mother can put the baby to the breast for comfort while performing these activities, it often makes the overall experience much less stressful for everyone all around. Obviously at some point, the nursling will go through the weaning process and learn to endure injections and/or site changes without this comfort, but again, it seems cruel to strip mother and baby of this valuable tool in the early months following diagnosis when they need as many support structures in place as they can get!Obviously everybody is different, and individual needs must be assessed on a case-by- case basis, but I sincerely hope that this article will encourage more endocrinology teams to strongly weigh the significant benefits of breastfeeding against the minimal inconveniences associated with adjusting a care plan to accommodate breastfeeding before rashly advising mothers of newly diagnosed nurslings to wean.Works CitedAAP Reaffirms Breastfeeding Guidelines.

What does a breastfeeding mother look like?,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/picture-of-success/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCWhen you hear breastfeeding mother, what picture forms in your head? Do you imagine someone who follows World Health Organization recommendations and exclusively breastfeeds for 6 months, gradually begins solid foods, and continues breastfeeding for at least two years? Do you imagine someone who never needs to supplement her own milk and always feeds baby at the breast when they are together? Are these things necessary to be a breastfeeding mother?The answer to that question is NO  you can create a breastfeeding relationship in a wide range of circumstances. Many find that their actual breastfeeding situation is not what they originally expected or planned for. Breastfeeding challenges can originate from incorrect advice, separation of mother and baby, health issues, prematurity, anatomical issues (cleft, tongue-tie, insufficient glandular tissue, breast surgery), adoption, and so on. But even if your breastfeeding journey takes an unexpected detour, you are still a breastfeeding mother. Even if you are unable to produce all the milk your baby needs, you can still be a breastfeeding mother. Even if your baby is unable to latch, you can still be a breastfeeding mother. Every drop of breastmilk that your child gets is beneficial. Every moment at the breast that your child gets is beneficial. Breastfeeding is not all-or-nothing. Everyone has a different breastfeeding journey. Even if your breastfeeding reality is different than that of another person or what you had envisioned for yourself, you can create your own individual picture of breastfeeding success.Here are some examples of what a breastfeeding mother looks likePhoto used with permissionNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I fed my baby breast milk via a combination of feeding tube and bottles/sippy cups. She was born with Pierre Robin Sequence, which caused her major trouble with eating and breathing and she needed a feeding tube and trach. I pumped for her for 18 months through several surgeries and hospitalizations. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-Janice KurusI fed my babies at the breast with my milk and donor milk, with the help of domperidone and a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS). I have insufficient glandular tissue (IGT), likely due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism during puberty. My children nursed full term, until 4.5 and 5.5 years old. I became a LLL Leader and then an IBCLC because I wanted to help other mothers overcome their challenges. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-Kristin CavutoOral care with breastmilk while intubated. Photo credit: J.S.I fed my baby my hard earned pumped breastmilk, donor milk, and formula with a bottle and an SNS for her first six weeks. She was very sick and preterm, and I nursed a pump from her birth, every two to three hours around the clock, while nursing my baby with a bottle and an SNS. I fed, loved, and cared for my baby. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-J.S.Photo used with permissionI feed my baby donor milk using a Lact-Aid. I have IGT and dont produce enough milk to exclusively feed my baby, but I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-RachaelI feed my baby my breast milk and donor milk or formula using a homemade SNS. I have insufficient glandular tissue. My first son nursed for two years, and my second son is still happily nursing at 8 months old. This is not the breastfeeding journey that I had envisioned, however, I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-RowenaI fed my baby breast milk from the breast, but it took a while to get going as I have inverted nipples. We always tried the breast first, but if he couldnt latch, I pumped and we fed with a bottle. A nipple shield helped as did the Medela nipple everters. By 5 weeks he had broken down my adhesions and we both had a much better time of it. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-Kaitlin Y. (P.S. Now Im nursing my 2nd and hes having it easy!)Photo credit: Kaitlin Y.I fed my baby breastmilk exclusively for 10 months while working full time, pumping at work and nursing at night. Then, I grew tired, weary and stressed with pumping so I decided to combo feed, using formula while shes at daycare and nursing when were together, for a couple months until she turned 1. Now she is on organic whole milk and solids foods and we still occasionally nurse once a day at bedtime. I AM a successful breastfeeding mother.-Myra S.Photo credit: Nyssa RetterI have fed my baby formula and donor milk and now organic cows milk to supplement my low milk supply, using an SNS. My low milk supply is due to insufficient glandular tissue (IGT), but my baby is ALL about the boob and didnt want anything to do with supplemental bottles. Weve been using the Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) for over a year, and will continue to do so until my daughter decides to wean herself. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-Nyssa RetterPhoto credit: Nyssa RetterI was prepared to face low milk supply when my fourth child was born. I had a freezer full of donated colostrum and breast milk, and a collection of syringes, medicine droppers, and supplemental nursing systems. I was not prepared for a baby with multiple food intolerances, a lack of dairy and gluten free donor milk and a baby who refused to drink hypoallergenic formula. We soldiered on with donor milk, surviving reflux despite my own elimination diet. At 6 months, we began baby-led weaning, and at 8 months, we were able to discontinue donor milk and the SNS altogether with the help of nutritious food and coconut milk smoothies. At 10 months, we are still going strong and my baby is happier and healthier than ever! I am a successful breastfeeding mother!-Nyssa RetterPhoto credit: Tiffany Caruso PhotographyI feed my baby breastmilk by bottle and exclusive pumping. We used to feed with a nipple shield at the breast, but my little one was too inefficient due to a tongue tie. He is on his second revision now and I am hoping to go back to the breast someday with bottles while I am away at work. Regardless, the important thing to me, is that he is nourished by my milk. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-Krista WThough my oldest child nursed until 11 months; he was only exclusively breastfed for 6 weeks and was supplemented with formula the rest of the time. I have IGT (insufficient glandular tissue). For three months he took most of his nutrition through formula delivered via a Lact-Aid nurser. After 3 months of pumping, Domperidone, and other galactagogues such as brewers yeast, I achieved almost a full supply and nursed him exclusively for 6 weeks. After that we moved on to a combination of nursing and formula given through bottles. He abruptly weaned at 11 months after I had stopped taking Domperidone. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.My twins were born 22 months after my oldest. I hoped I would have more milk, but knew that with IGT I would not have enough milk for two children. I took Domperidone again and tandem nursed them for one year. They got half their nutritional needs from my breastmilk. The other half came through formula delivered via Lact-Aid nursers and the occasional bottle. After one year, I stopped supplementing with any formula but continued to comfort nurse them (still tandem nursing) until they were 19 months. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.When my last child was born, I began taking Domperidone right away and also began supplementing with donor milk (from a loving sister-in-law) fed through Lact-Aids. We soon discovered that in addition to my IGT, we were dealing with another huge breastfeeding obstacle; she was diagnosed with tongue and lip ties at two weeks. The ties were revised at four weeks, and her milk transfer actually worsened as her tongue built up scar tissue. I pumped and pumped and fed my milk, donor milk, and some formula through the Lact-Aid. At one point I exclusively pumped and only gave her bottles for four days. Her tongue was revised again at six weeks. By eight weeks we put away the Lact-Aid nursers. Today she nurses round the clock and receives a bottle or two a day; often the bottles contain my pumped milk, but sometimes they contain formula. I plan to nurse until she is at least 18 months. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.Not a single one of my breastfeeding experiences has been easy, and each of my nursing relationships has looked different. None of them were what I imagined before I had kids, but each has been infinitely rewarding. I am a successful breastfeeding mother, and I am proud of that!-MarshellePhoto credit: Nicole HarriganI fed my baby breastmilk via an NG tube and with a Lact-aid for the first four months of his life. Nicholas was born with Down syndrome and spent his first five weeks in the nicu. I was told that these kids dont nurse, (the implication being that I shouldnt bother trying). Id successfully nursed my older two children, so I knew that I had to try. He was very small and extremely sleepy in the beginning, so I pumped and he was fed via an NG tube. We started practicing latching with a nipple shield when he was a few days old, but he couldnt stay awake for more than a minute or two at a time.We brought him home with the NG tube still in place, but he was also taking the occasional bottle, and we continued practicing latching with the shield. I purchased a Lact-aid when Nicholas was about 3 months old, and it took us a few days to get the hang of it, but we muddled through and made it work. Once we got the hang of it, things really took off, and after a few weeks, we were able to ditch the shield and then the Lact-aid. Nicholas is now 17 months old, and still nursing like a champ. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.-Nicole HarriganPhoto credit: Stephanie ScottI feed my baby breast milk, donor milk and formula from a bottle in addition to bare breast. Previously I have also used the Medela SNS and Lact-Aid. I have suspected IGT and definite insulin resistance (IR) that, combined with high palate, made breastfeeding a challenge for all 3 of my babies. But we did it, each one longer than the last and still going strong with my youngest. I am a successful breastfeeding mother!-Stephanie ScottPhoto credit: Lise SmithI fed my daughter expressed milk via a bottle and an SNS. I did so while we worked through a tongue tie, lip tie, a poor latch, and extreme weight loss. We fought through it to nurse for years. I am a successful breastfeeding mother. Lise SmithI fed my baby breastmilk, donor milk and formula using my breasts and bottles. Despite a year of extensive work with an IBCLC and a doctor specializing in lactation, I was never able to produce enough milk to meet my little boys needs. I am a successful breastfeeding mother. -G.C.Photo credit: Brittnae HoytI am a successful breastfeeding mother even though I am unable to make milk. After 6 excruciating weeks of trying every herb, tea, food, prescription medication, lactation consultant, and pumping technique, I surrendered to the fact that my IGT will make it impossible to feed my son my milk. After countless tears and feeling like a failure, we decided to feed through an SNS to keep as much of a bond as possible. It is awkward and clumsy, and we are still working on it, but it is worth it to preserve any aspect of a breastfeeding relationship with my precious son. We are looking for milk donors, and are currently formula feeding. He is happy and thriving and even though it hurts my mama heart to feed him formula instead of my milk, I am learning to be gentle with myself.-Brittnae HoytPhoto used with permission.I feed my baby a combination of my milk & donor milk using an SNS. After my breast surgery my husband and I realized we wanted one more baby. When we found out we were expecting we were very excited. I couldnt help but worry about whether or not I would be able to breastfeed.During my pregnancy I met a mother who had a freezer overflowing with milk. I asked her if she would be willing to donate the milk to me in case my baby needed it. She was more than happy to help. She donated 50-100oz a week until baby was born.When baby was born I immediately latched him to my nipple. He latched really well! Unfortunately, no milk came out. After 24 hours of no wet diapers or sign of milk when pumping; I decided to introduce his donor milk using an SNS. 5 days later my milk started to come in. I was able to pump out 10ml.Not all my milk ducts were functioning well enough. Some, produced milk but the milk had no pathway to get to the nipple. I quickly developed mastitis in both breasts. I was told by the doctor that I needed to stop breast feeding and that I would get back-to-back mastitis if I continued to nurse my baby. I was told I had to stop stimulating the milk ducts to produce milk so they wouldnt make any milk that couldnt get out. I was devastated. I reached out to an IBCLC. She encouraged me to continue nursing baby. She told me the body had a way of knowing what it needs and the breasts will find a way to work. I held onto that little bit of hope and continued to nurse baby.Four weeks later, the damaged milk ducts dried up and stopped producing milk. My working milk ducts now produce up to 8oz of breast milk a day. That is a success. I am a successful breast feeding mother.-Michelle DahlmannPhoto credit: Stephanie EI feed my baby breastmilk and formula using my breasts and bottles. I have a combination of IGT and insulin resistance. I have worked incredibly hard for my son to have 10-12 ounces of my milk each day. I am a successful breastfeeding mother.Stephanie ENursing on the road, under an apple tree. Photo credit: Sean SmithI fed both of my babies a combination of breastmilk and formula. Both girls were born after long labors via c-section and lost more than 10% of their birth weight; I got lots of pressure to supplement, a lot of conflicting advice from LCs and even IBCLCs, and was generally overwhelmed and unprepared for a fight, especially with my first daughter. Even with my second daughter, armed with much more support and knowledge, I succumbed to so many booby traps and got so overwhelmed with all that happened in the hospital. My first daughter only received breastmilk for 12 weeks (the little I was able to pumpshe was very adamantly reluctant to breastfeed and we both found the SNS too fiddly and frustrating). As an infant, my second daughter spent lots of time at the breast and nursing was supplemented with bottles of formula and my breastmilk (due to low weight gain and outputsupplement was carefully calculated by me to not interfere with my already low supply). Once she turned one, we weaned her from formula and the bottle (and me from the pump); she continued nursing and is still nursing these days at three and a half.

What do health authorities say about breastfeeding past the first year?,http://kellymom.com/ages/after12mo/aap-breastfeeding-past-the-first-year/,"Julia Shilova - Fotolia.comThe World Health Organization supports breastfeeding past the first year and beyondThe World Health Organizations Global strategy for infant and young child feeding says:As a global public health recommendation, infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Thereafter, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues for up to two years of age or beyond. From WHO Fact Sheet No. 342: Infant and young child feeding:Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months has many benefits for the infant and mother Breast milk is also an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged 6 to 23 months. It can provide half or more of a childs energy needs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months. Breast milk is also a critical source of energy and nutrients during illness, and reduces mortality among children who are malnourished. Adults who were breastfed as babies are less likely to be overweight/obese. Children and adolescents that have been breastfed perform better in intelligence tests. Breastfeeding also contributes to the health and well-being of mothers; it reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and helps space pregnancies Mothers and families need to be supported for their children to be optimally breastfed. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The American Academy of Pediatrics supports breastfeeding past the first year and beyondIn theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics 2005 Policy Statement:Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk, the AAP says:Increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and the mother, especially in delaying return of fertility (thereby promoting optimal intervals between births) There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer.TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics 2012 Policy Statement: Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milknotes:The AAP reaffirms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant.From theBreastfeeding Handbook for Physicians, 2nd ed.(AAP & ACOG, 2013) [Note: This is also AAP policy]:p. 20:The question of whether there is an upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding has been asked. Data on the scientific foundation for an age above which it is inappropriate or harmful to the child to continue breastfeeding do not exist. Nor are there reported risks to this method of social/nutritional interactions.p. 122 (Breastfeeding in the Second Year and Beyond):Breastfeeding should be continued, with appropriate complementary foods, for as long as the mother and infant mutually desire. In societies where children are allowed to nurse as long as they wish, they usually self-wean, without emotional trauma, between 3 and 4 years of age. Physicians may be surprised to discover that their patients are actually nursing much longer than they believe. Mothers may fail to disclose that they are continuing to nurse an older infant or child because they perceive that their physician may not approve of or support their continued breastfeeding.The studies demonstrating advantages of breastfeeding for infants and mothers suggest that many of the benefits are directly related to the duration of breastfeeding, The composition of human milk does not change markedly from 12 to 24 months, including most nutrients and bioactive factors. Because the human immune system may not mature completely for several years, the constituents of human milk continue to support the host defense of the infant. Breastfeeding promotes comfort and caring. A strong attachment to the mother during the early years may have a positive neurobehavioral effect. Long-term breastfeeding seems to be a mutually positive experience for mother and child.The American Academy of Family Physicians supports breastfeeding past the first year and beyondThe AAFPs Policy Statement on Breastfeeding says: As recommended by the WHO, breastfeeding should ideally continue beyond infancy, but this is not the cultural norm in the United States and requires ongoing support and encouragement. It has been estimated that a natural weaning age for humans is between two and seven years. Family physicians should be knowledgeable regarding the ongoing benefits to the child of extended breastfeeding, including continued immune protection, better social adjustment, and having a sustainable food source in times of emergency. The longer women breastfeed, the greater the decrease in their risk of breast cancer. Mothers who have immigrated from cultures in which breastfeeding beyond infancy is routine should be encouraged to continue this tradition. There is no evidence that extended breastfeeding is harmful to mother or child. Breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy is not unusual. If the pregnancy is normal and the mother is healthy, breastfeeding during pregnancy is the womans personal decision. If the child is younger than two years, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned. Breastfeeding the nursing child after delivery of the next child (tandem nursing) may help provide a smooth transition psychologically for the older child. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine supports breastfeeding past the first year and beyondThe ABMs Position on Breastfeeding says:Optimal infant and young child feeding is exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, and continued breastfeeding for at least 1 and up to 2 years or longer, with age-appropriate complementary feeding. From the ABM Press Release: ABM affirms breastfeeding beyond infancy as the biological norm:The average age at weaning ranges anywhere from six months to five years Claims that breastfeeding beyond infancy is harmful to mother or infant have absolutely no medical or scientific basis, says Arthur Eidelman, MD, president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine.  Indeed, the more salient issue is the damage caused by modern practices of premature weaning.  The global organization of physicians further notes that Human milk contains nutrients, antibodies, and immune-modulating substances that are not present in infant formula or cows milk. Longer breastfeeding duration is further associated with reduced maternal risks of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and heart attack.

Is baby ready for solid foods? (What do the experts say?),http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/delay-solids/,"Image courtesy of imagerymajestic / FreeDigitalPhotos.netHealth experts and breastfeeding experts agree that its best to wait until your baby is around six months old before offering any food other than breastmilk. There has been a large amount of research on this, and most health organizations have updated their recommendations to agree with current research. Unfortunately, many health care providers and written materials are not up to date in what they are advising parents.Following are just a few of the organizations that recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed (no cereal, juice or any other foods) for the first 6 months of life (not the first 4-6 months):World Health OrganizationUNICEFAmerican Academy of Pediatrics American Academy of Family Physicians Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Health CanadaMost babies will become developmentally and physiologically ready to eat solid foods between 6 and 8 months of age.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Why wait until 6 months for solids?Although many of the reasons listed here assume that your baby is breastfed or fed breastmilk only, experts generally recommend that solids be delayed for formula fed babies also.Baby will have greater protection from illness. Although children continue to receive many immunities from breastmilk for as long as they breastfeed, the greatest immunity occurs while a baby is exclusively breastfed. Breastmilk contains 50+ known immune factors, and also facilitates the development of good bacteria that protect babys gut. Studies have shown that many illnesses and conditions are less likely to occur when baby receives any amount of breastmilk. Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 3-4 months (compared to non-exclusive breastfeeding) further decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), allergic disease, celiac disease, and type 1 diabetes.Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months (compared to 4-6 months), further decreases the risk of gastrointestinal infection and respiratory infection. (AAP 2012,Naylor & Morrow 2001)Babys digestive system will have time to mature.If solids are started before a babys system is ready to handle them, they are poorly digested and may cause unpleasant reactions (digestive upset, gas, constipation, etc.). Digestion of fats, protein, and complex carbohydratesis incomplete in infancy, but human milk contains enzymes that aid efficient digestion(Naylor & Morrow 2001).In addition, from birth until somewhere between four and six months of age babies possess what is often referred to as anopen gut. This means that the spaces between the cells of the small intestines will readily allow intact macromolecules, including whole proteins and pathogens, to pass directly into the bloodstream. This is great for your breastfed baby as it allows beneficial antibodies in breastmilk to pass more directly into babys bloodstream, but it also means that large proteins fromotherfoods (which may predispose baby to allergies) and disease-causing pathogens can pass right through, too. During babys first 4-6 months, while the gut is still open, antibodies (sIgA) from breastmilk coat babys digestive tract and providepassiveimmunity, reducing the likelihood of illness and allergic reactions before gut closure occurs. Baby starts producing these antibodies on his own at around 6 months, and gut closure should have occurred by this time also. For more on this subject, see:Just One Bottle Wont Hurtor Will It?,How Breast Milk Protects Newborns,andThe Virgin Gut: A Note for Parents.Baby will be developmentally ready to eat foods that are not liquids.A review done by Naylor & Morrow (2001)concluded, These clinicalreports indicate that the majority of normal full term infants are not developmentally ready forthe transition from suckling to sucking or for managing semi-solids and solid foods in addition toliquids until between six and eight months of age.Baby will have a lower risk of obesity in the future.The early introduction of solids in infancy is associated with increased body fat and weight in adolescents and adults. (AAP 2012,Wilson 1998, von Kries 1999, Kalies 2005)Starting solids will be easier.Babies who start solids later can feed themselves.Baby may have more protection from iron-deficiency anemia.The introduction of iron supplements and iron-fortified foods, particularly during the first six months, reduces the efficiency of babys iron absorption. In one study of healthy, full-term infants (Pisacane, 1995), the researchers concluded that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 7 months (and were not give iron supplements or iron-fortified cereals) had significantly higher hemoglobin levels at one year than breastfed babies who received solid foods earlier than seven months. The researchers found no cases of anemia within the first year in babies breastfed exclusively for seven months and concluded that breastfeeding exclusively for seven months reduces the risk of anemia. See Is Iron-Supplementation Necessary? for more information.Mom will more easily maintain her milk supply.Studies have shown that for babies under six months, solids tend to replace breastmilk in a babys diet  they do not add to babys total intake (WHO 2003, Cohen 1994, Dewey 1999). The more solids that baby eats, the less milk he takes from mom, and less milk taken from mom means less milk production. Babies who eat lots of solids or who start solids early tend to wean prematurely.Mom is less likely to become pregnant.Breastfeeding is most effective in preventing pregnancy when your baby is exclusively breastfed and all of his nutritional and sucking needs are satisfied at the breast (Dont believe this? Its strongly supported by research  see Breastfeeding and Fertility for more information). Mothers who exclusively breastfeed for 6 months vs 4 months have a longer duration of lactational amenorrhea (thenatural postpartum infertility that occurs when a woman is not menstruating due to breastfeeding). (Kramer & Kakuma, 2012)Mom can more quickly lose extra baby weight.Mothers who exclusively breastfeed their babies for 6 months (compared to 4 months) have more rapid postpartum weight loss (Kramer & Kakuma, 2012).Have you heard that foods should be introduced into the infant diet between 4 and 6 months to reduce the risk of developing allergy, celiac disease or type 1 diabetes mellitus?The current evidence has been reviewed by several authorities, and the conclusion was that there is insufficient evidence to support the introduction of gluten (or other solid foods) into the infant diet before 6 months.Kramer MS, Kakuma R. Optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2012, Issue 8. Art. No.: CD003517. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003517.pub2.Although infants should still be managed individually so that insufficient growth or other adverse outcomes are not ignored and appropriate interventions are provided, the available evidence demonstrates no apparent risks in recommending, as a general policy, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life in both developing and developed-country settings.American Academy of Pediatrics, Section on Breastfeeding.Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk.Pediatrics. 2012;129(3):e827-41.Overall, there is an association between increased duration of breastfeeding and reduced risk of celiac disease when measured as the presence of celiac antibodies. The critical protective factor appears to be not the timing of the gluten exposure but the overlap of breastfeeding at the time of the initial gluten ingestion. Thus, gluten-containing foods should be introduced while the infant is receiving only breast milk and not infant formula or other bovine milk products.SACN/COT statement on the timing of the introduction of gluten into the infant diet  March 2011.SACN (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition) and COT (Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment) in the UK concluded: Overall currently available evidence on the timing of introduction of gluten into the infant diet and subsequent risk of coeliac disease and T1DM (type 1 diabetes mellitus) is insufficient to support recommendations about the appropriate timing of introduction of gluten into the infant diet beyond 3 completed months of age, for either the general population or high-risk sub-populations.WHO Statement: Exclusive breastfeeding for six months best for babies everywhere (15 January 2011)UNICEF UK response to media reports questioning the recommendation to introduce solid food to babies at 6 months (2011)Ensuring that the mother is not anaemic and that cord cutting is delayed will in turn ensure that the babys own body stores and breastmilk will provide sufficient iron for over 6 months. The majority of the food commonly introduced to babies in the early months such as cereal, fruit and vegetables are low in iron and will therefore not help prevent IDA. However, if they are introduced before a baby needs them, they will displace breastmilk from the babys diet and may thereby reduce the amount of iron consumed.The incidence of genuine food allergy (as opposed to food intolerance) is rare. There is speculation and some observational data that when there is a family history of true allergy then early introduction of certain foods may be beneficial. Random control trials are now being undertaken to test this theory. Should this prove to be the case (which is by no means certain) then high risk families would need to be advised on a case-by-case basis. This would not affect public policy as applied to the majority of children not affected by allergies.Is babys risk for type I diabetes increased if solids are introduced before 3 months or after 6 months?at KellyMomAdditional information & referencesSolid Foods and the Breastfed Baby at KellyMomIs Iron-Supplementation Necessary? at KellyMomHow can I tell if my baby is ready for solid foods? at KellyMomWill giving formula or solids at night help baby to sleep better?

The initial colonizing bacteria vary with the food source of the infant. In breast-fed infants bifidobacteria account for more than 90% of the total intestinal bacteria. Enterobacteriaceae and enterococci are regularly present, but in low proportions, while bacteroides, staphylococci, lactobacilli and clostridia are practically absent. In bottle-fed infants, bifidobacteria are not predominant. When breast-fed infants are switched to a diet of cows milk or solid food, bifidobacteria are progressively joined by enterics, bacteroides, enterococci lactobacilli and clostridia. Apparently, human milk contains a growth factor that enriches for growth of bifidobacteria, and these bacteria play an important role in preventing colonization of the infant intestinal tract by non indigenous or pathogenic species.Breast-Milk: The White Blood by Arlene JacobsWHO Resources on Child NutritionKramer MS, Kakuma R.

No deficits have been demonstrated in growth among infants from either developing or developed countries who are exclusively breastfed for 6 months or longer. Moreover, the mothers of such infants have more prolonged lactational amenorrhea and faster postpartum weight loss.

Early introduction of complementary foods did not provide any advantages in terms of weight gain in our environment, it was frequently associated with illness episodes and growth faltering.

How do I determine if a medication is safe for a breastfeeding mother?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/med-risks/,"Have you ever been told you need to stop breastfeeding because you need medical testing or a medication? Or told that you cannot receive treatment until you are done breastfeeding? The good news is thatmost medications are compatible with breastfeeding, and for those few medications that are a safety issue there are usually acceptable substitutions.Although mothers are frequently told they need to stop breastfeeding (temporarily or permanently)to take a medication, this is rarely necessary.According to Thomas Hale, RPh,PhD (Medications and Mothers Milk 2014, p. 7-12): It is generally accepted that all medications transfer into human milk to some degree, although it is almost always quite low. Only rarely does the amount transferred into milk produce clinically relevant doses in the infant Most importantly, it is seldom required that a breastfeeding mother discontinue breastfeeding just to take a medication. It is simply not acceptable for the clinician to stop lactation merely because of heightened anxiety or ignorance on their part. The risks of formula feeding are significant and should not be trivialized. Few drugs have documented side effects in breastfed infants, and we know most of these.These references areGOOD sources forinformation on medications and breastfeeding:Medications and Mothers Milkby Thomas Hale, RPh, PhD, is our favorite reference book and is updated every two years. This inexpensive reference is a must-have for anyone working with breastfeeding mothers, or breastfeeding mothers who frequently need information on medications.The InfantRisk Center(1-806-352-2519), headed by Dr. Thomas Hale in the US, has a phone helpline and additional information on medication use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.TheLactMed Database, afree online database maintained by the National Library of Medicine in the US, is a wonderfulonlineresourcefor information on breastfeeding and medications.If your health care provider does not know about this resource, spread the word!They also have afree smartphone appthat is very useful.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Drugs in Breastmilk (0844 412 4665), from The Breastfeeding Network in the UK, has a phone helpline and additional information on medication in breastfeeding mothers.Talking to babys health care provider (in addition to your own doctor) is also a good idea. Babys doctor will generally know more about the effects of medications on infants and young children, and whether a medication is typically given directly to infants or young children. Your babys doctor will also be aware of any particular health concerns that your baby has with respect to a particular medication.These references are NOT good sources for information on medications and breastfeeding:It is not appropriate to use pregnancy risk categories (A,B,C,D,X) to determine the risk of a drug to a breastfeeding mother and her baby, since the entry of drugs into human milk is quite different than the entry of drugs across the placenta during pregnancy.It is not uncommon to see doctors using the Physicians Desk Reference for information on medications and nursing. This reference contains the package inserts from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Almost across the board, they indicate that each medication should not be taken while pregnant or breastfeeding. The warning statements they use are designed to protect themselves from lawsuits. The information in the PDR is based on the manufacturers studies on the product, but not other studies that have been done. In general the manufacturers have done no studies on lactating women, and thus say that there is no information (even if studies have been done by others). Many doctors also have access to the USPDI (US Pharmacoepia Drug Information), which tends to have more accurate information than the PDR about studies done on the drug and available information about transfer into milk. If you dont have access to the gold standard references (above) on medications and breastfeeding, this reference is generally a better choice than the PDR.If someone suggests that you should stop breastfeeding while taking a certain medication, keep in mind that this is a cost-benefit decision the information available on the medication is not the only thing you need to take into account.When considering a medication (including herbal and other natural preparations) here are several factors to take into account:Does the mother need this medication/treatment right now, or is it something that she does not need or can easily postpone until her child is older?How old is the breastfeeding child? Is s/he healthy? Premature babies, newborns, and babies with health problems require somewhat more caution when it comes to the medications that the mother is taking; healthy older babies and toddlers are generally at a lesser risk since their bodies can metabolize medications more easily.How much breastmilk does the child get? A child who is getting smaller amounts of breastmilk (a newborn in the early days before mothers milk volume naturally increases, a baby or child who is eating other foods in addition to breastmilk and breastfeeds less often, etc.) will also be getting less of any medication that passes into breastmilk.Is the medication in question one with a record of safely being given directly to babies and young children? The amount of the medication that passes into breastmilk will normally be significantly lower than that given directly to young children.Avoid medications known to affect milk production.Temporary weaning is a risk to the mothersmilk supply. Milk supply may be compromised since pumps do not provide the same stimulation to supply as does a nursing baby. For the rare times when temporary weaning is needed, see this information onmaintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing.Temporary weaning comes with a risk that baby will not goback to the breast. Some babies have a hard time returning to breastfeeding after temporary weaning, and unfortunately we do not know ahead of time which babies will have problems.There areknown risks of formula feeding, including allergy, increased illness, etc. Many of the risks of formula feeding are not apparent for many years.If youre having problems finding the information you need, contact a local lactation consultant, or breastfeeding counselor.Looking for good medication resources in languages other than English?e-lactancia,afree online databasemaintained byAPILAM(Association for Promotion and Cultural and Scientific Research of Breastfeeding) inValencia, Spain, is another wonderful onlineresourcewith information on breastfeeding and medications, phytotherapy (plants), homeopathy and other alternative products, cosmetic and medical procedures, contaminants, and maternal/infant diseases.

Why Keep Infant Formula Marketing Out of Healthcare Facilities?,http://kellymom.com/blog-post/why-keep-infant-formula-marketing-out-of-healthcare-facilities/,"There are a number of common objections I hear from parents about the campaign to keep infant formula marketing out of health care facilities.Is this campaign is intended to make parents who use formula feel guilty?No!This message is directed at the infant formula manufacturers and the thousands of health care facilities that give these manufacturers free access to mothers:It is not directed at parents.It does not advocate against parents choosing to use formulaIt does not suggest that formula sales to the public should be limited.It does say that health care facilities and formula manufacturers should stopthese practices that prevent mothers from meeting their own breastfeeding goals.Health care providers need to stop broadcasting a mixed message Breast is best, but heres some formula because we dont expect it to work for you.Two-thirds of mothers who intend to exclusively breastfeed are not meeting their intended duration. Perrine et al, Baby-Friendly Hospital Practices and Meeting Exclusive Breastfeeding IntentionHealth care facilities should providecommercial-freeinformation and support to mothers who need or choose to use formula. Instead of advertising hype, parents who use formula deserve to have unbiased information from their health care providers.Formula is expensive, and one of the things driving this high cost is the huge amount of money spent on free samples/advertising in health care facilities and advertising to health care providers (including free products, meals, seminars, and more). From a quick online price check at a discount store (comparing only powdered formulas), the brand name formulas are 1.5 to 2 times the cost of a generic formula. Ready-to-feed formulations are even more expensive. The nutritional ingredients are the same.Formula manufacturers know that the brand of formula mothers are given in the hospital is the one they are most likely to continue to use through the first year or longer.Almost all mothers doing any amount of bottle-feeding at the time of their interview were using the same formula brand and a ready-to-feed preparation used during their hospital stay. Reiff & Essok-Vitale, Hospital Influences on Early Infant-Feeding PracticesParents who buy infant formula and stick with the brand the hospital distributed are paying tons of money for those free samples  $700+ per year over the cost of generic formula. The reason the formula companies include all these freebies in their advertising budgets is because it generates huge profits!You can buy a really fancy diaper bag for the amount of money it costs parents who are buying the formula, plus you wouldnt be advertising a formula company wherever you go.Removing formula gift bags from health care facilities will not take formula from the mouths of hungry babies. Formula will still be available in the hospital, and it is widely available in practically every grocery store, pharmacy, discount superstore, baby store, and more. In the US, there are also many resources (including WIC) for those parents who have problems affording formula.You may think that mothers would not be influenced by advertising, but randomized controlled trials tell us otherwise. Mothers who receive formula gift bags are more likely to supplement with formula and are more likely to discontinue breastfeeding earlier even when the formula is removed from the bag before the bag is given to mom. The formula manufacturers know how useful it is (to their profits) to ensure that formula goes home from the hospital with breastfeeding mothers. Many a brand-new breastfeeding mother has reached straight for the formula instead of reaching out for breastfeeding help when her newborn is fussy, and/or others around her are suggesting that her milk is just not adequate. And why not? After all, the doctor gave it to me, so it must be just as good or better than breastmilkHealth authorities in the US agree that infant formula marketing does not belong in health care facilities so why is it still there?Distribution of discharge packs contributes to premature breastfeeding discontinuation. The ACOG [American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists], AAP [American Academy of Pediatrics], American Public Health Association (APHA), and the federal Government Accountability Oce (GAO) all identify this practice as inappropriate in medical environments and recommend against it.  US Centers for Disease Control, Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care2011 mPINC Survey (State Reports)Be it resolved, that the Academy advise pediatricians not to provide formula company gift bags, coupons, and industry-authored handouts to the parents of newborns and infants in office and clinic settings. American Academy of Pediatrics, 2012 AAP Resolution  Divesting from Formula Marketing in Pediatric CareThe distribution of materials such as free samples, pamphlets, notepads, growth charts, or gifts that bear logos from companies marketing infant formula implicitly endorses formula feeding. Displays of posters, products, or decorations from these companies in a health care professionals office or in a hospital or clinic leave the impression that clinicians favor formula feeding over breastfeeding. Given the health consequences of not breastfeeding, clinicians should not implicitly promote infant formula by providing venues for its advertisement.

Infant Formula Corporations Have Violated World Health Organization Marketing Standards for 33 Years,http://kellymom.com/bf/advocacy/infant-formula-corporations-have-violated-world-health-organization-marketing-standards-for-33-years/,"Eva Seidelman, Public Citizen33 years ago today, the World Health Organization adopted theInternational Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes(AKA the WHO Code) to promote breastfeeding and limit formula companies influence over womens infant feeding decisions. Today, most health care facilities and the largest formula makers continue toviolate the Codein the U.S. and worldwide.To mark the anniversary of the WHO Code, more than 20 organizations and thousands of moms and citizens today are participating in a day of action led by Public Citizen, directed at the largest formula makers in the U.S. and Canada  Mead Johnson (of Enfamil), Abbott (Similac) and Nestle (Gerber Good Start). They are especially urging the companies to end the unethical practice ofpromoting formula in health care facilities, particularly through the distribution of commercial discharge bags with formula samples  a longstanding violation of the code.Mothers and leaders are delivering apetitionwith more than 17,000 signatures to Mead Johnson at its headquarters outside of Chicago. The petition will also be presented to Abbott and Nestle.Thousands of others are taking action remotely, sending photos and messages to companies on Facebook, Twitter and other online platforms. A diverse group of consumer rights, public health, womens health, corporate accountability and breastfeeding advocacy organizations are co-sponsoring the effort. The day of action is not meant to advocate against formula use if necessary but to focus on the need to give mothers information that hasnt been influenced by formula companies.Most health care professionals and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed for six months. A large body of research shows that antibodies passed from a nursing mother to her baby can help lower the occurrence of many conditions among infants including ear and respiratory infections, diarrhea, meningitis and higher risks of allergies, sudden infant death syndrome and other health risks. Mothers also benefit, with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, obesity, ovarian cancer, post-partum depression and bladder infections.Public health experts overwhelmingly discourage hospitals and doctors offices from distributing formula company-sponsored gift bags and formula samples  common marketing tactics  but formula companies still find ways to market formula in facilities nationwide. Studies show such formula sample distribution undermines womens breastfeeding success because the practice is viewed as an endorsement of formula by health care providers. In 2011, then-U.S. Surgeon General Regina A. Benjamin called formore enforcement of the WHO Codethrough theBaby Friendly Hospital Initiative,which requires designated hospitals to comply with the code.Nearly half of the worlds countries have adopted legislation to implement the Code, but in the U.S.  as a result of formula industry lobbying  legislation remains out of reach.But advocacy efforts have led many hospitals to end formula promotion over the past decade. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC)surveys, 27.4 percent of hospitals had discontinued the formula discharge bags for breastfeeding mothers in 2007, and by 2011, 45.5 percent had ended the practice. All hospitals in Massachusetts and Rhode Island have voluntarily banned discharge bags, and a recent Public Citizen and Ban the Bagsreportfound that 82 percent of the U.S. News and World Reports top-ranked hospitals, and more than two-thirds of the highest ranked hospitals in gynecology, no longer hand out commercial formula discharge bags with samples. However, formula companies have increasingly managed to push formula samples in doctors offices and clinics, often without the knowledge of health care providers within those offices.Diverse organizations are co-sponsoring the day of action with Public Citizen. They include the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee (composed of more than 50 member organizations), the Best for Babes Foundation, Food and Water Watch, Corporate Accountability International, the National Womens Health Network, Our Bodies Ourselves, La Leche League USA, HealthConnect One, the National Alliance for Breastfeeding Advocacy, the California WIC Association, Power U Center for Social Change, Breastfeed Chicago, the Massachusetts Breastfeeding Coalition, the North Carolina Breastfeeding Coalition, the Coalition of Oklahoma Breastfeeding Advocates, the Pennsylvania Breastfeeding Coalition, the New York State Breastfeeding Coalition, United States Lactation Consultants Association and Women Empowered Systems Enrichment (WISE).To read Public Citizens report and learn more about the organizations campaign to stop infant formula marketing in health care facilities, visithttp://citizen.org/infant-formula.###Public Citizen is a national, nonprofit consumer advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C.

When will my milk come in?,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/when-will-my-milk-come-in/,"Image credit: RaphaelGoetter on flickrMilk production begins around the midpoint of pregnancy. For most mothers, milk will come in (increase in quantity and begin the change from colostrum to mature milk) between days 2 and 5.Is there milk in my breasts at birth?Yes! Colostrum is being produced from about 16-22 weeks of pregnancy, although many mothers are not aware that the milk is there since it may not be leaking or easy to express. Colostrum is the early, concentrated milk that is full of nutrients and disease-fighting antibodies  it provides everything that your baby needs in the early days after birth. Your babys stomach is very small at birth, and the amounts of colostrum (transitioning gradually to mature breastmilk once your milk comes in) are perfect for babys needs. The average colostrum intake by healthy babies increases from 2-10 mL per feeding in the first 24 hours to 30-60 mL (1-2 oz) per feed by the end of day 3 (ABM 2009).Average Intake of Colostrum/MilkBabys AgePer FeedingPer 24 hoursDay 1 (0-24 hours)2-10 mL (< 2 tsp)30 mL (1 oz)Day 2 (24-48 hours)5-15 mL (1 tsp   oz)Day 3 (48-72 hours)15-30 mL ( 1 oz) by Day 730-60 mL (1-2 oz)300-600 mL (10-20 oz)Weeks 2 & 360-90 mL (2-3 oz)450-750 mL (15-25 oz)1-6 months90-120 mL (3-4 oz)750-1035 mL (25-35 oz)References: ABM 2009,Mannel et al 2013, Mohrbacher 2010.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.When can I expect my milk to increase?Milk production normally begins to increase (biochemically) between 30 and 40 hours after delivery of the placenta, but it may take a little while for the changes to become apparent to the mother. Milk coming in generally refers to the time when the mother notices increased breast fullness (and other signs) as milk production begins to kick into full gear this usually occurs 2-3 days after birth, but in as many as 25% of mothers this may take longer than 3 days.Signs that your milk is increasing may include:breast fullness, swelling, heaviness, warmth,engorgement, tinglingleaking milkchange in babys feeding patterns and behavior at the breastif youre expressing milk or leaking, you may notice the milk begin its gradual change in appearance from the thicker golden colostrum to the thinner, whiter mature milkKeep in mind that many women experience their milk coming in as a gradual change, rather than a sudden one.Research indicates that this timing is hormonally controlled  it does not require that baby be breastfeeding at all. However, mothers who breastfeed early and often(or express milk if breastfeeding is not going well) havehigher milk production on days 3-4, and their infants lose less weight and have lower bilirubin levels (less jaundice).Skin-to-skin contactwith baby has also been associated with increased milk production.Milk production will begin to shut down if milk is not being removed by the time your milk is coming in.Risk factors for delayed onset of lactationWhen a mothers milk does not undergo the expected increase in volume within 3 days of birth (72 hours postpartum)  this is called delayed onset of lactation (DOL).Studies have shown that risk factors for delayed onset of lactation include:First time mothers  tend to have milk come in about a day later than mothers with more than one child.Labor & Delivery factorsLarge amounts of IV fluid during laborPain medications during labor, regardless of delivery methodStressful, exhausting, or traumatic vaginal birthCesarean section (it is unclear whether this is due to the stress of surgery, medications, delaying breastfeeding, and/or less than optimal breastfeeding management)A long pushing stage during birth (over one hour)Blood loss (more than 500 mL/1 pint)Retained placenta or anything that affects placental function. If there is a retained placenta, the milk will typically come in normally once the placental fragments are removed.Maternal HealthIssues that affect moms hormones or her response to hormones, including insulin resistance, unstable or poorly controlledType-1 diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, hypothyroidismor pituitary issues including Sheehans Syndrome, hypertension, gestational ovarian theca lutein cysts.ObesityResearch suggests that instead of a true DOL, the increased risk may be due to a slower increase in production because of less than optimal breastfeeding management, a decreased prolactin response to breastfeeding, or increased body mass affecting breast development during puberty.In the following factors, the milk is most likely coming in on schedule, but milk production may not increase enough to be felt as increased fullnessMaternal breast issuesPreterm birth (may cut short the breast growth of late pregnancy, resulting in less milk producing tissue at birth, but good breastfeeding management will result in breast growth continuing after birth)Underdeveloped breasts Hypoplasia/Insufficient Glandular TissueBreast surgery or injury (may either remove/damage breast tissue or damage nerves that interfere with milk ejection)Unusual nipple anatomy, flat or inverted nipples, or nipple piercing have the potential to interfere with milk transferAny breastfeeding management issue, including maternal illness, that affects milk removal from the breast in the early daysAny medication that decreases milk production in the early days, including hormonal birth control.What do I do if my milk does not come in by day 4?Optimize breastfeeding management to make sure the breast is being emptied frequently and thoroughly; skin-to-skin contact with baby can also help with milk production.Monitor babys weight to make sure he/she is gettingenough milk if your baby loses more than 7% of birth weight, breastfeeding should be evaluated. If baby is not getting enough milk,supplementationmay be warranted.Schedule a visit with alocalboard-certified lactation consultant to make a plan to increase your milk production and monitor babys progress.Ifa cause can be determined for the delay, there may be further measures that you can take to remedy the situation (for example, if retained placental fragments are the issue,the milk usually comes in normally once the placental fragments are removed). Checking endocrine levels (thyroid,testosterone, prolactin)may be useful.If youre struggling after a difficult start: Remember that many mothers have been able to slowly bring in a full milk supply after a week or two (and sometimes even after many weeks!).References and more information:Breastfeeding your newborn  what to expect in the early weeks@KellyMom.comIncreasing Low Milk Supply@KellyMom.comHow Does Milk Production Work?@KellyMom.comABM [Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine] Clinical Protocol #3: Hospital guidelines for the use of supplementary feedings in the healthy term breastfed neonate, revised 2009.

Milk Bank FAQ,http://kellymom.com/ages/bf-preemie/milk-bank-faq/,"When we talk about human milk banks in North America, were generally referring to the non-profit HMBANA (Human Milk Banking Association of North America) milk banks. The milk from these banks is often the safest source of lifesaving donor milk for seriously ill babies and the only source of donor milk that many hospitals are willing to use.The information in this article does not apply to thefor-profit milk banks (e.g., Prolacta, Medolac/Mothers Milk Cooperative/Neolac) that have come into existence relatively recently, and use the donated milk to manufacture high-profit human milk-based nutritional products.Why do HMBANA Milk Banks charge a processing fee for milk?Image courtesy of the Mothers Milk Bank in DenverNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Many mothers wonder why the non-profit HMBANA human milk banks charge a fee for milk even though the milk has been donated by mothers.Even though the milk is donated, there are expenses that must be covered to screen donors, process the milk, distribute the milk and keep the milk banks open.Laraine Lockhart Borman, IBCLC, with the Mothers Milk Bank in Denver, CO explainsHuman Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) banks do not charge for the milk itself, only for the processing of the milk and related overhead. Processing includes:the multi step screening of the donor, including blood testsdonor trackingpasteurizationtesting and analysis of the milkRelated operational costs include:rental of office spacepurchase of bottles and capsfreezersemployee payroll (volunteers are utilized whenever possible)HMBANA Milk Banks are non-profit organizations making enough to keep doors open and continue to do the important work of helping to save babies lives. While the majority of the pasteurized human milk from the Mothers Milk Bank in Denver is sold to hospitals, milk depots also sell this life-saving nutrition to individuals.A baby with a health condition warranting the need for milk is never denied milk because of the inability to pay. Recipients always have the opportunity to apply for financial aid.Why do milk banks require that donors avoid regular use of most medications and herbal supplements?HMBANA donor guidelines require that donors are:not regularly on most medications or herbal supplements (with the exception of prenatal vitamins, human insulin, thyroid replacement hormones, nasal sprays, asthma inhalers, topical treatments, eye drops, progestin-only or low dose estrogen birth control products; for other exceptions, please contact a milk bank for more information).This is because most of the milk from milk banks goes to very fragile, hospitalized babies (preterm and/or very ill), who may be much more sensitive to a medication in the milk than a healthy, full-term newborn or an older baby would be.When a mother is providing milk to her own baby, most medications and supplements are compatible with breastfeeding. If her baby is premature or seriously ill, she will be specifically checking the safety of each medication she is taking to make sure it is not a problem for her baby (safety may vary depending on babys specific health issues).Since a donors milk may be distributed to many different babies, all with different health issues, it is not possible to tailor each donors medications to each baby so there are overall guidelines instead.Why not just donate your milk mother-to-mother?This is an option, and some mothers prefer it. Informal milk donations are generally between one (or several) specific mothers to a specific baby. Most babies receiving informal breastmilk donations are healthy and are full-term newborns or older, so there are not as many limitations when it comes to medications/supplements that the donor is taking (though this should always be discussed). It is up to the participants to ensure that the milk is handled safely, be aware of and screen for health risks, etc.When you donate to a milk bank, your milk will be going to fragile babies whose very lives may depend on getting donated milk. Milk from these banks is usually the only donor milk available to these babies (informal donations are usually not an option in the NICU), and it is often in short supply.Per Laraine Lockhart Borman, IBCLC, with the Mothers Milk Bank in DenverThe Mothers Milk Bank in Denver dispensed 330,000 ounces of milk to babies in 117 different cities last year. 95% of this milk went to hospitals for their preterm and sick babies. These are children who have been born up to 16 weeks early and may weigh a pound at birth. Because these babies are extremely fragile and will not survive without human milk, the donated milk they receive has a large impact. One ounce can feed a micro preemie in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a full day. The mothers of these tiny babies are many times ill themselves and making milk is difficult for them, or they start out with a good amount and are so stressed out with the condition of their baby that their milk supply suffers.Why do milk banks pasteurize the milk?Image courtesy of the Mothers Milk Bank in DenverMost of the milk from milk banks goes to very fragile, hospitalized babies (preterm and/or very ill). To protect these immune-compromised babies, the milk is pasteurized so that there is no chance of an infectious disease being transmitted through the milk. It is a myth that pasteurization destroys all the good stuff in human milk  most of the nutrients and immune properties remain, and there are many research studies demonstrating the health benefits of banked, pasteurized human milk.Laraine Lockhart Borman, IBCLC, with the Mothers Milk Bank in Denver, CO explainsThe HMBANA Advisory Council, a panel of experts in areas of infectious disease, microbiology, neonatology, law, and other areas, determined that because human milk has the potential to be an agent of infectious disease, pasteurization would be required of all member banks due to the extremely fragile health of the babies receiving this milk. The number one priority is the health and safety of the tiny preterm infants served.With any type of storage or treatment of human milk, there is some loss of its original components. Mothers milk that has been frozen and stored experiences a loss of vitamin A from exposure to light and vitamin C from exposure to freezing temperatures. Pasteurization is a very gentle, controlled heating process using special equipment that kills viruses and bacteria while still maintaining 95% of everything that was originally in the milk. While a few of the immune properties are lost, there are many more that survive the pasteurization process. In addition, some beneficial enzymes are actually activated by the pasteurization process. *Bottom line is that moms own milk is best. When this is not available, pasteurized human milk, obtained from a certified milk bank, can be a lifesaving safe and healthy alternative that everyone can feel good about.Image courtesy of the Mothers Milk Bank in DenverHow does pasteurization affect human milk?From Donor Human Milk for Preterm Infants (Wight 2001):The benefits and concerns regarding the use of human milk for preterm infants has been recently reviewed, with more factors, actions, and interactions being discovered frequently Protective effects of human milk on infection rates have been observed with the use of both fresh and pasteurized milk [note: see Heiman & Schanler 2006 for a recent review]Pasteurization (56 or 62.5C for 30 minutes) does affect some of the nutritional, immunologic and other components of human milk. Heat treatment at 56C (133F) or greater for 30 minutes reliably eliminates all functional white blood cells and bacteria, inactivates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-lymphotropic virus, and decreases the titers of other viruses, but in one study did not eliminate cytomegalovirus (CMV). Holder pasteurization [62.5C (144F) for 30 minutes] reliably inactivates HIV and CMV, and will eliminate or significantly decrease the titers of most other viruses.Immunologic factors are variously affected by heat treatment. With Holder pasteurization most of the secretory IgA, bifid growth factor, and lysozyme remain (0% to 30% destroyed), lipids are unaffected, but 57% of the lactoferrin, and 34% of the IgG are destroyed. The reader is referred to a more detailed recent review (Lawrence 1999).In general, the nutritional components are altered somewhat, resulting in slightly slower growth when compared to infants fed unpasteurized raw human milk. Holder pasteurization does not appear to influence nitrogen absorption or retention in LBW infants. Most enzymes, growth factors, vitamins, and minerals are unchanged or minimally decreased. Heat treatment of donor milk appears to foster more rapid growth of intestinal epithelial cells by inactivating heat-labile inhibitory cytokines, allowing heat-stable epidermal growth factor to act. Freezing inactivates milk cells and most viruses, but does not appear to effect the nutritional or anti-infective quality of the milk. Microwaving clearly decreases the anti-infective properties of human milk; the higher the temperature, the greater the effect.* Research: The effect of pasteurization on the anti-infective agents of human milkPercent activity remaining after pasteurization at 62.5C for 30 minutes (unless otherwise noted)Cells78% macrophagesGibbs 1977No viable cellsLiebhaber 1977Immunoglobulins IgA (total secretory)39%81% (56C for 30 minutes)Stephens 198067%77% (62.5C for 5 minutes)90% (56C for 30 minutes)Wills 198267%Liebhaber 197767%64% (72C for 15 seconds)Goldsmith 198378%Morgan 198680%Ford 197779%Gibbs 197784%Goldblum 198486%Raptopoulou-Gigi 1977100%Evans 1978150% (72C for 15 seconds)Goldblum 1984Some loss (stable if 56C for 30 min)Welsh & May 1979IgG66%Evans 197886%58% (72C for 15 seconds)Goldsmith 1983IgMSubstantial lossLiebhaber 1977NoneGoldsmith 1983NoneFord 1977EnzymesLactoperoxidase53%Friend 1983Lipase45%Friend 1983Protease27%Friend 1983Lysozyme61%Friend 198364%Gibbs 197767%96% (62.5C for 5 min)106% (56C for 30 minutes)Wills 198276%Evans 1978105%Ford 1977393% (72C for 15 seconds)Goldblum 1984Lactoferrin27%Wills 198233%Welsh & May 197936%Goldsmith 198335%Ford 197743%Evans 1978123% (72C for 15 seconds)Goldblum 198456%Eyres 1978Bile salt-stimulated lipaseLostWardell 1984OtherNon immunoglobulinStableLaegreid 1986C1  C9DestroyedWelsh & May 1979L Bifidus growth factorStableAntimicrobial activityStable (56C for 30 minutes)Bullen 1972Antiprotozoal activitySome stabilityGillin 1983See also: Effect of heat treatment or storage on antimicrobial factors in human milkMore InformationFind a HMBANA Milk BankAboutHMBANAHuman Milk Banking and Other Donor Milk@ KellyMomReferencesBullen JJ, Rogers HJ, Leigh L.

Perceived Insufficient Milk,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/perceived-insufficient-milk/,"by Diana Cassar-Uhl, MPH, IBCLCImage credit: jcgoforth on flickrBreastfeeding is a public health issue that has drawn the attention of organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization, both of which encourage exclusive breastfeeding (no foods or liquids other than mothers milk) for the first 6 months of an infants life. In the United States, breastfeeding education, promotion, and support is available for an increasing number of mothers who give birth. Because of this, at last analysis, 76.9% of new mothers initiate breastfeedingbreastfeed their babies at least one timein the hospital, but by the 6-month mark, 43.5% are breastfeeding at all and only 16.4% are exclusively breastfeeding (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). In a study of over 1000 mothers, approximately 60% of them stopped breastfeeding earlier than they were planning to continue before their babies were born, and they cited concerns about difficulty with lactation, their babies nutrition or weight gain, their own illness or need to take medicine, and the effort required to pump breastmilk (Odom, Li, Scanlon, Perrine, & Grummer-Strawn, 2013).Mothers concerns that lead them to stop breastfeeding earlier than the recommended time may be related to their expectations of how infants are supposed to behave. After generations of bottle-feeding, many families have lost the ability to pass along the wisdom and knowledge of how a normal, breastfed infant behaves. Without being taught about how long a normal, healthy baby can go between feedings, what typical sleep-wake patterns of a newborn are really like, and what babies do when they are first hungry (before they start to cry, which is a late-stage hunger cue) mothers may struggle to feel confident in their bodies ability to produce enough milk. Babies who are fed a breastmilk substitute typically space out feedings or sleep longer between feedings than those fed human milk because non-human milks are difficult for babies to digest. Mothers may perceive these normal needs to breastfeed more often, especially through the night, as a sign that their milk is not adequate, either in quality or quantity. This may lead to early, unnecessary supplementation, which may then be followed by a real decrease in milk production; the baby stays asleep longer while breaking down the less-digestible proteins in a breastmilk substitute, and the mothers body does not receive the signal that more milk needs to be made (Walker, 2007). These misunderstandings, perhaps the result of incomplete or absent education about normal infant behavior or lack of availability of local breastfeeding support, often cause a mother to perceive a breastfeeding or lactation problem that may not actually be present.Perceived Insufficient MilkPerceived low milk production, also called Perceived Insufficient Milk (Neifert & Bunik, 2013), is present when a mother is producing enough milk for her baby, but she believes she is not, often because she incorrectly assigns certain normal behaviors of her baby as hunger or dissatisfaction at the breast. There are several factors that can contribute to perceived lactation insufficiency. Socio-cultural influences, such as a worried, insistent grandmother who thinks the baby just ate and therefore cant possibly need to feed again can undermine a mothers confidence in whether she can satisfy her babys appetite. Mismanagement of breastfeeding through a scheduling regime, as is encouraged by popular baby-training programs such as On Becoming Babywise (Ezzo & Bucknam, 1995) and Growing Kids Gods Way (Ezzo & Ezzo, 1993) can also wreak havoc on how a mother is able to decipher her babys cues, since she is taught to watch the clock to determine when to feed the baby, not his signals that he is hungry. Normal lactation physiology, such as whether a woman believes her breasts are large enough, or whether she leaks milk, feels engorged, or experiences a sensation of let down when the milk begins to flow can also affect a mothers perception of her ability to produce milk, even though these feelings are not predictive of milk output. The womans psychological state, especially if she is depressed or anxious about her ability to care for the infant she has given birth to, can contribute to perceived lactation insufficiency (Dykes & Williams, 1999). Without qualified, competent, consistent breastfeeding support in every community, it is difficult to truly assess how many mothers struggle with Perceived Insufficient Milk or a true inability to exclusively breastfeed their babies. Research does indicate a relationship between a perceived difficult infant temperament and less understanding of infant cues (McMeekin, Jansen, Mallan, Nicholson, Magarey, & Daniels, 2013)a baby that is fussy or vocal about his needs may be perceived as hungry, even if he is not, and his mother may conclude that she is unable to produce enough milk for him. Even though we dont always know whether a mother might have made enough milk with competent intervention and support, Perceived Insufficient Milk, including concerns about milk supply and whether the baby is growing enough, has consistently emerged among the most common reasons mothers introduce supplemental bottles of infant formula or stop breastfeeding altogether (Li, Fein, Chen, & Grummer-Strawn, 2008; Gatti, 2008; Ahluwalia, Morrow, & Hsia, 2005).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.As we continue to identify risk factors for lactation insufficiency (variations in infant oral anatomy, hypoplastic breast appearance or insufficient glandular development, high pre-pregnant body mass index, insulin resistance, other hormonal irregularities), it is extremely important that mothers, whether they believe they are at risk or not, identify appropriate breastfeeding support before their babies are born. A prenatal breastfeeding class should teach all families how to recognize when breastfeeding is going well and what to do if it isnt. Obtaining qualified, competent help early can make a huge difference in milk supply whether the problem is the result of inaccurate information about normal newborn behavior or an actual problem with lactation.Resources:Is Your Milk Supply Really Low?@Podcast by Diana Cassar-Uhl:Low Milk SupplyAhluwalia, I.

My power went out and I have breastmilk in the freezer – Help!,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/frozen-milk-power-outage/,"Credit: NASA/GSFC/Jeff Schmaltz/MODIS Land Rapid Response TeamAre you a mom who needs to pump and uses an electric pump?Consider getting a car adapter and/or a battery pack for your electric pump. Some electric pumps can also be converted to manual use  learn how to do this ahead of time.Consider getting a hand pump to use as your back-up pump.Learn how to hand express your milk.Preventing your expressed milk from thawingThe first order of business is to try and prevent the milk from completely thawing. If there are still ice crystals in the milk, then it is still considered frozen it is safe to either use the milk or return it to a working freezer.Some ways to keep your milk frozen:If you have access to a generator, use it to operate your freezer during a power outage.If a neighbor or a nearby store has power, ask if you can store your milk in their freezer until power is restored. Make sure your milk has contact information on it!In your freezer (with no power): Open the freezer as little as possible. Food will stay frozen longer if the freezer is full: if you know ahead of time that you may lose power, fill empty spaces in your freezer with containers of water so that there is extra ice instead of empty space. Keep your expressed milk in the middle of the freezer, away from freezer walls. According to the USDA, a full freezer will hold the temperature for approximately 48 hours (24 hours if it is half full) if the door remains closed.In a cooler: Pack the cooler as full as possible, to slow thawing. Crumpled newspaper is a good insulator if there is extra air space in the cooler. Covering the cooler with blankets will also help to keep it cold.Extra air space in your freezer or cooler can be filled withdry ice, Techni Ice, blue ice, containers of water or ice, or snow.Are you in an area with snow on the ground? You may be able to store your milk in a snow bank, out of the sun, or use snow/ice to keep your milk cool in your freezer or cooler.What if the milk has completely thawed?Credit: NASAs Earth Observatory on FlickerCurrent guidelines recommend that this milk be used within 24-48 hours (24 hours if baby is a preemie or has immune issues that require stricter precautions) and not refrozen.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.According to the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicines 2010 Clinical Protocol #8: Human Milk Storage Information for Home Use for Full-Term Infants:There is little information on refreezing of thawed human milk. Bacterial growth and loss of antibacterial activity in thawed milk will vary depending on the technique of milk thawing, duration of the thaw, and the amount of bacteria in the milk at the time of expression. At this time no recommendations can be made on the refreezing of thawed human milk.However, there is some information on refreezing human milk. A 2006 study looked at the effects of refreezing previously frozen milk (Rechtman, Lee, & Berg, 2006). The researchers used donor milk that had been expressed by mothers without following any special sanitary guidelines. The frozen milk was thawed overnight at refrigerator temperature, separated into batches, then refrozen in separate batches and thawed for a second time to room temperature. At this point, different batches were (1) kept at 46F/8C for 8 or 24 hours; (2) kept at 73F/23C for 4 or 8 hours; (3) exposed to multiple freeze-thaw cycles of various lengths; and (control) kept at -4F/-20C. Vitamin content was adequate for all the refrozen samples, and none of the sample batches that had been refrozen had unsafe levels of bacteria.From the conclusion to this study:The data generated by the authors support the contention that milk is relatively robust. Milk that has been left unrefrigerated for less than 8 hours, or placed in the refrigerator for a day, is safe to use and retains a good portion of its nutritional value. Moreover, it appears that unpasteurized milk that has been accidentally thawed remains safe to use provided it has not been left too long in an unthawed condition. Based on these data, it appears that unpasteurized milk that has thawed in the refrigerator for up to 8 hours may be safely refrozen. Moreover, this data would seem to support the use of frozen milk to which fresh milk has been added and then refrozen. This should allow for more convenient storage and for the salvage of milk that mothers might otherwise have been told to discard.Rechtman DJ, Lee ML, Berg H.

This could be anything betweenexclusive breastfeeding and being put to the breast once. Baby may be receiving other foods or liquids.Complementary Breastmilk  Baby receives both breastmilk and other foods/liquids (which could include formula, juice, solid foods, teas, water, etc.).Exclusive Breastmilk  Baby receives breastmilk only  no water, tea, formula, juice, cereal, solid foods, etc. Baby can receive drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines) and still be considered exclusively breastfed. Most babies are ready to start solid foods around 6 months of age, so the extent of exclusive breastfeeding is not often measured past 6 months.Breastmilk includes the mothers own milk (either at the breast or expressed) and/or another mothers milk (including banked milk, other donor milk, or wet nursing)5/26/12 Update: Graphics added for Ireland and Norway.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.More:Breastfeeding: The Numbers  Breastfeeding rates in the United States and worldwideInfant and young child feeding by country from UNICEFs ChildInfo.orgReferencesAustralia:Growing Up In Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, Annual Report 2006-07.

There may be times when, for a variety of reasons, nursing mothers need or want to leave their nursing baby with a caregiver. This information is intended as a guide for the caregiver of a breastfed baby, so she/he can better understand how to care for the baby and the expressed breastmilk left for the babys use.Supporting Breastfeeding in Child Care (PDF) from the Canadian Child Care FederationTen Steps to Breastfeeding Friendly Child Care Centers Resource Kit (PDF)  A resource kit from the state of Wisconsin to assist child care providers and community groups to implement strategies to promote, protect and support breastfeeding women. The kit includes a self-appraisal tool and information and resources for planning and implementing action plan based on the ten steps. Child care center staff can earn continuing education units.Occasionally, a child care provider will tell mom that baby must switch to whole cows milk at a year old. This is due to a misinterpretation of USDA program rules. The USDAs Child and Adult Care Food Program underwrites the cost of food and labor (for preparing and serving food) at day care centers for both children and the elderly, afterschool care programs, emergency shelters, etc. To keep their funding, businesses that participate in this program must follow certain guidelines when it comes to the foods that are served. After the age of 12 months, the USDA specifies that the child be fed whole milk (which the USDA assumes will be whole cows milk), but the FDA notes that Breastmilk meets the requirement of a milk substitute and can be served to children over the age of 12 months. Mom may need to have a note on file saying that she is providing expressed breastmilk for her child (a medical statement is not required), and the facility will need to document that the parent provided breastmilk (or any other foods) so they will get credit for having provided the proper foods even if they did not purchase all of them.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.CACFP Handbook: Independent Child Care Centers(May 2014)For some breastfed infants who regularly consume less than the minimum amount of breastmilk per feeding, a serving of less than the minimum amount of breastmilk may be offered, with additional breastmilk offered if the infant is still hungry.If a parent requires their toddler to receive breastmilk, is the meal reimbursable?

Mother-2-Mother Concerns: Fussiness,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/m2m-fussiness/,"Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.Young babies, both breast and formula fed, are often fussy. It is not unusual for this to happen during the late afternoon and evenings, and is usually NOT due to hunger, wet/dirty diaper, or anything that mom or dad can fix. It is usually NOT related to milk supply, although some mothers may worry about this.One of the best explanations of normal infant fussiness is shared here with permission from Kathy S. Kuhn RN BSN IBCLC and lactation consultant for iVillage.com:Normal infant fussiness starts at about 1-3 weeks, peaks at about 6-8 weeks and is gone by about 3-4 months. Most babies will fuss about 2-4 hours per day, no matter what you do. They want to be in arms or at the breast very frequently and fuss even though you attempt to calm them. They often seem unsatisfied with their feedings and even seem to reject or cry at the breast.It most commonly happens in the evening hours, and usually the baby will take their longest stretch of sleep after this fussy time. The best thing to do is offer the breast as much as the baby wants it. If she fusses at the breast try to calm her in other ways such as dancing with her, gentle bouncing and rocking, and just giving big doses of TLC. You can tell it is normal fussiness if it occurs about the same time each day, if your baby has other times of the day when feedings are calm and she seems happy, and if she is growing and gaining well per her pediatrician and having plenty of wet and soiled diapers.Many times during a babys fussy time they will refuse the breast. After several frustrating attempts at nursing, the parents may break down and offer a bottle of expressed breastmilk or formula thinking that the fussiness is related to low supply or something wrong with moms milk. Kathy gives a better understanding of this particular concern here, as well as explaining what happens when baby is offered a bottle and guzzles it down:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Parents who dont know this is normal frequently respond as you did by giving a bottle because they think the baby isnt happy or satisfied with the breast. When the bottle goes in the babys mouth the mouth fills with milk, the baby is obligated to swallow and the action of swallowing initiates another suck. The suck again fills the mouth and the cycle repeats, giving an appearance of the baby gulping the bottle down hungrily.This of course only contributes to mom and dads fear that the baby wasnt getting enough at the breast and they keep offering more and more bottles (understandably). Which then causes a true low milk supply. Often the baby falls asleep peacefully after this episode which also reinforces to the parents that the bottle was just what the baby needed. What has really happened is the baby has by coincidence come to the natural conclusion of the fussy spell (most parents give the bottle as a last resort which means the fussiness has been going on for awhile) and/or the baby has withdrawn because gulping down the bottle was actually stressful and NOT what the baby wanted but she could not stop the flow, so exhausted, she falls asleep. So dont offer bottles during any fussy time.Colic and the Breastfed BabyColic is usually defined as sudden and unexplained outbursts of inconsolable crying. According to Dr William Sears, in The Baby Book, if you wonder whether or not you have a colicky baby  you dont!Colic results in at least three hours a day, three days per week, for at least three weeks of inconsolable crying. It usually begins in the first three weeks of life and seldom lasts longer than 3 months. The baby is often healthy and thriving.You may hear any or all of the following: It must be your milk, its.:too weaksomething you are eatingtoo strongor..you feed him too muchyoure not feeding him enoughyou hold him too muchyou dont hold him enough it can be frustrating for mom and dad to try to figure out what is going on.There are many myths as to what may cause colic, which science has (thankfully) offered some info to either support or dispel, and many folk remedies to treat it (be careful with these!). Too often ALL segments of crying are labeled as colic, and it may take some good detective work to determine if it is true colic or a result of something else. Dr Jack Newmans page on colic is an excellent starting place. Additional information can be found at Dr. Sears website and Dr. Jay Gordons website.FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Given the documented short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding, infant nutrition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice [1]. Physical separation of mother and baby presents a medical need for expressed breastmilk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.[MOMs NAME] and her [SON/DAUGHTER] are separated for approximately 10 hours a day 5 days a week and occasionally for extended periods of approximately 2 weeks. Breastmilk accounts for greater than 50% of her [SON/DAUGHTER]s caloric intake and there is no comparable substitute for the immunological properties her breastmilk provides. During these periods of separation, a breastpump is the only means for providing breastmilk to her [SON/DAUGHTER]. Therefore, [MOMs NAME] requires a quality double-electric breastpump (such as the Hygeia EnJoye), any necessary replacement parts, and/or a quality manual pump.In addition to providing optimal nourishment and antibodies for [MOMs NAME]s [SON/DAUGHTER] during periods of separation, using a breastpump addresses the following medical conditions for [MOMs NAME]: (1) prevents engorgement of the breasts (ICD-9 code 676.24); (2) reduces the risk of plugged milk ducts and treats plugged milk ducts should they occur (ICD-9 code675.24); (3) reduces the risk of mastitis (ICD-9 code 675.14 or 675.24); (4) maintains milk supply/prevents suppressed lactation (ICD-9 code 676.54).Sincerely,[DOCS NAME][1] American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding.

J Hum Lact. 2002 May;18(2):172-7.Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) adds significantly to the cost of care for premature infants and to negative long-term and short-term outcomes for these infants. It is thus in the best interest of the health care system to prevent the occurrence of NEC through feeding protocols that foster NEC prevention (i.e., use of breast milk in the neonatal intensive care unit). Banked donor milk has been shown to be as effective in preventing NEC as mothers milk. Three models of cost analysis are presented to show savings that could accrue to a health care system or individual family if banked donor milk were provided as first feedings when mothers milk is not available. The cost of using banked donor milk to feed premature infants is inconsequential when compared to the savings from NEC prevention.Wight NE.Donor human milk for preterm infants. J Perinatol. 2001 Jun;21(4):249-54.As survival rates for preterm infants improve, more attention is being focused on improving the quality of survival through optimal nutritional management. The benefits of human milk for term infants are well recognized, with current research suggesting that human milk may especially benefit the preterm infant. Some mothers are unable or unwilling to provide breastmilk for their infants. Although not as well studied as mothers own milk, pasteurized donor human milk can provide many of the components and benefits of human milk while eliminating the risk of transmission of infectious agents. Pasteurization does affect some of the nutritional and immunologic components of human milk, but many immunoglobulins, enzymes, hormones, and growth factors are unchanged or minimally decreased. In California donor human milk costs approximately $3.00 per ounce to purchase. A reduction in length of stay, necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis may result in a relative saving of approximately $11 to the NICU or healthcare plan for each $1 spent for pasteurized donor milk.The Economic Benefits of Breastfeeding: A Review and Analysisby Jon Weimer. ERS Food Assistance and Nutrition Research Report No. 13. 20 pp, March 2001.A minimum of $3.6 billion would be saved if breastfeeding were increased from current levels (64 percent in-hospital, 29 percent at 6 months) to those recommended by the U.S. Surgeon General (75 and 50 percent). This figure is likely an underestimation of the total savings because it represents cost savings from the treatment of only three childhood illnesses: otitis media, gastroenteritis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. This report reviews breastfeeding trends and previous studies that assessed the economic benefits of breastfeeding.Health Care Costs of Formula-feeding in the First Year of Lifeby Thomas M. Ball, MD, MPH and Anne L. Wright, PhD, published inPediatricsVol. 103 No. 4 April 1999, pp. 870-876.In the first year of life, after adjusting for confounders, there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. These additional health care services cost the managed care health system between $331 and $475 per never-breastfed infant during the first year of life In addition to having more illnesses, formula-fed infants cost the health care system money. Health care plans will likely realize substantial savings, as well as providing improved care, by supporting and promoting exclusive breastfeeding.Cost Benefits of Breastfeeding(1997) by Karen M. Zeretzke, MEd, IBCLCTotal Annual Cost of not Breastfeeding: $1.186 to $1.301 BillionStudy of the costs of not breastfeeding(1997) by Dr. Jan RiordanBreastfeeding, a valuable natural resource, promotes health, helps prevent infant and childhood disease, and saves health care costs. Additional national health care costs, incurred for treatment of four medical conditions in infants who were not breastfed were estimated. Infant diarrhea in non-breastfed infants costs $291.3 million; respiratory syncytial virus, $225 million; insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, from $9.6 to $124.8 million; and otitis media, $660 million. Thus, these four medical diagnoses alone create just over a billion dollars of extra health care costs each year.Kaiser Permanentes Study on Breastfeeding and Health(data from 1992-1993)Infants who were breastfed for a minimum of 6 months experienced $1,435.00 less health care claims than formula fed infants.TABLE 2Amount of formula needed per day[click here for amount ofexpressed

How much expressed milk will my baby need?,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/milkcalc/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCHow much milk do babies need?What if baby is eating solid foods?Is baby drinking too much or too little expressed milk?Other ways of estimating milk intakeReferencesImage credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrHow much milk do babies need?Many mothers wonder how much expressed breastmilk they need to have available if they are away from baby.In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months (though it likely increases short term during growth spurts). Current breastfeeding research does not indicate that breastmilk intake changes with babys age or weight between one and six months. After six months, breastmilk intake will continue at this same level until  sometime after six months, depending in babys intake from other foods  babys milk intake begins to decrease gradually (see below).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The research tells us that exclusively breastfed babies take in an average of 25 oz (750 mL) per day between the ages of 1 month and 6 months. Different babies take in different amounts of milk; a typical range of milk intakes is 19-30 oz per day (570-900 mL per day).We can use this information to estimate the average amount of milk baby will need at a feeding:Estimate the number of times that baby nurses per day (24 hours).Then divide 25 oz by the number of nursings.This gives you a ballpark figure for the amount of expressed milk your exclusively breastfed baby will need at one feeding.Example: If baby usually nurses around 8 times per day, you can guess that baby might need around 3 ounces per feeding when mom is away.

Because of the great variability in the amount of solids that babies take during the second six months, the amount of milk will vary, too. One study found average breastmilk intake to be 30 oz per day (875 ml/day; 93% of total intake) at 7 months and 19 oz (550 ml/day; 50% of total energy intake) at 11-16 months.Several studies have measured breastmilk intake for babies between 12 and 24 months and found typical amounts to be 14-19 oz per day (400-550 mL per day). Studies looking at breastmilk intake between 24 and 36 months have found typical amounts to be 10-12 oz per day (300-360 mL per day).Is baby drinking too much or too little expressed milk?Keep in mind that the amount of milk that baby takes at a particular feeding will vary, just as the amount of food and drink that an adult takes throughout the day will vary. Baby will probably not drink the same amount of milk at each feeding. Watch babys cues instead of simply encouraging baby to finish the bottle.If your baby is taking substantially more than the average amounts, consider the possibility that baby is being given too much milk while you are away. Things that can contribute to overfeeding include:Fast flow bottles. Always use the lowest flow bottle nipple that baby will tolerate. Even with a slower flowing nipple, it is important to pace the bottle feed to allow baby to better control his intake.Using bottle feeding as the primary way to comfort baby. Some well-meaning caregivers feed baby the bottle every time he makes a sound. Use the calculator above to estimate the amount of milk that baby needs, and start with that amount. If baby still seems to be hungry, have your caregiver first check to see whether baby will settle with walking, rocking, holding, etc. before offering another ounce or two.Babys need to suck. Babies have a very strong need to suck, and the need may be greater while mom is away (sucking is comforting to baby). A baby can control the flow of milk at the breast and will get minimal milk when he mainly needs to suck. When drinking from a bottle, baby gets a larger constant flow of milk as long as he is sucking. If baby is taking large amounts of expressed milk while you are away, you might consider encouraging baby to suck fingers or thumb, or consider using a pacifier for the times when mom is not available, to give baby something besides the bottle to satisfy his sucking needs.If, after trying these suggestions, youre still having a hard time pumping enough milk, see Im not pumping enough milk. What can I do?If baby is taking significantly less expressed milk than the average, it could be that baby is reverse-cycling, where baby takes just enough milk to take the edge off his hunger, then waits for mom to return to get the bulk of his calories. Baby will typically nurse more often and/or longer than usual once mom returns. Some mothers encourage reverse cycling so they wont need to pump as much milk. Reverse cycling is common for breastfed babies, especially those just starting out with the bottle.If your baby is reverse cycling, here are a few tips:Be patient. Try not to stress about it. Consider it a compliment  baby prefers you!Use small amounts of expressed milk per bottle so there is less waste.If youre worrying that baby cant go that long without more milk, keep in mind that some babies sleep through the night for 8 hours or so without mom needing to worry that baby is not eating during that time period. Keep an eye on wet diapers and weight gain to assure yourself that baby is getting enough milk.Ensure that baby has ample chance to nurse when youre together.Other ways of estimating milk intakeThere are various ways of estimating the amount of milk intake related to the weight of the baby and the age of the baby, based upon formula intake  research has shown that after the early weeks these methods overestimate the amount of milk that baby actually needs. These are the estimates that we used for breastfed babies for years, with the caveat that most breastfed babies dont take as much expressed milk as estimated by these methods. Current research tells us that breastmilk intake is quite constant after the first month and does not appreciably increase with age or weight, so the current findings are validating what moms and lactation counselors have observed all along.The Milk Calculator from the The Adoptive Breastfeeding Resource Website does this type of estimation.More:Breast Versus Bottle: How much milk should baby take?

How does milk production work?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/milkproduction/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCTo understand how to effectively increase (or decrease) milk supply, we need to look at how milk production worksFor the most part, milk production is a use it or lose it process. The more often and effectively your baby nurses, the more milk you will make.In the BeginningEstablished LactationWhat does current research tell us about milk production?Feedback Inhibitor of LactationProlactin receptorsWhat drives milk synthesis?Storage capacityWhat does the research tell us about increasing milk supply?Additional informationReferencesIn the BeginningEndocrine (Hormonal) Control of Milk Synthesis  Lactogenesis I & IIMilk production doesnt start out as a supply and demand process. During pregnancy and the first few days postpartum, milk supply is hormonally driven  this is called the endocrine control system. Essentially, as long as the proper hormones are in place, mom will start making colostrum about halfway through pregnancy (Lactogenesis I) and her milk will increase in volume (Lactogenesis II) around 30-40 hours after birth.During the latter part of pregnancy, the breasts are making colostrum, but high levels of progesterone inhibit milk secretion and keep the volume turned down. At birth, the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone/estrogen/HPL levels. This abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels cues Lactogenesis II (copious milk production). Other hormones (insulin, thyroxine, cortisol) are also involved, but their roles are not yet well understood. Although biochemical markers indicate that Lactogenesis II commences approximately 30-40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk coming in) until 50-73 hours (2-3 days) after birth.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.These first two stages of lactation are hormonally driven  they occur whether or not a mother is breastfeeding her baby.Established LactationAutocrine (Local) Control of Milk Synthesis  Lactogenesis IIIAfter Lactogenesis II, there is a switch to the autocrine (or local) control system. This maintenance stage of milk production is also called Lactogenesis III. In the maintenance stage, milk synthesis is controlled at the breast  milk removal is the primary control mechanism for supply. Milk removal is driven by babys appetite. Although hormonal problems can still interfere with milk supply, hormonal levels play a much lesser role in established lactation. Under normal circumstances, the breasts will continue to make milk indefinitely as long as milk removal continues.By understanding how local/autocrine control of milk synthesis works, we can gain an understanding of how to effectively increase (or decrease) milk supply.What does current research tell us about milk production?Current research suggests that there are two factors that control milk synthesis:Milk contains a small whey protein called Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation (FIL)  the role of FIL appears to be to slow milk synthesis when the breast is full. Thus milk production slows when milk accumulates in the breast (and more FIL is present), and speeds up when the breast is emptier (and less FIL is present).The hormone prolactin must be present for milk synthesis to occur. On the walls of the lactocytes (milk-producing cells of the alveoli) are prolactin receptor sites that allow the prolactin in the blood stream to move into the lactocytes and stimulate the synthesis of breastmilk components. When the alveolus is full of milk, the walls expand/stretch and alter the shape of prolactin receptors so that prolactin cannot enter via those receptor sites  thus rate of milk synthesis decreases. As milk empties from the alveolus, increasing numbers of prolactin receptors return to their normal shape and allow prolactin to pass through  thus rate of milk synthesis increases. The prolactin receptor theory suggests that frequent milk removal in the early weeks will increase the number of receptor sites. More receptor sites means that more prolactin can pass into the lactocytes and thus milk production capability would be increased.Both of the above factors support research findings that tell us:FULLBreast = SLOWERMilkProductionEMPTYBreast = FASTERMilkProductionResearch indicates that fat content of the milk is also determined by how empty the breast is (emptier breast = higher fat milk), rather than by the time of day or stage of the feed.How does milk supply vary throughout the day?Earlier researchers observed that milk volume is typically greater in the morning hours (a good time to pump if you need to store milk), and falls gradually as the day progresses. Fat content tends to increase as the day progresses (Hurgoiu V, 1985). These observations are consistent with current research if we assume the researchers were observing babies with a fairly typical nursing pattern, where baby has a longer sleep period at night and gradually decreases the amount of time between nursing as the day progresses.Storage capacity: Another factor that affects milk production and breastfeeding management is moms milk storage capacity. Storage capacity is the amount of milk that the breast can store between feedings. This can vary widely from mom to mom and also between breasts for the same mom. Storage capacity is not determined by breast size, although breast size can certainly limit the amount of milk that can be stored. Moms with large or small storage capacities can produce plenty of milk for baby. A mother with a larger milk storage capacity may be able to go longer between feedings without impacting milk supply and babys growth. A mother with a smaller storage capacity, however, will need to nurse baby more often to satisfy babys appetite and maintain milk supply since her breasts will become full (slowing production) more quickly. Think of storage capacity as a cup  you can easily drink a large amount of water throughout the day using any size of cup  small, medium or large  but if you use a smaller cup it will be refilled more often.What does the research tell us about increasing milk supply?Milk is being produced at all times, with speed of production depending upon how empty the breast is. Milk collects in moms breasts between feedings, so the amount of milk stored in the breast between feedings is greater when more time has passed since the last feed. The more milk in the breast, the slower the speed of milk production.To speed milk synthesis and increase daily milk production, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this quickly and frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings:EMPTYBreast = FASTERMilkProductionIn practice, this means that a mother who wishes to increase milk supply should aim to keep the breasts as empty as possible throughout the day.To accomplish this goal and increase milk production:Empty the breasts more frequently (by nursing more often and/or adding pumping sessions between nursing sessions)Empty the breasts as thoroughly as possible at each nursing/pumping session.To better empty the breasts:Make sure baby is nursing efficiently.Use breast massage and compression.Offer both sides at each nursing; wait until baby is finished with the first side before offering the second. Switch nursing may be helpful if baby is not draining the breast well.Pump after nursing if baby does not adequately soften both breasts. If baby empties the breasts well, then pumping is more useful if done between nursing sessions (in light of our goal to keep the breasts as empty as possible). Are you having problems with oversupply?Mothers who are working to remedy oversupply usually need to decrease supply without decreasing overall nursing frequency or weaning baby. One way to accomplish this is by block nursing  mom nurses baby as frequently as usual but restricts baby to one breast for a set period of time (often 3-4 hours but sometimes longer) before switching sides. In this way, more milk accumulates in the breast before mom switches sides (thus slowing milk production) but babys nursing frequency is not limited.See also:Frequently Asked Questions about Milk ProductionIm confused about foremilk and hindmilk  how does this work?Anatomy of the human breast.

Frequently Asked Questions about Milk Production,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/basics/milkproduction-faq/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCHow does milk production change over the course of lactation?Im confused about foremilk and hindmilk  how does this work?What happens between feedings?Do breasts need time to refill?How does milk production change over the course of lactation?For the first few days, up to and including the point at which moms milk comes in, milk production does not depend upon milk being removed from the breast. After those first few days, it is necessary for milk to be regularly removed from the breast (via baby or pump) to continue milk production. The breasts will begin to shut down milk production within several days if milk is not regularly and effectively removed.cc Flickr Graham HellewellDuring the early weeks, assuming nursing is going well, a mom will often have more milk than baby needs. Many moms also experience varying degrees of leaking and/or breast fullness/engorgement in the early weeks  this is not the norm for the entire breastfeeding experience but simply a period of adjustment as moms body determines and adjusts to the amount of milk her baby (or babies) actually needs.In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months (though it likely increases short term during growth spurts). Current breastfeeding research does not indicate that breastmilk intake changes with babys age or weight between one and six months. Sometime between six months and a year (as solids are introduced and slowly increased) babys milk intake may begin to decrease, but breastmilk should provide the majority of babys nutrition through the first year.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.After the first 6 weeks to 3 months (or sometimes later  this varies for different mothers), the high baseline prolactin level that is the norm in the early weeks gradually decreases to the lower baseline that is the norm for later lactation. Around this time, moms breasts may feel less full, leaking may decrease or stop, let-down may become less noticeable, and pumping output may decrease. These are all normal changes and, on their own, do not mean that milk supply has decreased. Click here to read moreIm confused about foremilk and hindmilk  how does this work?The breast only makes one type of milk, which has a relatively high fat content, but because of the mechanics of milk release, the amount of fat in the milk available to baby gradually changes as a feed progresses. Foremilk is the term for the milk (relatively lower in fat) available at the beginning of a feeding; hindmilk is the term for the milk at the end of a feeding, which has a higher fat content than the milk at the beginning of that particular feeding. There is no sharp distinction between foremilk and hindmilk  the change is very gradual. Research from Peter Hartmanns group tells us that fat content of the milk is primarily determined by the emptiness of the breast  the less milk in the breast, the higher the fat content. Click here to read moreWhat happens between feedings?Milk is produced at all times, not just between feedings. Between feedings, milk collects in moms breasts. Volume of milk stored in the breast is greater when there has been a greater amount of time between feeds. The amount of milk that can be stored in the breast between feedings (milk storage capacity) varies significantly from mom to mom and is not determined by breast size (although breast size can limit storage capacity). For most women there is not a lot of storage room. Although mothers with both low and high milk storage capacities produce enough milk for their babies, mothers with a greater milk storage capacity may be able to go longer between feedings without impacting milk supply and babys growth.Do breasts need time to refill?Many people mistakenly think of a mothers milk supply as being like flesh-covered bottles that are completely emptied and then need time to refill before baby nurses again. This is simply not how we understand milk production to function.First of all, milk is being produced at all times, so the breast is never empty. Research has shown that babies do not take all the milk available from the breast  the amount that baby drinks depends upon his appetite. The amount of milk removed from the breast varies from feed to feed, but averages around 75-80% of the available milk. Trying to completely empty a breast is like trying to empty a river  its impossible, since more milk will keep flowing in while milk is being removed.Research also tells us that the emptier the breast, the faster the breast makes milk. So when baby removes a large percentage of milk from the breast, milk production will speed up in response. Rather than thinking of nursing or pumping as pouring milk out of a container think of it as flipping on the high speed production switch! Yet another analogy: Imagine you are using a straw to drink from a glass of water. As you drink, a friend is very slowly pouring water into your glass. The emptier the glass, the faster your friend pours the water. Would you be able to drink all the water in your glass?Waiting a set amount of time to nurse your baby (under the mistaken belief that breasts need time to refill) is actually counterproductive. Consistently delaying nursing will lead to decreased milk supply over time because milk production slows when milk accumulates in the breast.Return to How does milk production work?FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Foremilk and hindmilk – what does this mean?,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/basics/foremilk-hindmilk/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCNormally the changing fat content of milk doesnt require any thought at all. This is an explanation of how it works, and why it is recommended to allow your baby to finish the first breast before offering the second (instead of switching sides while baby is actively breastfeeding). The breast only makes one type of milk (which has a relatively high fat content). Because of the mechanics of milk release, the amount of fat in the milk available to baby gradually changes as a feed progresses. As milk is produced in the breast, the fat globules in the milk tend to stick to each other and to the walls of the alveoli (where the milk is made). Between feedings, milk collects in the breasts and gradually moves out toward the nipple, leaving more and more of the fat stuck further back in the milk ducts. The more time between milk removal (feeding or expression), the lower the fat content of the milk available to baby at the beginning of the feeding.Foremilk and hindmilk are not different types of milkthey are only terms that refer to whether were looking at milk at the start or end of a feeding. The term foremilk refers to the milk at the beginning of a feeding; hindmilk refers to milk at the end of a feeding, which has a higher fat content than the milk at the beginning of that particular feeding. There is no sharp distinction between foremilk and hindmilkthe change is very gradual. Research from Peter Hartmanns group tells us that fat content of the milk is primarily determined by the emptiness of the breast  the less milk in the breast, the higher the fat content.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Once the let-down (or Milk Ejection Reflex/MER) is triggered (by babys nursing, pumping, etc.), the milk is squeezed down the ducts until it becomes accessible to the baby. Milk production is not faster during letdown  the flow is simply faster. There are several let-downs per feed, although most mothers only sense the first one.As the breast starts to empty, the fat globules begin to dislodge and move down the ducts (let-down facilitates this process). So the further into the feed, the higher the fat content of the milk, as more and more fat globules are forced out. The end result is that the milk gradually increases in fat as the feeding progresses. Your breasts dont flip a switch at some arbitrary point and start producing hindmilk instead of foremilk. Instead, think of the beginning of a nursing session as being like turning on a hot water faucet.The first water you get out of the tap isnt usually hot, but cold. As the water runs, it gradually gets warmer and warmer and warmer. This is what happens with the fat content in moms milk  momss milk gradually increases in fat content until the end of the feeding.Since fat content is is directly related to the degree of emptiness of the breast, it is possible, depending upon nursing pattern, for fat content to be higher at the beginning of a particular feeding than it is at the end of some other feeding.Now think about the hot water faucet again. If there is a long period of time before the faucet is used again, then you go through the cold to hot process once more, but if you turn the water on fairly soon after it was used then the water is either pretty warm or still hot, depending upon how long its been since the faucet was last on.This is how it works with mothers milk too  the longer the time between feedings, the lower the fat content at the beginning of the next feeding. If feedings are closer together, youre starting off with a higher fat content.As a particular feeding progresses, fat content increases, milk volume and flow decrease, and milk synthesis speeds up. Because every baby varies in the amount of time it takes him to receive his fill of the higher-fat milk at the end of the feeding, it is important not to switch breasts while baby is actively nursing.More:Frequently Asked Questions about Milk Production  @ KellyMomHow does milk production work?  @ KellyMomWorries About Foremilk and Hindmilk by Nancy Mohrbacher, IBCLC, FILCAForemilk and Hindmilk: In Quest of an Elusive Arbitrary Switch by Anne-Marie AblettForceful Let-down (Milk Ejection Reflex) & Oversupply @ KellyMomMany thanks to Paula Yount of Mother-2-Mother.com for the great analogy!FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Cluster Feeding and Fussy Evenings,http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/fussy-evening/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIt is very common for babies to be fussy and nurse very often in the evenings, particularly in the early months.My daughter had a fussy time every evening for a couple of months (yes, it does go away!). I spent weeks camped out on the end of the sofa with a constantly nursing and/or fussy baby every evening from about 6 to 10 PM.With my son, we didnt have the luxury of being able to sit down. Alex was unhappy and crying unless he was upright and being walked around at this time of day (and sometimes this only helped him to be less unhappy). He would occasionally have a very fussy time during the day, too. Nursing rarely helped to calm his fussiness (unlike with my daughter), so I usually didnt have that tool to work with (though I always tried). His fussiness was such that I looked into other causes (such as food sensitivity), but we never determined any reason for it and he was all smiles the rest of the time. The fussiness gradually went away between 3 and 4 months, as is the norm, but the first few months were hard. Nowadays, the typical comment that I hear about him is Is he always this happy? So remember: this, too, will pass Cluster feeding, also called bunch feeding, is when babies space feeding closer together at certain times of the day and go longer between feedings at other times. This is very common, and often occurs in the evenings. Its often -but not always- followed by a longer sleep period than usual: baby may be tanking up before a long sleep. For example, your baby may nurse every hour (or even constantly) between 6 and 10 PM, then have a longish stretch of sleep at night  baby may even sleep all night.Cluster feeding often coincides with your babys fussy time. Baby will nurse a few minutes, pull off, fuss/cry, nurse a few minutes, pull off, fuss/cry on and on for hours. This can be VERY frustrating, and mom starts wondering if baby is getting enough milk, if something she is eating is bothering baby, if EVERYTHING she is doing is bothering baby It can really ruin your confidence, particularly if there is someone else around asking the same questions (your mother, your husband, your mother-in-law).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.This behavior is NORMAL! It has nothing to do with your breastmilk or your mothering. If baby is happy the rest of the day, and baby doesnt seem to be in pain (as with colic) during the fussy time  just keep trying to soothe your baby and dont beat yourself up about the cause. Let baby nurse as long and as often as he will. Recruit dad (or another helper) to bring you food/drink and fetch things (book/remote/phone/etc.) while you are nursing and holding baby.Does this mean that baby needs more milk than I can provide?No. Dont give baby a bottle  supplementation will only tell your body that you need LESS milk at this time, and that will not help matters. Also, keep in mind that formula fed babies experience fussy periods in the evening, too  fussy evenings are common for all young babies, no matter how they are fed. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine spells this out in their supplementary feeding guidelines:There are common clinical situations where evaluation and breastfeeding management may be necessary, but supplementation is NOT INDICATED including The infant who is fussy at night or constantly feeding for several hours.Why do babies fuss in the evening?One frequently-heard explanation for babys fussiness in the evenings is that milk volume tends to be lower in the evening due to the natural cycling of hormones throughout the day. However, Dr. Peter Hartmann, a breastfeeding researcher, has said that in the women he has studied, milk volume is not low at this time of day. Even if milk volume is lower in the evening, fat content is typically higher in the evening (particularly if baby is allowed to control this via cue feeding), so the amount of calories that baby is getting should not be significantly different. Milk flow can be slower in the evening, which may be frustrating for some babies.Doctors often attribute evening fussiness to babys immature nervous system (and the fussiness does end as baby gets older, usually by 3-4 months). However, Dr. Katherine Dettwyler (who does research on breastfeeding in traditional societies) states that babies in Mali, West Africa and other traditional societies dont have colic or late afternoon/evening fussiness. These babies are carried all day and usually nurse several times each hour.So perhaps none of these explanations is a complete answer to babys evening fussiness. For many babies, the fussy time seems to be characterized by a need to have small quantities of milk at frequent intervals, combined with lots of holding, cuddling and movement. Babies who are offered as much expressed milk or formula as they will take by bottle [note: this practice will decrease your milk supply!] often behave in exactly the same way in the evenings. Baby takes a small amount and dozes (and fusses), then a little more, and so on. Perhaps babies remember mom being very active during her pregnancy at these times, and want to be held, rocked, and nurtured constantly again.Perhaps babies simply need to nurse more often at this time  rather than consume more milk.Soothing techniques for the fussy timesWear baby in a sling or baby carrier. This will free one or both hands for other tasks (fixing dinner, caring for other children) while you hold, soothe and nurse your baby.Change of pace. Let dad have some baby time while mom takes a shower or simply gets some time to herself to relax and regroup after a long day.Go outside. Relax baby (and mom too) with a walk, or just sit and enjoy the outdoors. Try this a little before babys regular fussy time.Soothe with sound. Sing, hum, talk, murmur shhhh, listen to music, or use white noise. Try different types of sound, different styles of music and singers with different types of voices.Soothe with rhythmic motion. Walk, sway, bounce, dance, swing, or even try a car ride.Soothe with touch. Hold or bathe baby, try baby massage.Reduce stimulation. Dim lights, reduce noise, swaddle baby.Vary nursing positions.

Do babies under 12 months self-wean?,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/babyselfwean/,"DeutschBy Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIntroductionWhat is self-weaning?What factors might lead mom to think that her baby is self-weaning?Low milk supplyNormal developmental stagesTips for avoiding premature weaningAdditional InformationIntroductionTrue SELF-weaning before a baby is a year old is very uncommon. In fact, it is unusual for a baby to wean before 18-24 months unless mom is encouraging weaning. However, it is very common to hear a mother say that her baby self-weaned at 9 or 10 months old, or even earlier. How do we reconcile these statements?What is self-weaning?A baby who is weaning on his own:is typically well over a year old (more commonly over 2 years)is at the point where he gets most of his nutrition from solidsdrinks well from a cupcuts down on nursing graduallyChild-led weaning occurs when a child no longer has a need to nurse  nutritionally or emotionally. The solids part should rule out self-weaning in babies under a year since, for optimum health and brain development, babies under a year should be getting most of their nutrition from breastmilk.What factors might lead mom to think that her baby is self-weaning?When a mother says that her baby self-weaned before a year, there is a chance that she interpreted a normal developmental stage (perhaps combined with her own wishes) as babys wish to wean. Low milk supply can also play a part.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Low milk supplyIf moms milk supply is reduced, baby may become less interested in nursing, and of course decreased nursing will lead to an even lower milk supply. If milk supply is low, baby may grow to prefer a cup or bottle simply because he can get more milk this way. As long as baby is nursing on cue and removing milk thoroughly, moms breasts will produce the milk that baby needs. There are a number of things that might interfere with the milk production process after lactation has been established. Some factors that commonly come into play in babys second six months include:Scheduled feedings or other things that reduce babys nursing frequency too much (for example, pacifier overuse or sleep training). The answer to how much is too much? will depend on the particular mother-baby pair. A consistent decrease in nursing frequency will signal your body to decrease milk supply.Rapid weight loss. A sudden decrease in moms calorie intake can result in decreased milk supply.Medications or herbs that reduce milk supply (hormonal contraceptives, for example).Early introduction of solids (before 6 months). Besides interfering with babys immunologic health, solids before six months often results in baby taking less milk at the breast and thus results in a decrease in milk supply.Overly rapid increase in the amounts of solids. Again, this results in baby taking too little milk at the breast and thus a decreased milk supply. Keep in mind that moms milk supply will naturally and gradually decrease as baby begins to eat greater quantities of solid foods  this is fine and expected. What you want to avoid is increasing solids/decreasing milk supply too quickly, as breastmilk is what baby needs for proper growth, health and brain development through the first year and beyond.For more on milk supply, including how to increase it, see Got Milk?Normal developmental stagesIt is common and normal for babies to show less interest in breastfeeding sometime during the second six months. This is developmental and not an indication that baby wishes to stop nursing.Older babies tend to be distractible and want to be a part of all the action around them. Your baby may be more interested in learning about the world than in eating during the day (these same babies often increase their night nursing to make up for their busy days).If baby is being given a bottle or sippy cup frequently, he discovers that he can walk/crawl around with it and not miss a thing, whereas nursing generally requires sitting still and not looking around for a few minutes. For this reason, some babies develop a preference for the bottle or cup at this developmental stage.Milestone times, such as crawling and walking, and stressful times like teething or illness can also cause baby to be less interested in nursing  these types of things are common in the second six months. Nursing strikes (when baby quits nursing suddenly) also tend to be more common around this age, perhaps due to the same factors.Our society tends to produce the expectation that babies can and should become independent as quickly as possible. Babies are considered more independent when they sleep alone, sleep through the night, potty train, wean, etc., As a result, babies are often pushed toward these milestones before they are ready  emotionally or physically. Because of this societal mindset, many moms dont even consider the idea that babys disinterest in breastfeeding might be temporary, but simply go ahead and wean.This is not saying that a mothers choice to wean a baby this age is necessarily a bad choice for her family. A mother who wishes to wean her child at this point can certainly take advantage of babys temporary disinterest in nursing to initiate mother-led weaning.However, it should understand that this is not self-weaning but a temporary developmental stage. Mom is making the choice, not baby. Once mom knows that she has a choice in the matter, she can better make an informed decision of whether to wean or to seek the benefits of continued nursing.Tips for avoiding premature weaningThe following suggestions can be helpful in preventing baby from weaning prematurely:Keep breastmilk primary in babys diet during the first yearIf you feel that your milk supply is low, take measures to increase it.Offer breastmilk first, before any solids, through at least the first year. Dont let solids become more important than breastmilk during the first year.Increase solid foods gradually. An example of a gradual increase in solids would be 25% solids at 12 months, 50% solids at 18 months, and 80% solids at 24 months.Sugared drinks (and juice, too) are empty calories and will keep baby from feeling really hungry  limit or eliminate these. Water can also fill baby up and decrease nursing frequency. Click here for suggestions on offering water and juice.Minimize the risk of baby developing a preference for the bottle or cupLimit (or eliminate) bottles. If baby must be supplemented due to separation from mom, then only use bottles when you are physically separated from baby. Use a newborn-flow nipple, no matter how old your baby is, to reduce the risk that baby will grow to prefer the fast flow of a bottle. If baby is older than six months, seriously consider using a cup rather than a bottle.Limit or eliminate pacifier use when you are with baby, so that your babys desire to suck encourages him to nurse more often.Avoid allowing baby to walk around with bottles or sippy cups.If baby is very busy and doesnt want to stop and nurseTry different and novel nursing positions in which he can have more control and perhaps see whats going on around him  baby standing up, sitting on your lap facing you, etc.Try singing, talking, telling stories, playing finger games, reading, etc. while nursing.Try wearing a nursing necklace or bright colored scarf to help hold babys attention when nursing.Give baby a small toy to hold and play with when nursing.Be aware of your own subtle cues that encourage weaningOffer baby the breast often; dont wait until he demands to nurse. Be aware that the dont offer  dont refuse method of breastfeeding is a weaning technique.Be available to nurse when baby wants to. Saying not now, but later is certainly part of the natural give and take of a nursing relationship as your child gets older, but dont overuse it and dont forget the later part  offer to nurse later, rather than waiting for baby to ask.Diversion/distraction by mom is a weaning technique, particularly if used frequently.Avoid limiting times or places for nursing. This is another weaning technique.Allow baby to nurse at night if he wishes. Baby will nurse more often if he is in your room and/or bed, and many families get more sleep this way.If you feel you need to phase out night nursing before baby does it on his own, then it may be helpful to make a conscious effort to increase daytime nursing.Keep in close contact  carry and hold your child often. This will make breastfeeding more accessible to baby. Restricting access to nursing is a weaning technique.Be aware of normal developmental stagesPay attention to your childs natural growth rhythms. Be aware of times that are not true weanings.Additional Information@ The Distractible BabyGot Milk?Child-led Weaning@ other websitesTriple Nipples and Early Weaning by Diane Wiessinger, MS, IBCLCBreastfeeding as Baby Grows by Becky Flora, IBCLCFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding Your Toddler: What to expect,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/toddlernursing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCAre you considering breastfeeding your baby into toddlerhood and wondering how the breastfeeding relationship will change? Are you wondering if your toddler is trying to wean, or wondering why your toddler is suddenly breastfeeding round the clock? Here are a few observations on typical toddler breastfeeding behavior. As always, the way your particular baby approaches nursing will also depend on her unique personality. Julia Shilova - Fotolia.comHow long do breastfeeding sessions last?How often do toddlers breastfeed?What breastfeeding positions work best for toddlers?Acrobatic breastfeedingIf I breastfeed past a year, will it be harder to wean?What is child-led weaning like?How long do breastfeeding sessions last?First off, its really normal for the breastfeeding sessions to get shorter as baby gets older  this doesnt necessarily mean that baby is getting ready to wean. As baby gets older, she can get milk more efficiently (by this time your baby is an expert nurser) so she doesnt need as much time to get the same amount. Another factor that comes into play is distraction  baby gets so interested in the other things going on around her that she doesnt like to take the time to nurse as long. A typical toddler nursing session may last only a couple of minutes  just enough time to take a sip and reconnect with mom for a moment before running off to do toddler things. Naptime, nighttime, and waking up nursing sessions usually last longer, since baby is usually sleepy and not as intent on jumping into the middle of things.How often do toddlers breastfeed?Breastfeeding frequency for toddlers is usually pretty erratic and varies greatly from child to child. Its normal for toddlers to be interested in everything around them and, as a result, not as interested in breastfeeding. At other times, baby will be so focused on the big changes within herself (developmentally), that she will want to spend lots of time at the breast to reconnect with mom and adjust to all the new skills in her life. Some children breastfeed often (like a newborn is a frequent comment that you hear from the moms of 12-15 month olds), some breastfeed only once or twice a day, and some breastfeed a few times a day on some days and frequently on others. No matter what the breastfeeding pattern, average breastfeeding frequency decreases gradually as baby gets older. Once or twice a day breastfeeding sessions can continue for months and even years, depending upon the child and mom.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Toddlers breastfeed for comfort, in addition to nutrition. Breastfeeding can work wonders when baby is hurt, sad, upset (nursing is a great tantrum-tamer), or sick. Toddlers may also use breastfeeding as a quick way of checking in and reconnecting with mom throughout the day.Sometimes your toddler may go through phases of increased night nursing. Common reasons for increased night breastfeeding in toddlers include teething, decreased breastfeeding during the day because of distraction, developmental advances and reconnecting with mom.It is typical for a toddler to breastfeed more often when away from home for a few days, or when there are other big changes in the typical day-to-day routine. To a toddler, breastfeeding is warmth, comfort, reassurance its their home away from home that they tend to retreat to when things are unfamiliar or uncertain. Once you are back at home and settled in (or once your child has adjusted to the change, regardless of what it was), the increased breastfeeding tends to fall by the wayside.What breastfeeding positions work best for toddlers?Positioning just depends upon what is comfortable for you and baby, and will evolve as baby gets older. Positioning (and sometimes latch) most always get rather casual over time, and as long as this works for you and baby it is not a problem. However, sometimes mom will get sore nipples or may feel babys top teeth. In these cases, its a good idea to look into making some changes in positioning or latch.Acrobatic breastfeedingBy toddlerhood, most babies have quite a repertoire of creative breastfeeding positions. Acrobatic breastfeeding is typical and its common for baby to try breastfeeding upside down, with feet in the air, standing on one foot, wiggling and twisting and turning, and so on. Enjoy the silly positions they try, be flexible and patient, but if the acrobatic breastfeeding gets to be a problem, here are tips that have helped other moms:Give it a little time. Exhibits of the most intense acrobats are generally a phase that shows up when baby figures out that she can nurse in a million different positions and, whats more, its fun to try. The novelty will wear off after a little time and the acrobatics will decrease.Give baby something to hold and play with while nursing (a small toy, perhaps). Some moms also wear a nursing necklace to focus babys attention on something other than acrobatics.Try talking or reading a book to your child while you nurse. Songs or fingerplays can also help.Try a firm reprimand. Say something like Be still in a firm voice; dont raise your voice, as you dont want to scare baby. You might also hug baby close to you to reiterate the point.Try stopping the feeding if baby continues with the acrobatics. Say something like I cant nurse you when youre squirmy. Lets go play and get the wiggles out and we will nurse in a little while. Then play for a few minutes before offering to nurse again.Another version of stopping the feeding: Warn baby that if she doesnt be still, mommys not going to nurse. And then stop the feeding if she persists. Get up, put her down, and explain to her again why you stopped nursing. Tell her that if and when she can be more still, mommy will nurse again.Breastfeeding in public is sometimes a problem when baby is really wiggly. If the acrobatics are too much for breastfeeding in public, try to breastfeed before leaving and tell baby that youll nurse as soon as you get home, to the car, etc. (delaying breastfeeding like this works better when baby is over 18 months and is not overtired). If baby needs something (and will not settle down for nursing) you might offer a snack or a little something from a cup while youre out.See Breastfeeding Manners for additional tips.If I breastfeed past a year, will it be harder to wean?Ive often heard it said that If you dont wean now, youll NEVER be able to! It is not uncommon for moms to wean at a year (or before)  even when neither mom nor baby really want to wean yet  due to the mistaken impression that the only two choices are to wean by a year or keep nursing till age 5!Breastfeeding past a year does NOT make it impossible or even necessarily more difficult to wean later on. If you feel later on that you would like to initiate mother-led weaning, then you can certainly do so. Age has much less to do with ease of weaning than does your childs developmental readiness for weaning. Each child has his own developmental timeline for child-led weaning  the age that a child is ready to self-wean varies greatly from child to child and commonly ranges from age 2 through age 4 (though you certainly see children on either end of this range). When mom initiates weaning, then the closer the child is to weaning on her own, the easier it will be (for both mom and child) to accelerate this natural progression.What is child-led weaning like?Child-led weaning occurs when a child no longer has a need to nurse  nutritionally or emotionally. Its relatively unusual for a baby younger than 18-24 months to self-wean if they are not being encouraged in that direction (though things like moms pregnancy may also affect the timing).A child who is self-weaning will almost always cut down on nursing very gradually over a period of months, one session at a time (anything abrupt is most always a strike). Many children will continue with only a nighttime, morning or naptime nursing session (or a combination) for months before weaning. When a child self-weans, she will also have been drinking well from a cup and getting the vast majority of her nutrition from solid foods for a while.My daughters weaning story is pretty typical  she self-weaned when her little brother was 14 months old. Before he was born, she was nursing mainly at naps, night and wake up, and she continued this after he was born (except for 6-8 weeks of increased nursing right after he was born  typical for tandem nursing). She cut out naps several months before she weaned, so that nursing went by the wayside. About a month before she weaned, she started falling asleep after (or during) bedtime reading with her Dad, so that nursing was cut out. She may have cut down on the wake up nursing session a bit, but it wasnt really noticeable. When we went on vacation with her cousins for a week, she was too busy to nurse in the morning for the last few days. After we got back she nursed maybe twice, about a week apart, and that was the end.Return to Breastfeeding After the First Year for more on toddler nursingHelpful BooksBreastfeeding Past the First Year @ the KellyMom BookstoreFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding and Fertility,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/fertility/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCHow can I use breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy?The transition to full fertilityDo I need to wean to get pregnant?References and Additional ResourcesFertility and conceiving while breastfeedingExclusive breastfeeding/Lactational Amenorrhea Method of birth controlPrint ResourcesHow can I use breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy?The Exclusive Breastfeeding method of birth control is also called the Lactational Amenorrhea Method of birth control, or LAM. Lactational amenorrhea refers to the natural postpartum infertility that occurs when a woman is not menstruating due to breastfeeding. Many mothers receive conflicting information on the subject of breastfeeding and fertility.Myth #1  Breastfeeding cannot be relied upon to prevent pregnancy.Myth #2  Any amount of breastfeeding will prevent pregnancy, regardless of the frequency of breastfeeding or whether moms period has returned.Exclusive breastfeeding has in fact been shown to be an excellent form of birth control, but there are certain criteria that must be met for breastfeeding to be used effectively.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Exclusive breastfeeding (by itself) is 98-99.5% effective in preventing pregnancy as long as all of the following conditions are met:Your baby is less than six months oldYour menstrual periods have not yet returnedBaby is breastfeeding on cue (both day & night), and gets nothing but breastmilk or only token amounts of other foods.Effectiveness of Birth Control MethodsNumber of Pregnancies per 100 WomenMethodPerfect UseTypical UseLAM0.52.0Mirena IUD0.10.1Depo-Provera0.33.0The Pill / POPs0.38.0Male condom2.015.0Diaphragm6.016.0* Adapted from information at plannedparenthood.org.How can I maximize my natural period of infertility?Timing for the return to fertility varies greatly from woman to woman and depends upon babys nursing pattern and how sensitive moms body is to the hormones involved in lactation.Breastfeeding frequency and total amount of time spent breastfeeding per 24 hours are the strongest factors leading to the return of fertility: a mother is more likely to see the return of fertility if babys nursing frequency and/or duration is reduced, particularly if the change is abrupt.In some populations, research has shown that night nursing slows the return to fertility.One study showed that mothers who were separated from their infants (but expressed milk to provide 100% breastmilk for baby) had a higher pregnancy risk (5.2%) during the first 6 months (Valdes 2000).The introduction of solid food can also be a factor in the return of fertility. Once baby starts solids (if moms cycles have not returned), the natural period of infertility may be prolonged by breastfeeding before offering solids, starting solids gradually, and not restricting nursing.You can achieve higher effectiveness by practicing ecological breastfeeding:keeping baby closebreastfeeding on cue (day and night)using breastfeeding to comfort your babybreastfeeding in a lying-down position for naps and at nightusing no bottles or pacifiersIf you practice ecological breastfeeding:Chance of pregnancy is practically zero during the first three months, less than 2% between 3 and 6 months, and about 6% after 6 months (assuming moms menstrual periods have not yet returned).The average time for the return of menstrual periods is 14.6 months.Moms whose cycles return early tend to be infertile for the first few cycles. Moms whose cycles return later are more likely to ovulate before their first period.Source: Natural Child Spacing and Breastfeeding by Jen OQuinnSource: Natural Child Spacing and Breastfeeding by Jen OQuinnWhile it is possible for a nursing mom to become pregnant while she is breastfeeding and before she has her first menstrual period, it is rare. Most moms do not get pregnant until after their first period (often referred to as the warning period). Even after that, while some can become pregnant the first cycle, others will require months of cycles before pregnancy can occur. Still others (this is quite uncommon) may not be able to become pregnant until complete weaning has occurred.The transition to full fertilitySeveral studies have indicated that fertility and ovarian activity return step by step (Ellison 1996, p. 326-327):Follicular activity without ovulation(No chance of pregnancy.)1a. Menstruation without ovulation (This does not always occursee below.)Ovulation without luteal competence (After the egg is released, fertilization may take place. During the luteal phase, the uterine lining is prepared for implantation as the egg travels down the fallopian tube and into the uterus. If the uterine lining is not adequately prepared for implantation, the implantation will probably not be successful.)Full luteal competence (Full fertility  at this point breastfeeding no longer has any effect on your chance of pregnancy.)It is possible to have one or (occasionally) more periods before you start ovulating. In this case, menstruation begins during the first stage of the return to fertility before ovulation returns. Cycles without ovulation are most common during the first six months postpartum. For other mothers, the first menstruation is preceded by ovulation  a longer period of lactational amenorrhea increases the likelihood that you will ovulate before that first period.A very small percentage of women will become pregnant during their first postpartum ovulation, without having had a postpartum period. Per fertility researcher Alan S. McNeilly, this is rare and in our experience is related to a rapid reduction in suckling input.It is not uncommon for breastfeeding mothers to report cyclical cramping or PMS-type symptoms  symptoms of an oncoming period without the period  for weeks or even months before their period returns. When this happens, the body is probably gearing up for the return of menstruation, but breastfeeding is still delaying the return of fertility.The amount of time that it takes for the transition to full fertility varies from woman to woman. In general, the earlier that your menses return, the more gradual the return to full fertility.ReferenceMenstruation without ovulationFirst ovulation without luteal competenceTime between 1st period and ovulation0-6 moafter 6 mo0-6 moafter 6 moEslami 199067%22%8.4 weeks0.1 weekGray 199045.1%the rate fell greatly41%ReferenceFrequency of ovulationLactation:1st cycleLactation:2nd cyclePost-weaning:1st cyclePost-weaning:2nd cycleFormula-feeding only:2nd cycleHowie 198245%66%70%84%94%Do I need to wean to get pregnant?Probably not. If you are still transitioning to full fertility (as discussed above), breastfeeding may affect the success of implantation. Once implantation is successful, breastfeeding should not affect a healthy pregnancy (see A New Look at the Safety of Breastfeeding During Pregnancy for more information). If your periods have come back and settled into a regular pattern, it is likely that breastfeeding is no longer affecting your fertility.Many moms can conceive without deliberately changing their toddlers nursing patterns. There is no magic threshold of breastfeeding that will allow you to conceive  every mother is different. Some moms need to stretch out nursing frequency and/or shorten nursing sessions to make it easier to conceive  babies naturally do this themselves as they get older, so one of your options is simply to wait a bit.Changes that are more abrupt tend to bring fertility back faster (e.g., cutting out one nursing session abruptly, rather than gradually decreasing nursing time at that session) even if you continue to breastfeed a great deal this is why many mothers experience the return of fertility when their child sleeps through the night or starts solid foods. If you decide to make changes to your nursing pattern, the time of day that you make the change (e.g., cutting out or shortening a nighttime nursing session as opposed to a daytime nursing session) should not make that much of a difference. Current research indicates that nursing frequency and total amount of time at the breast per 24 hours are the most important factors, rather than the time of day that the suckling occurs.A few moms do find it impossible to conceive while nursing, but this is not at all common.Many mothers wonder whether breastfeeding will affect the reliability of pregnancy tests. It does not  pregnancy tests measure the amount of the hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in blood or urine, and hCG levels are not affected by breastfeeding. The developing placenta begins releasing hCG upon implantation; a pregnancy can generally be detected with a pregnancy test within 7-14 days after implantation.For more information, see Getting Pregnant While Breastfeeding by Hilary Flower.When you do get pregnant while breastfeeding, what next?

Getting Pregnant While Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/ttc-while-bf/,"PDF version (great for printing)By Hilary Flower, author ofAdventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyond, published by La Leche League InternationalSo youre breastfeeding and dreaming of a new baby? Good news! Lots of moms are able to conceive a new baby without having to wean their current nursling. Lets look at seven of the most common questions. Do I have to wean in order to get pregnant?Probably not. It is true that breastfeeding can delay the return of fertility, especially while frequency and duration of breastfeeding sessions remain high. But most women can become fully fertile while still breastfeeding.1Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. Is there a way to bring my fertility back sooner?Try tinkering with your breastfeeding pattern. Each pair is different. There is no magic or typical threshold of breastfeeding intensity which predicts the return of fertility. Abrupt changes generally bring back fertility more rapidly and at a higher threshold of breastfeeding frequency than gradual changes.1Of course, you and your child would have to be ready for a radical change. And bear in mind, your body may be trying to space your children more so as to prolong the special status your current nursling is enjoying! My menstrual cycle has returned; am I fertile yet?If you are experiencing regular menstrual cycles, and if you were normally fertile before, chances are you have returned to normal fertility. Long, short, or irregular cycles can be a sign that your cycles are not yet fertile. Sometimes its just the way your body works; it helps if you have a record of your cycles from before you were breastfeeding.1 How can I tell if I am fertile?If you wish to know more about your fertility status, you can gain remarkable insights using simple family planning methods. Toni Weschler, MPH, includes a section on charting during breastfeeding in her wonderful guide Taking Charge of Your Fertility. Can I get pregnant before my first period?Yes! Some lucky and patient moms manage to catch the first egg. While you are still amenorrhoeic you can monitor your returning fertility on a family planning chart. Patience is the key, because the amenorrheic period when changes are occurring can involve weeks or months of wet cervical fluid. Weschlers Taking Charge of Your Fertility has great information on this. I have had problems with infertility in the past; should I wean before treatments?If youre eager to become pregnant first steps may include charting some cycles or reducing breastfeeding to evaluate your fertility status. If you are not ready to try to conceive, though, you may do well to take precautions since fertility reversals do occur.Although there is no direct research, there is no obvious reason to believe that fertility treatments would harm the breast milk. To find out the latest on how a particular drug affects breastfeeding, turn to Thomas Hale, MDs Medications and Mothers Milk. Clinical observations suggest that Clomid (Clomiphene) is compatible with breastfeeding.2 And there is no reason to expect that breastfeeding would affect your fertility treatment because the drugs will control your cycle.3 Is it safe to continue breastfeeding while pregnant?Breastfeeding is believed to be compatible with healthy pregnancies. Many moms go on to nurse throughout pregnancy and nurse both newborn and toddler together, an arrangement known as tandem nursing. For the latest in research related to breastfeeding and such concerns as preterm labor, miscarriage, and the nutrition of the unborn child, see my book Adventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyond.REFERENCESMcNeilly, AS, Glasier, AF, Howie PW, Houston MJ, Cook A, Boyle H.

Increasing Low Milk Supply,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/low-supply/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage credit: koadmunkee on flickrIs your milk supply really low?First of all, is your milk supply really low? Often, mothers think that their milk supply is low when it really isnt. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then you do not have a problem with milk supply.Its important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.What if youre not quite sure about babys current weight gain (perhaps baby hasnt had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Dont offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesnt need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.Your baby doesnt nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day  often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the reason.Your baby guzzles down a bottle of formula or expressed milk after nursing. Many babies will willingly take a bottle even after they have a full feeding at the breast. Read more here from board-certified lactation consultant Kathy Kuhn about why baby may do this and how this can affect milk supply. Of course, if you regularly supplement baby after nursing, your milk supply will drop (see below).Your breasts dont leak milk, or only leak a little, or stop leaking. Leaking has nothing to do with your milk supply. It often stops after your milk supply has adjusted to your babys needs.Your breasts suddenly seem softer. Again, this normally happens after your milk supply has adjusted to your babys needs.You never feel a let-down sensation, or it doesnt seem as strong as before. Some women never feel a let-down. This has nothing to do with milk supply.You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time.See also Is my baby getting enough milk?Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Who to contact if you suspect low milk supplyIf youre concerned about your milk supply, it will be very helpful to get in touch with a trained breastfeeding counselor or a board certified lactation consultant. If your baby is not gaining weight or is losing weight, you need to keep in close contact with her doctor, since its possible that a medical condition can cause this. Supplementing may be medically necessary for babies who are losing weight until your milk supply increases. If supplementing is medically necessary, the best thing to supplement your baby with is your own pumped milk.Potential causes of low milk supplyThese things can cause or contribute to a low milk supply:Supplementing. Nursing is a supply & demand process. Milk is produced as your baby nurses, and the amount that she nurses lets your body know how much milk is required. Every bottle (of formula, juice or water) that your baby gets means that your body gets the signal to produce that much less milk.Bottle preference. A bottle requires a different type of sucking than nursing, and it is easier for your baby to extract milk from a bottle. As a result, giving a bottle can either cause your baby to have problems sucking properly at the breast, or can result in baby preferring the constant faster flow of the bottle.Pacifiers. Pacifiers can affect babys latch. They can also significantly reduce the amount of time your baby spends at the breast, which may cause your milk supply to drop.Nipple shields can be a useful tool in some cases, but hey can also reduce the stimulation to your nipple or interfere with milk transfer, which can interfere with the supply-demand cycle.Scheduled feedings interfere with the supply & demand cycle of milk production and can lead to a reduced supply, sometimes several months later rather than immediately. Nurse your baby whenever she is hungry.Sleepy baby. For the first few weeks, some babies are very sleepy and only ask to nurse infrequently and for short periods. Until baby wakes up and begins to breastfeed well, nurse baby at least every two hours during the day and at least every 4 hours at night to establish your milk supply.Cutting short the length of nursings. Stopping a feeding before your baby ends the feeding herself can interfere with the supply-demand cycle. Also, your milk increases in fat content later into a feeding, which helps baby gain weight and last longer between feedings.Offering only one breast per feeding. This is fine if your milk supply is well-established and your baby is gaining weight well. If youre trying to increase your milk supply, let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.Health or anatomical problems with baby (including, jaundice, tongue-tie, etc.)can prevent baby from removing milk adequately from the breast, thus decreasing milk supply.Moms health (uncontrolled anemia or hypothyroidism, retained placenta, postpartum hemorrhage), previous breast surgery/injury, hormonal problems (e.g. PCOS), anatomical problems, medications she is taking (hormonal birth control, sudafed), or smoking also have the potential to affect milk supply.Increasing your milk supplyMilk production is a demand & supply process. If you need to increase milk supply, its important to understand how milk is made  understanding this will help you to do the right things to increase production.To speed milk production and increase overall milk supply, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings.OK, now on to things that can help increase your milk supply:Make sure that baby is nursing efficiently. This is the remove more milk part of increasing milk production. If milk is not effectively removed from the breast, then moms milk supply decreases. If positioning and latch are off then baby is probably not transferring milk efficiently. A sleepy baby, use of nipple shields or various health or anatomical problems in baby can also interfere with babys ability to transfer milk. For a baby who is not nursing efficiently, trying to adequately empty milk from the breast is like trying to empty a swimming pool through a drinking straw  it can take forever. Inefficient milk transfer can lead to baby not getting enough milk or needing to nurse almost constantly to get enough milk. If baby is not transferring milk well, then it is important for mom to express milk after and/or between nursings to maintain milk supply while the breastfeeding problems are being addressed.Nurse frequently, and for as long as your baby is actively nursing. Remember  you want to remove more milk from the breasts and do this frequently. If baby is having weight gain problems, aim to nurse at least every 1.5-2 hours during the day and at least every 3 hours at night.Take a nursing vacation. Take baby to bed with you for 2-3 days, and do nothing but nurse (frequently!) and rest (well, you can eat too!).Offer both sides at each feeding. Let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.Switch nurse. Switch sides 3 or more times during each feeding, every time that baby falls asleep, switches to comfort sucking, or loses interest. Use each side at least twice per feeding. Use breast compression to keep baby feeding longer. For good instructions on how to do this, see Dr. Jack Newmans Protocol to manage breastmilk intake. This can be particularly helpful for sleepy or distractible babies.Avoid pacifiers and bottles when possible. All of babys sucking needs should be met at the breast (see above). If a temporary supplement is medically required, it can be given with a nursing supplementer or by spoon, cup or dropper (see Alternative Feeding Methods).Give baby only breastmilk. Avoid all solids, water, and formula if baby is younger than six months, and consider decreasing solids if baby is older. If you are using more than a few ounces of formula per day, wean from the supplements gradually to challenge your breasts to produce more milk.Take care of mom. Rest. Sleep when baby sleeps. Relax. Drink liquids to thirst (dont force liquids  drinking extra water does not increase supply), and eat a reasonably well-balanced diet.Consider pumping. Adding pumping sessions after or between nursing sessions can be very helpful  pumping is very important when baby is not nursing efficiently or frequently enough, and can speed things up in all situations. Your aim in pumping is to remove more milk from the breasts and/or to increase frequency of breast emptying. When pumping to increase milk supply, to ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. However, adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency but perhaps not removing milk thoroughly) is helpful.Consider a galactagogue. A substance (herb, prescription medication, etc.) that increases milk supply is called a galactagogue. See What is a galactagogue? Do I need one? for more information.Additional information@ How does milk production work?My breasts feel empty!

I’m not pumping enough milk. What can I do?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/pumping_decrease/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage credit: Mrs. Flinger on flickrIntroductionMilk supply normally varies somewhat throughout the day and over weeks and months. As long as baby is allowed to nurse on cue, your milk supply will typicallyaccommodate babys needs. However, when you arepumping part-time or full-time, pumping output can become an issue due to a few factors:The ability to measure how much milk you are pumping makes any decrease in pumping output more obvious and more worrying, even whenits a normal variation.Yougenerally need to pump x amount of milk for baby for a particular day, and it can be quite stressful when you donot pump this amount.No pump can remove milk from the breast as well as an effectively nursing baby, so pumping does not maintain milk supply as well as a nursing baby. Because of this, the greater the percentage of babys nourishment provided by pumping (rather than direct breastfeeding), the greater the possibility that youmay have to work harder to maintain supply.What is normal when it comes to pumping output and changes in pumping output?It is typical for a mother who is breastfeeding full-time to be able to pump around 1/2 to 2 ounces total (for both breasts) per pumping session. Mothers who pump more milk per session may have an oversupply of milk, or may respond better than average to the pump, or may have been able to increase pump output with practice. Many mothers think that they should be able to pump 4-8 ounces per pumping session, but even 4 ounces is a rather large pumping output for a mom who is breastfeeding full-time.It is not unusual to need to pump 2-3 times to get enough milk for one feeding for baby (remember that the pump cannot get as much milk as a baby who nurses effectively).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Many mothers are able to pump more milk per session when they are separated from baby or if they are exclusively pumping. Milk pumped when you are breastfeeding full-time is extra milk  over and beyond what baby needs. Dont get discouraged if you are trying to build up a freezer stash when breastfeeding full time and dont get much milk per pumping session  this is perfectly normal and expected.It is very common to have more milk than baby needs in the early weeks, which regulates down to babys needs over the first few weeks or months. When your milk supply regulates (this change may occur either gradually or rather suddenly), it is normal for pumping output to decrease. For moms who have oversupply, this change often occurs later (6-9+ months postpartum rather than 6-12 weeks).It is normal for pumping output to vary from session to session and day to day. Having an occasional low volume day is not unusual.During a growth spurt, dont be surprised if baby drinks more expressed milk than usual, making it harder for mom to provide enough expressed milk. Growth spurts are temporary  try increasing nursing and adding a pumping session or two until the growth spurt is over.Menstruation or ovulation can result in a temporary drop in milk supply. You might also notice cyclical dips in milk supply before your period returns, as your body begins the return to fertility. Hormonal changes also cause milk supply to decrease during pregnancy.Remember that the amount of milk that you pump is not a measure of themilk supplyavailable to your baby at the breast!What can cause a decrease in pumping output?First, consider the possibility that baby is being overfed by bottle when you and baby are separated. If this is the case, you may actually not need to be expressing as much milk as is being requested. This is certainly not always the case, but it is not at all uncommon. See How much expressed milk will my baby need? for additional information.Image credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrWhen you do need to pump more milk, the first thing to check is your pump:Are you using an appropriate pump for the amount of pumping that you do?How old is your pump? If you have an older electric pump (particularly older than a year), or if you are pumping more often than the pump was designed for, the motor may be wearing out.Many times a decrease in pumping output is because pump parts need to be replaced. Have you checked your pump and replaced any parts that are worn or that havent been replaced in the last 3-6 months?Do you have a type of pump (check your user manual) that benefits from occasionally boiling the boilable parts?Switching to a larger pump flange makes a difference in pumping comfort and/or output for some moms. See Choosing a Correctly-Fitted Breastshield for more information.Supply-demand cycle:Have you reduced the number of pumping or nursing sessions recently, or cut back on nursing/pumping in other ways? Milk production is a demand-supply process. More nursing/pumping results in a greater milk supply. If you consistently decrease nursing or pumping for several days, your overall milk supply will decrease and you can expect to see a decrease in pumped amounts.Has baby started solids recently? As baby eats more solids and takes in less milk, overall milk supply naturally decreases and you may see a decrease in pumping output. You may not notice a change in nursing pattern, as some babies nurse just as often, but take in less milk during those sessions. If baby started solids early (before around 6 months) or is eating lots of solids early on, you are more likely to notice a drop in supply. A very gradual start to solids around 6 months or later is less likely to affect milk supply.Hormonal causes of decreased milk supply:Have you started hormonal birth control recently? Hormonal birth control, particularly that containing estrogen, can significantly decrease milk supply.Are you expecting either ovulation or your period soon, or has it recently started?Are you pregnant?Taking care of mom:Have you started a strict diet? Are you getting enough calories? Snacking during the day on healthy, protein-rich foods may be helpful.Are you drinking to thirst? Some moms, particularly when they are at work, will get busy and forget to drink enough fluids.Are you getting enough rest? This can be hard to do when you have a baby. Try to go to bed a little earlier and to take a nap each day on your days off. Consider co-sleeping so you can get more sleep. Just a little added rest may make a big difference.Have you been under an unusually large amount of stress? Stress can affect let-down and pumping output.Have you been sick? Illness, especially if you have a fever, mastitis or get dehydrated, can result in a temporary decrease in milk supply. Some medications can also decrease milk supply (hormonal birth control, pseudoephedrine, ethanol/alcoholic beverages, bromocriptine, ergotamine, cabergoline).See also Hidden Hindrances to a Healthy Milk SupplyHow can I increase pumping output?To speed milk production and increase overall milk supply, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings.Increasing frequencyNurse more often when you are with your baby.Are you pumping frequently enough? Is there any way you can add a pumping session at work? If necessary, when pumping times are very limited, adding even a short 5 minute pumping session is better than not pumping at all.Add a pumping session or two outside of work hours or on the weekend. Try pumping after baby nurses, or pump one side while baby nurses on the other side. You might also try pumping while baby is napping, at night, or when baby goes longer than usual between nursings.Does your baby complain about slower milk flow when you pump between nursings? If so, try single pumping between nursings, instead of double pumping. Although single pumping is not as effective for increasing milk supply, this leaves one breast more full, so the milk will flow more quickly. See also these tips for babies who want a faster milk flow.Try cluster pumping, instead of a regular nursing/pumping session. Sit down with your baby and your pump, and nurse and pump every half-hour to hour for several hours.Some moms find it helpful to do a 2-3 day long power pump every couple of weeks to super charge their milk supply. This is simply a nursing vacation with pumping added in. On these days, get lots of rest, nurse very frequently and pump after as many nursing sessions as possible.Removing more milk from the breastsAre you pumping long enough? When pumping to increase milk supply, its recommended that you (double) pump for at least 15 minutes; to ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. If you dont always have time to pump this long, remember that adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency but perhaps not removing milk thoroughly) is helpful.Use a good double pump. Double pumping generally results in better pumping output and is better for maintaining milk supply. Pump quality can make a huge difference in pumping output, and different moms have better results with different pumps. However, some moms with abundant milk supplies do not respond well to pumping (even using the best of pumps) and do not get much milk when pumping. These moms may get better results using manual expression.Use breast massage and breast compression.If your pump has a soft shield or shield insert available (for example, the Medela Comfort breastshield or the Ameda Flexishield insert), then try using the pump with and without it. Some moms get better results with the softer shield; some get better results without it.Switching to a larger pump flange increases pumping output for some moms.GalactagoguesMany working and pumping moms have found that eating oatmealand staying hydrated is very helpful for increasing pumping output. It can be helpful to snack on protein-rich foods during the day and to have something to drink every time you sit down to pump or breastfeed.Many moms have gotten good results using fenugreek or other herbs to increase supply, either on a short- or long-term basis. This is most effective when combined with increased nursing/pumping.Other things to tryThe following things are useful for maximizing nursing and minimizing the amount of expressed milk that baby needs while you are away.Nurse right before you leave baby and immediately after you return from work. Make sure your care provider does not feed baby right before you are due to return.Has your baby started solids? If so, have your care provider offer all (or most) solids, and only (or mainly) breastfeed when you are with baby. By doing this, baby may need less milk when you are apart (due to the solids) and will nurse more when you are together. This can both help your supply (more nursing) and decrease the amount of pumped milk you need to provide.Encourage baby to reverse cycle  reverse cycling is when baby nurses frequently when mom and baby are together (usually at night) and takes little milk when mom & baby are separated.One study has shown that the moms of hospitalized babies who listened to guided relaxation or soothing music while pumping had an increased pumping output. When mom listened to a recording that included both music and guided relaxation while pumping, in addition to looking at photos of her baby, pumping output was increased even more. In this study, the interventions led to moms producing 2-3 times their normal pumping output. Milk fat content also increased for these moms in the early days of the study.Additional informationIncreasing Low Milk Supply@KellyMomLet-down Reflex: Too slow?@KellyMomHow Much Milk Should You Expect toPump?byNancy Mohrbacher, IBCLC, FILCAWhat to Expect When Pumping by Paula YountHow much expressed milk will my baby need?@KellyMomTo Pump More Milk, Use Hands-OnPumpingbyNancy Mohrbacher, IBCLC, FILCABreastpumps  troubleshooting and general info@KellyMomOuch!

To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 4-6         tablespoons (60-90 mL) of water into a clean diaper (if baby         wets more often, then the amount of urine per diaper may         be less). Diapers may be wetter in the morning, especially       with older babies. Urine should be pale and mild smelling.DIRTY DIAPERS: Depends on your child.

Can you use the same criteria? At some point,                 many moms will wonder about their milk supply and whether it is                 keeping up with babys growth.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Following are signs that your older baby is getting enough milk.                 (If baby is younger than 6 weeks, then see how                 to tell if your newborn is getting enough milk.) If baby is                 getting enough milk, then you can rest assured that your milk supply                 is just fine.Baby has adequate weight gain. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then baby is getting enough milk and you do not have a problem with milk supply.Baby (older than 6 weeks) should wet at least 4-5 disposable diapers (5-6 cloth diapers) every 24 hours and the diapers should be really wet. At all ages, urine should be pale and mild smelling. As baby grows, so also does his bladder and its ability to hold more urine. For this reason, your baby may not wet as often as he did as a newborn, but typically the diapers will be wetter than when baby was younger. To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 4-6 tablespoons (60-90 mL) of water into a clean diaper (but keep in mind that if baby wets more often, then the amount of urine per diaper will be less). Its also normal for diapers to be wetter in the morning, especially with older babies.     Note: If baby is getting significant liquids in addition to breastmilk (formula, water or juice), then this diaper count will let you know that baby is well-hydrated, but will not be a reliable gauge of whether baby is getting enough breastmilk. Breastmilk should be babys main source of                 nutrition throughout the first year. Baby is stooling within normal parameters (for your baby). Older breastfed babies (after the first 6-8 weeks) can go several days without a stool. Ten days or more is not uncommon! The long periods between stools in a baby who is obviously thriving is not a cause for concern if the babys abdomen remains soft, and the baby is content and alert. As long as the stool is no thicker than toothpaste when passed and profuse if several days have gone by, its still within the norm. Keep in mind that ANY formula or other supplemental foods given to the baby can alter the color, consistency, and frequency of the stool. More at this link on normal stools for breastfed babies. Your breast feels softer after the feeding.Baby seems reasonably content immediately after the feeding.Baby is alert, active and meeting his/her milestones. Many times, the normal changes that occur as breastfeeding                 continues past the first few weeks or months can make mom feel like                 her milk supply is decreasing, even though it isnt.

Take a look at Normal Growth of Breastfed Babies for more on this subject.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Following is a quick sketch of some things to look into when baby is not gaining well. This is by no means complete.Poor breastfeeding management is the most common cause of low weight gain .is baby taking in enough calories?Is baby having enough wet and dirty diapers? This is an indicator of how much milk baby is taking in.What is babys nursing pattern? Is baby nursing frequently enough? Some things on babys side that might interfere with nursing frequency include jaundice, sleepy newborn, distraction and pacifier use.Is mom letting baby determine when to switch sides, or is she switching after a set time?Is baby latching well and transferring milk adequately?Is moms milk supply adequate? (Remember that pumping output is not a useful indicator of milk supply.)It is not necessary to pump and bottle feed or to give formula to determine whether baby is getting enough calories. There is a specialized scale (often available for rent from your lactation consultant or hospital) that can be used for pre- and post-feed weights to determine whether baby is taking in enough milk. There is a special procedure that is used for getting these weights  make sure the person doing the weighing is familiar with it.See Is baby getting enough milk? for more information.Evaluate baby for medical problems that might interfere with weight gain.Babies who are sick (with even a minor illness) often slow weight gain or even lose weight.A few common things that can affect weight gain are ear infection, thrush, reflux, anemia, allergies, tongue-tie, and urinary tract infections.What can I do to increase my babys weight gain?There are several simple things that have been proven to help with weight gain:Stop or decrease solid foods, particularly if baby is younger than 6 months. Most solids foods have fewer calories and nutrients than breastmilk, plus they tend to replace (rather than add to) the higher-calorie, more nutritious breastmilk.Sleep close to your baby (this increases prolactin and frequency of nursing).Learn baby massage  this has been proven to improve digestion and weight gain.Carry baby throughout the day in a baby carrier; get as much skin to skin contact as you can. Both of these things have been shown to improve weight gain.Nurse often  at least every 2 hours during the day and at least once at night. Frequent nursing increases babys milk intake.Make sure youre allowing your baby to completely finish one side before you offer the other by waiting upon her cues that she is finished; i.e. pulling off herself and looking satisfied, going to sleep, changing from an active suck/swallow to more of a pacifier suck, etc. Always OFFER the second side, but dont worry if she doesnt seem to need it. Its much more important that she be allowed to completely finish one side than that she nurse both sides. By doing so she will be assured of reaching enough of the richer, more caloric hindmilk that helps her to go longer between feedings.Use breast massage and breast compression during breastfeeding. If youre pumping, use hands on pumping techniques.Pump or hand express for a couple of minutes before nursing. This will remove some of the foremilk so that your baby receives more of the richer, higher calorie hindmilk.If supplements are medically indicated, breastmilk is preferred over formula as a supplement (exceptions to this are rare), and the average fat/calorie content of moms milk is higher than that of formula. Mom can pump for 5-10 minutes after nursing (dont interrupt or shorten the nursing session to do this), and offer this higher-fat hindmilk to baby as needed. This is also an option for moms who normally offer expressed milk when they are separated from baby.See also What affects the amount of fat or calories in moms milk?Additional information @ What affects the amount of fat or calories in moms milk?Got Milk?

Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/weight-toomuch/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIt is normal for breastfed babies to gain weight more rapidly than their formula-fed peers during the first 2-3 months and then taper off (particularly between 9 and 12 months). There is absolutely NO evidence that a large breastfed baby will become a large child or adult. In fact, there is good research to indicate that breastfed babies are less likely to be obese children or adults than babies who were formula-fed.Babies who gain quickly during infancy often start to slim down once they become more mobile; ie. rolling, crawling, pulling up, walking, running, etc. Often toddlers are very picky eaters and/or become almost too busy to take the time to eat. The fat laid down in infancy ensures that there are ample stores to pull from during the active toddler years.Keep in mind, too, that breastmilk is a perfect food. There are NO empty calories or fillers. The amount of fat or calories in breastmilk is not affected by moms dietary fat or sugar intake. However, mom can change the types of fat in her milk by altering the types of fat that she eats. (See Can you affect the amount of fat or calories in your milk? What we know from research.)Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Do not try to limit your babys nursing by stretching out feedings, limiting time at the breast, using a pacifier to hold baby off until a specified time has passed, or offering water so that baby nurses less. It can be dangerous to limit your babys growth by limiting nursing, as your baby needs the nutrients and fat for proper growth and brain development. Only by continuing to feed your baby on cue will you ensure that his needs are perfectly met and that your milk supply is maintained.A 2002 study (Stettler N, Zemel BS, Kumanyika S, Stallings VA. Infant Weight Gain and Childhood Overweight Status in a Multicenter, Cohort Study. Pediatrics 2002; 109: 194-199) received a lot of press coverage and worried some parents. The researchers concluded, A pattern of rapid weight gain during the first 4 months of life was associated with an increased risk of overweight status at age 7 years, independent of birth weight and weight attained at age 1 year. However, the study data included practically no information on how the infants were fed (including the length/exclusivity of breastfeeding and when solids were introduced). The study looked at data for over 19,000 children who were born between 1959 and 1965 in 12 U.S. cities. These children were born at around the height of formula feeding in the US, and also at a time when very early introduction of solids was recommended. Both formula feeding and early intro of solids have been shown to increase the chance of childhood obesity. Per La Leche League, Dr. Nicholas Stettler (who headed up this study) said that there is an easy way to prevent this obesity; simply follow the American Academy of Pediatrics guideline  breastfeed the infant exclusively for six months, followed by the slow introduction of solids and continued breastfeeding to one year or beyond.What can cause faster weight gain than the norm in an exclusively breastfed baby?Genetics. Did your older children gain quickly as infants? What about Mom & Dad  are you large in size, or were you large as babies? What about other family members?Overabundant supply can result in more rapid than normal weight gain (over an ounce per day). However, oversupply is not a concern unless it is causing problems for mom or baby.Rarely, too-rapid weight gain can be related to health problems, such as congestive heart failure, renal anomalies, and/or endocrine disorders. If baby has health problems, continued breastfeeding is even more important.How I can help to prevent my child from becoming overweight?The BEST thing you can do to lessen the chance that your baby will become overweight as a child or as an adult is to breastfeed as long as possible.Avoid solids for at least 6 months (this is especially helpful for babies who come from a family with a history of obesity or allergies).Once you start solid foods, add them slowly to babys diet. Nurse before offering solids, and make sure that the majority of babys calories come from breastmilk through the end of the first year.Allow your child to eat to appetite  dont push your child to continue eating when he is not hungry.Once your baby becomes more active, allow him plenty of time to play and move around.As your child becomes older, set a good example with healthy eating habits and exercise.Additional InformationIs your baby nursing all the time?

"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: How to Calm, Connect, and Communicate with Your Baby",http://kellymom.com/parenting/reviews/review_babywhisperer/,"by   Tracy Hogg, with Melinda Blau        Ballantine Books, New York        ISBN: 0345440757      reviewed   by Mary TatkoThe first time I read Dr.                 William Sears warning against baby trainers, I couldnt help                 picturing a man in a top hat sending beleaguered babies through                 a series of hoops. Now I can replace that image with the smiling                 face of Baby Whisperer Tracy Hogg, the apparent ringmaster in                 todays world of baby trainers. In Secrets Of The Baby Whisperer: How To Calm, Connect, And                 Communicate With Your Baby, Hogg and co-author Melinda Blau                 promise to help new parents maintain balance by preventing a newborn                 from dominating their lives. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Sorting fact from opinion from flat-out fiction in this books                 nearly 300 pages is something no new parent should have to do. But                 parenting advice sells, a fact attested to by the books New York                 Times bestseller status, so you can bet plenty of moms and dads                 are trying out Hoggs suggestions. Of course not all her advice contradicts the basics of attachment                 parenting (which itself is a parenting style that varies from family                 to family). And I share her fondness for such things as cloth diapers                 and infant massage. But so much of what Hogg serves up as wholesome,                 commonsense guidance for mums and dads (she hails from the U.K.                 and likes to play up her Englishness) is so obviously counter                 to natural parenting, and breastfeeding in particular, that this                 book should come with a warning label. The backbone of Hoggs parenting system, a structured routine                 she calls E.A.S.Y., has four components: the amount of time she                 prescribes for eating (25 to 40 minutes every 2  to 3 hours), activity (45 minutes),                 sleeping (one half to one hour), and you (an hour or more for mom                 while the baby sleeps). While she acknowledges that the exact amount                 of time will vary from baby to baby and with the babys age, she                 makes it clear that following a schedule such as the one she outlines                 is crucial to preventing chaos in the house. When she lays out the case for her E.A.S.Y. parenting routine,                 Hogg takes a couple of paragraphs to dismiss rigid schedules and                 on-demand feeding, setting herself up as a champion of the reasonable                 middle ground between these two extremes. When Hogg states that feeding                 on demand simply makes babies demanding and that parents who                 do so will be giving up their own lives, anyone who knows what                 attachment parenting is and is not probably will put the book                 down. Those who keep reading should, as Hogg herself recommends more                 than once about other peoples advice, take what they read with                 a grain of salt. On the issue of breastfeeding, Hogg again plants herself on self-proclaimed                 middle ground. She laments the controversy over feeding choices                 and sympathizes with new moms who must wade through huge propaganda                 campaigns. (I would think her attempt to equate the efforts of                 volunteer organizations such as La Leche League with the money-driven                 marketing of formula companies must be insulting to many readers,                 regardless of their feeding choices.) Even as Hogg congratulates herself on her even-handedness, she                 manages to vastly understate the benefits of breastfeeding while                 giving considerable ink to the merits of formula, which, she informs                 us, is more refined and chock-full of nutrients than ever. The section of her book titled Making the Choice reads more like                 a defense of formula than an objective overview of feeding choices.                 Among other things, she poo-poos bonding as a reason to breastfeed,                 complains that the health benefits of breast milk have been overblown,                 warns that nursing mothers must carry an extra five to 10 pounds                 to ensure proper nutrition for their babies, makes a point of emphasizing                 that studies merely suggest  not prove  that breastfeeding might                 offer women protection from a variety of health problems, and maintains                 that women concerned about body image might be better off using                 formula since breastfeeding can leave them flat as pancakes or                 sagging. Hogg seems so eager to make up for the breastfeeding advocates                 who are, she implies, out to make mothers who choose formula feel guilty,                 that she cant seem to discuss breast milk without plugging formula                 in the same breath: The proverbial bottom line is that while it is good for a baby to have some breast milk, especially during the first month, if thats not the mothers choice or if for some reason the mother cant breastfeed, formula-feeding is a perfectly acceptable alternative  for some, the preferable alternative.When it comes to the practical how-tos of breastfeeding, Hogg                 provides nuggets of accurate information, but she offers up numerous                 duds as well, including such incorrect or incomplete information                 as: After breastfeeding, always wipe off your nipples with a clean washcloth. The residue of milk can be a breeding ground for bacteria . (Just not true; there is no need to wipe your nipples after every feeding.). always wait one hour (after exercising) before breastfeeding. (The lactic acid buildup shes warning about has not been shown to cause harm, and though some babies seem to dislike the taste of mothers milk after heavy exercise, many babies show no aversion whatsoever.)And for a mother worried she isnt producing enough milk: Once a day, fifteen minutes before a feed, pump your breasts and measure what you are yielding. Taking into account that a baby can extract at least one ounce more by physically sucking at your breast, you have a good idea of what youre producing. (While this test might work well for some mothers, it can be misleading for others. Many mothers find that, though they get very little milk when they pump, their babies are getting plenty at the breast. Weight gain and the number of wet diapers a baby produces are better measures of milk production.)Another low point in the book is Hoggs take on nursing toddlers:                 My feeling is that when mothers prolong nursing, its almost always                 for them, not for the baby. She follows this statement with                 an anecdote about a mother who was (gasp!) still nursing her two-and-a-half-year-old.                 Because her husband was not supportive, she was doing so behind                 his back  obviously not a good situation. To make a long story                 short, the mother came to her senses, weaned the baby, and was                 automatically a better parent, a better wife, and a stronger human                 being. The strangest line of thinking comes in a sidebar titled Feeding                 Fashions in which Hogg points out that, though breastfeeding is                 all the rage today, in the postwar decades . the majority believed                 that formula was best for babies. She fails to mention the reasons                 for formulas rise, the consequences of the trend, or that the world                 health community now is in near-unanimous agreement that breast                 milk is best. Instead she shares this bizarre thought: As this book is being written, scientists are experimenting with the notion of genetically altering cows to produce human breast milk. If that happens, perhaps in the future everyone will tout cows milk.Hogg goes on to quote a 1999 article from the Journal of Nutrition that suggests formulas may one day be so advanced they will meet                 babies needs better than human milk. Im not sure where to file that last bit of information, but there                 is at least one thing this book makes clear: If youre looking for                 a baby trainer, you can skip the circus and turn instead to Tracy                 Hogg. If its accurate parenting information you seek, look elsewhere.  Mary Tatko                 is the stay-at-home-mom of 19-month-old Jake. Mary comments:As you can see, I mainly focused on the chapter about feeding choices, though there was plenty I could take issue with in her chapter on sleep. As you might imagine, Hogg is not a fan of shared sleep. She sets up her recommendations about sleep in the same way she takes on other issues: She dismisses those whose views are extreme, then presents what she claims is a middle-of-the-road, commonsense approach. When shes getting ready to pitch her system for sensible sleep, she cites Dr. Sears, La Leche League, and Mothering magazine as the extremes on the family bed side of the issue. (Dr. Ferber is her example of the other side.) And while she encourages those for whom such practices work to by all means stick with it, she warns that extreme practices dont work for many people.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
The “What to Expect” Series,http://kellymom.com/parenting/reviews/review_whattoexpect/,"The   What to Expect Series        by Arlene Eisenberg, et al comments   by Kelly BonyataThe What to Expect Series includes the                 books What to Expect When Youre Expecting, What to Expect                 the First Year and What to Expect the Toddler Years (plus                 some related books like What to Eat When Youre Expecting,                 and so on). Update: Ive just looked through some of the breastfeeding information in the Third Edition (2002) of What to Expect the First Year. All in all, the general breastfeeding information is significantly better than in the first edition, but quite a number of inaccuracies and misinformation remain scattered throughout. The authors seem to have pushed their comfort level for breastfeeding up to around a year, but they continue to perpetuate myths such as breastfeeding being exhausting for mom, particularly when it comes to breastfeeding past a year. In addition, the moms whom I have worked with continue to mention that they go to the book with a question and come away feeling worried, inadequate and guilty. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The book What to Expect the Toddler Years (which has not been updated since the first edition) is very negative when it comes to breastfeeding a toddler, with many comments similar to the ones quoted below from the First Edition of What to Expect the First Year.The first editions of the books (Ive read through                 the pregnancy, first year and toddler books), give lip service to                 breastfeeding in the early months (though much of the info is quite                 outdated), but gets less and less supportive of breastfeeding as                 babies pass 6 months. Weaning is suggested well before 12 months.                 The authors also advocate letting baby cry (to do otherwise is cowardly)                 and are very much against co-sleeping. Here is a quote from What                 to Expect the First Year (first edition):By the end of the first year, however, scientists tell us that breast milk ceases to be adequatenot only is its protein content is insufficient for the older baby, but it suffers from a decline in several vital nutrients including zinc, copper, and potassium. In the second year, infants require the nutrients in cows milk, and the mother who is still breastfeeding should recognize that although both she and her baby may still be enjoying the experience, breast milk cant be considered a major source of nutrition for her baby. Nor do babies past a year appear to need the sucking breast feeding provides. In spite of much speculation, theres no solid evidence that nursing past the first yearor even well into the second or third or beyondhinders a childs emotional development. But it does seem that prolonged breastfeeding, like prolonged bottlefeeding, can lead to dental decay.These statements are so full of misinformation, its hard to know                 where to start! See Extended                 Breastfeeding Fact Sheet for referenced infomation on the nutritional                 and many other benefits of breastfeeding during the second year                 and beyond Cows                 milk is certainly not needed for anyone but baby cows                 Some babies have breastmilk as their main source of nutrition well                 into the second year There are many studies that show that                 the sucking need (as exhibited through continued pacifier, finger                 or thumb sucking) persists for several years in many children, with                 most stopping by age 4-5 There is good evidence that nursing                 into the second and third year (and beyond) has psychological benefits                 There is no evidence that there is a link                 between extended nursing and dental decay FacebookPinterestTwitter"

AAARRRGGGGHHHH! Talk about a world apart developmentally. And I                 still dont like the idea at 18 months.

Beneficios de la lactancia prolongada,http://kellymom.com/translatation/spanish/ebf-benefits-spanish/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC   Traduccin: Andrea Biestro(Informacin  publicada en ingls en Extended Breastfeeding   Fact Sheet,         traducida  con autorizacin de Kelly Bonyata)El trmino lactancia prolongada se utiliza  cuando el   nio amamantado es mayor de 12 meses de edad. En este artculo, a    dichos nios les llamamos pequeos lactantes.Los pequeos lactantes se benefician NUTRICIONALMENTE:An mucho despus del primer ao  de vida, la leche   materna contina proporcionando cantidades sustanciales de  nutrientes   clave, especialmente protenas, grasas, y la mayor parte de las    vitaminas.Dewey, 2001En el segundo ao de vida (12 a 23  meses), 448 ml de leche materna proporcionan:29% de requerimientos de energa43% de requerimientos de protena36% de requerimientos de calcio75% de requerimientos de vitamina  A76% de requerimientos de cido  flico 94% de requerimientos de vitamina  B12 60% de requerimientos de vitamina  CDewey, 2001Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.El promedio estimado de tomas de  leche en un periodo   de 24 horas fue de 548g para el 97% de nios que fueron  amamantados de   12 a 23 meses de edad, y 312 g para el 73% de nios amamantados  de 24 a   36 meses de edad. Esto representa un promedio diario de ingestin de    41% y 23% de la ingesta diaria recomendada de vitamina A,   respectivamente.Persson 1998A pesar de que  se ha investigado poco sobre nios que   son amamantados despus de los dos aos  de edad, la informacin   disponible indica que la leche materna contina siendo  una fuente   valiosa de nutricin y proteccin contra enfermedades durante todo  el   periodo de lactancia.Es comn que se recomiende el  destete para nios pequeos que ya comen algunos slidos. Sin embargo, esta  recomendacin no est sustentada en  investigacin alguna. De acuerdo con Sally Kneidel en Nursing Beyond One Year  (New Beginnings, Vol. 6 No. 4,  July-August 1990, pp. 99-103.): Algunos mdicos pueden sentir que la lactancia   interferir con el  apetito del nio hacia otras comidas. No obstante,   no hay documentacin que  indique que los alimentos suplementarios son   rechazados ms frecuentemente por  los nios amamantados que por los ya   destetados. De hecho, la gran parte de los  investigadores en pases del   Tercer Mundo, donde el apetito de un nio pequeo  desnutrido puede ser   de importancia crtica, recomiendan la lactancia  prolongada an para   los casos ms severos de desnutricin. (Briend et al, 1988;   Rhode,  1988; Shattock and Stephens, 1975; Whitehead, 1985). La mayora   sugieren ayudar  al nio amamantado no con el destete, sino   suplementando la dieta de la madre  para mejorar la calidad nutricional   de su leche (Ahn and MacLean, 1980;  Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1978), y   ofreciendo al nio comidas ms variadas y  agradables al paladar para   mejorar su apetito (Rohde, 1988; Tangermann, 1988;  Underwood, 1985). (Ver  Referencias 1)Los pequeos lactantes se ENFERMAN MENOS:Anticuerpos son abundantes en la  leche humana durante toda la lactancia (Nutrition  During Lactation 1991; p. 134). De hecho, algunos de los factores  inmunolgicos en la   leche materna aumentan en concentracin durante el segundo  ao y   tambin durante el proceso de destete. (Goldman 1983, Goldman &    Goldblum 1983, Institute of Medicine 1991). Segn la Organizacin Mundial de  la Salud   (www.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact178.html) un aumento moderado en las tasas    de lactancia materna podra prevenir hasta un 10% de las muertes de   nios  menores de 5 aos: El amamantar tiene un papel esencial, y a   veces subestimado,  en el tratamiento y prevencin de enfermedades   infantiles.Se ha encontrado que los nios que  an son   amamantados entre las edades de 16 y 30 meses, tienen menos    enfermedades, y de ms corta duracin, que los que no son amamantados   (Gulick  1986). La Academia Americana de Mdicos  de la Familia indica   que los nios destetados antes de los dos aos de edad  tienen mayor   riesgo de enfermarse (AAFP 2001). (Ver  Referencias 2)Los pequeos lactantes tienen MENOS ALERGIAS:Muchos estudios han mostrado que  una de las mejores   maneras de prevenir alergias y asma es el amamantar de forma  exclusiva   durante al menos seis meses y continuar amamantando a largo plazo. La    leche materna puede ayudar a prevenir alergias al (1) reducir exposicin   a  posibles alergenos (entre ms tarde sea expuesto el beb a ellos, es   menos  probable que se presente una reaccin alrgica), (2) acelerar la   maduracin de  la barrera intestinal protectora del beb, (3) recubrir   el intestino y  proporcionar una barrera contra potenciales molculas   alergnicas, (4)  proporcionar propiedades anti-inflamatorias que   reducen el riesgo de  infecciones (las cuales pueden actuar como   disparadores de alergias).(Ver  Referencias 3)Los pequeos lactantes son INTELIGENTES:Extensas investigaciones sobre la  relacin entre la   lactancia materna y los logros cognoscitivos (nivel de  coeficiente   intelectual, calificaciones escolares), han mostrado las mayores    ganancias en los nios que durante ms tiempo fueron amamantados. (Ver  Referencias 4)Los pequeos lactantes son SOCIALMENTE BIEN ADAPTADOS:De acuerdo con Sally Kneidel en  Nursing Beyond One Year (New  Beginnings, Vol. 6 No. 4, July-August 1990, pp. 99-103):Reportes de investigaciones sobre los  aspectos   psicolgicos de la lactancia son muy escasos. Un estudio que lidiaba    especficamente con bebs amamantados durante ms de un ao mostr un   vnculo  significativo entre la duracin de la lactancia y las   calificaciones dadas  por las madres y los maestros de nios de seis a   ocho aos de edad (Ferguson et  al, 1987). En las palabras de los   investigadores, Hay tendencias  estadsticamente significativas que   demuestran la disminucin en las  puntuaciones de desrdenes de conducta   cuando la duracin de la lactancia se  prolonga.El amamantar durante y despus de  la infancia ayuda a   los bebs y a los nios pequeos a hacer una transicin  gradual hacia   la niez plena. La lactancia materna es una manera clida y  amorosa de   cubrir las necesidades de los nios pequeos. Les ayuda a calmar las    frustraciones, golpes y heridas, y el estrs diario de la niez   temprana. El cubrir las necesidades de  dependencia de un nio,   de acuerdo con su horario personal y nico, es la clave  para ayudar a   ese nio a alcanzar su independencia. Los nios que logran    independencia a su propio ritmo, son ms seguros en dicha independencia   que los  nios que fueron forzados a independizarse prematuramente.(Ver  Referencias 5)Los pequeos lactantes son NORMALES:La Academia Americana de Pediatra  recomienda que los   nios sean amamantados al menos durante 12 meses, y despus  de eso,   durante todo el tiempo que tanto la madre como el hijo deseen hacerlo    (AAP 1997).La Academia Americana de Mdicos  de la Familia   recomienda que la lactancia materna contine durante todo el  primer ao   de vida y que El amamantar despus del ao de vida ofrece  beneficios   considerables tanto a la madre como al nio, y debe continuar  mientras   as lo deseen ambos. Tambin hacen notar que Si el nio es menor de    dos aos de edad, est expuesto a un mayor riesgo de contraer   enfermedades si  es destetado (AAFP 2001).Un Secretario de Salud de Estados  Unidos ha declarado   que es un beb afortunado el que contina amamantando hasta  los dos   aos de edad. (Novello 1990) La Organizacin Mundial de la  Salud pone nfasis en   la importancia de amamantar hasta los dos aos de vida y  ms (WHO 1992,   WHO 2002). Investigaciones cientficas hechas  por un profesor de   Texas A&M, muestran que nuestros hijos estn diseados  para   esperar ser amamantados entre 2.5 y 7 aos (Dettwyler 1995). (Ver Referencias  6)Las MAMS que amamantan a sus hijos de manera prolongada tambin obtienen beneficios:En muchas mujeres, la lactancia  prolongada retrasa el regreso de la fertilidad al suprimir la ovulacin. (Ver Referencias 7)El amamantar reduce el riesgo de  cncer de ovarios. (Ver Referencias 8)El amamantar reduce el riesgo de  cncer uterino. (Ver Referencias 9)El amamantar reduce el riesgo de  cncer del endometrio. (Ver Referencias 10)El amamantar protege contra la  osteoporeosis (Ver Referencias 11). Durante   la lactancia, la madre puede experimentar reducciones de  mineral seo.   La densidad de mineral seo de una madre que amamanta puede ser    reducida en todo el cuerpo en un 1  2 por ciento mientras dure la   lactancia.  Esta prdida regresa a sus niveles originales, y an puede   aumentar, cuando el  beb es destetado. Esto no depende de suplementos   adicionales de calcio en la  dieta de la madre. El amamantar reduce el riesgo de  cncer del seno (Ver Referencias 12). Varios estudios han  encontrado una asociacin inversa significativa entre la duracin de la  lactancia y el riesgo de cncer. Se ha comprobado que el amamantar  disminuye los requerimientos de insulina en mujeres diabticas. (Ver Referencias 13)Las mujeres que amamantan tienden  a perder peso ms fcilmente.

Homepage der AFS: www.afs-stillen.deBei den meisten Informationen, die man zur Ernhrung von Kleinkindern                 findet, wird davon ausgegangen, dass das Kind nicht mehr gestillt                 wird und hauptschlich feste Nahrung zu sich nimmt. Daher haben                 viele Mtter gestillter Kleinkinder (vor allem derjenigen,                 die noch nicht viel feste Nahrung essen) eine Menge Fragen dazu,                 wie sie diese Ratschlge dem Bedarf ihres Kindes anpassen sollen.

Nach dem ersten Geburtstag knnen Sie feste Nahrung vor                 dem Stillen anbieten, statt dessen oder danach. Ihre Milch ist noch                 immer ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Ernhrung Ihres Babys und kommt                 ihm in vielerlei Hinsicht zugute (ernhrungsphysiologisch, immunologisch                 und emotional). Es gibt keine empfohlene Anzahl tglicher Stillmahlzeiten                 fr ein Kleinkind. Manche Kleinkinder stillen nur ein- oder zweimal                 am Tag, whrend andere immer noch gerne sehr viel Zeit an der Brust                 verbringen. Wenn Ihr Baby allmhlich mehr feste Nahrung zu sich                 nimmt, gleicht Ihre Milch mgliche Ernhrungslcken ideal aus. Sobald                 Sie seltener stillen, sollten Sie verstrkt darauf achten, dass                 Ihr Kind mehrere nahrhafte Mahlzeiten am Tag zu sich nimmt.  Kuhmilch?Vielen stillenden Mttern wird gesagt, sie mssten Kuhmilch einfhren,                 wenn ihr Kind ein Jahr alt sei. Ihr gestilltes Kleinkind bekommt                 bereits die beste Milch, die es bekommen kann  Muttermilch! Muttermilch                 hat einen hheren Fettgehalt als Kuhmilch (wichtig fr das Gehirnwachstum                 des Babys), und die Bioverfgbarkeit ist bei allen in der Muttermilch                 enthaltenen Nhrstoffen bedeutend hher als in Kuhmilch, weil Milch                 artspezifisch ist (ganz zu schweigen von all den Bestandteilen der                 Muttermilch, die in Kuhmilch gar nicht enthalten sind). Es besteht keine Notwendigkeit fr Kuhmilch oder Ersatzprodukte                 (wie Ziegenmilch, Sojamilch usw.), solange Ihr Baby zwei- bis dreimal                 tglich gestillt wird. Kuhmilch ist einfach nur eine praktische Quelle von Calcium, Eiwei, Fett, Vitamin D etc.  notwendig ist                 sie nicht. Es gibt viele Menschen in vielen Teilen der Welt, die                 keine Milch trinken und dennoch genug Calcium, Eiwei, Fett, Vitamin                 D usw. zu sich nehmen. Gute Eiweilieferanten sind Fleisch, Fisch, Hlsenfrchte (Erbsen, Bohnen, Kichererbsen, Linsen usw.), Tofu und andere Sojaprodukte, gekochte Eier, Nsse, Erdnussbutter (wenn Ihr Kind nicht allergisch veranlagt ist).Gute Fettlieferanten sind Soja- und Distell, Leinsamen und Leinsamenl, Walnsse, Fisch und Fischl, Avocado. Beim Kochen oder Backen kann man oft l verwenden, beispielsweise in Distell dnsten oder Mini-Muffins mit Soja- oder Reismilch, l oder Butter und Eiern zubereiten.Nicht nur Milchprodukte, sondern auch viele andere Lebensmittel enthalten reichlich Calcium: Dunkelgrne Gemsesorten wie Brokkoli und Spinat, Petersilie, Tofu und andere Sojaprodukte, Hlsenfrchte, Nsse und Samen (Sesam, Sonnenblumenkerne, Mandeln, Haselnsse, Cashews, Walnsse), Algen, Getreide (Tapioka, Quinoa).Wenn Ihr Kind nicht mehr regelmig stillt und nicht allergisch auf Kuhmilchprodukte reagiert, sondern einfach nur keine Kuhmilch mag, knnen Sie anderweitig Milchprodukte in seine Ernhrung einbauen. Viele Kinder mgen Kse, Vollmilchjoghurt oder Eis. Sie knnen auch Milch bei der Zubereitung verschiedener Gerichte verwenden: Pfannkuchen, Waffeln, Muffins, Rhreier, Kartoffelpree und Backwaren.Manche Mtter mchten ihrem Kleinkind Kuhmilch anbieten, aber das Kind mag sie nicht. Nach dem ersten Lebensjahr ist Milch fr die Ernhrung eines Kindes nicht mehr so wichtig. Manchmal hilft es, wenn man immer grere Mengen Kuhmilch mit Ihrer ausgedrckten Muttermilch vermischt, damit sich das Kind an den Geschmack gewhnt. Viele Ernhrungsexperten halten es fr unbedenklich, der Kuhmilch Geschmacksstoffe (z.B. Erdbeer oder Schokolade) beizumischen.Kinderrzte empfehlen inzwischen, dass man, wenn man Kuhmilch anbietet,                 seinem Kind vom ersten bis mindestens zum zweiten Geburtstag nur                 Vollmilch aus einem Becher gibt. Dadurch erhlt Ihr Kind genug Fett,                 was wichtig fr eine gute Gehirnentwicklung ist. Nach dem zweiten                 Geburtstag kann man, wenn das Kind gut wchst, zu fettarmer oder                 fettfreier Milch bergehen. Die Menge an Kuhmilch, die Ihr Kind                 trinkt, sollten Sie auf 500 bis 700 ml tglich beschrnken, da zuviel                 Kuhmilch zu einer Eisenmangelanmie fhren kann (da Milch die Aufnahme                 von Eisen behindern kann) und den Appetit des Kindes auf andere                 Lebensmittel bremsen kann.  Wieviel   sollte mein Kleinkind essen?Zwischen dem ersten und dem fnften Geburtstag befindet sich das                 Kind in einem Zustand verlangsamten Wachstums. Dadurch nimmt auch                 der Kalorienbedarf ab, so dass die Menge der tglich aufgenommenen                 Nahrung geringer ist. Zu dem verlangsamten Wachstum kommt ein steigendes                 Bedrfnis nach Unabhngigkeit, welches die Bandbreite an Lebensmitteln,                 die ihr Kind essen will, einschrnkt (whlerischer Esser). Seien                 Sie beruhigt  aufgrund dieser Verlangsamung des Wachstums brauchen                 Kleinkinder nicht soviel Nahrung, wie Sie vielleicht denken. Drei                 kleine Mahlzeiten und zwei Imbisse pro Tag (und manche essen deutlich                 weniger) spenden wahrscheinlich selbst dem aktivsten Kleinkind genug                 Energie. Bitte seien Sie sich auch darber im Klaren, dass whlerische                 Esser eher die Regel als die Ausnahme sind. Manche Kleinkinder nehmen mit zwlf Monaten nur sehr wenig oder                 noch gar keine feste Nahrung zu sich. Das ist nicht ungewhnlich                 und von Kind zu Kind verschieden  in dem Punkt gibt es groe Unterschiede.                 Whrend der ersten zwlf Monate sollte Muttermilch den Groteil                 (ber 50 Prozent) der Ernhrung eines Babys ausmachen. Mit zwlf                 Monaten nehmen manche Babys schon eine Menge fester Nahrung zu sich,                 whrend andere noch voll oder fast voll gestillt werden. Fr manche                 Babys bleibt Muttermilch der Hauptbestandteil ihrer Ernhrung, bis                 sie achtzehn Monate oder sogar noch lter sind.  Bei manchen Babys dauert es etwas lnger, bis sie anfangen, feste                 Nahrung in greren Mengen zu sich zu nehmen. Manche von reagieren                 empfindlich auf einige Nahrungsmittel, und auf diese Weise schtzt                 ihr Krper sie vielleicht, bis ihr Verdauungssystem mit mehr zurechtkommt.                 Andere bekommen erst spt Zhne oder haben sehr mit Zahnungsschmerzen                 zu kmpfen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt enthlt Ihre Milch alles,                 was ihr Kind braucht, mglicherweise mit der Ausnahme von gengend                 Eisen. Solange sich seine Eisenwerte in einem akzeptablen Rahmen                 bewegen und Sie ihm, wenn es etwas isst, Lebensmittel anbieten,                 die von Natur aus viel Eisen enthalten, haben Sie noch viel Zeit,                 bis Sie sich wegen der Menge fester Nahrung, die es zu sich nimmt,                 Sorgen zu machen brauchen. Alles, was Sie tun mssen, ist, immer wieder Nahrung anzubieten.                 Machen Sie sich keine Sorgen, wenn Ihr Kind kein Interesse zeigt                 oder nur winzige Mengen isst. Ihre einzige wahre Verantwortung besteht                 darin, was Sie anbieten, wann Sie es anbieten und wie Sie es anbieten  nicht, ob Ihr Kind es isst oder nicht.                 Das muss ihm selbst berlassen sein. Der Versuch, Ihr Kind zum Essen                 zu zwingen oder zu berreden, ist nie empfehlenswert. Stillen Sie                 weiterhin nach Bedarf, tagsber und nachts, und vertrauen Sie darauf,                 dass Ihr Kind mehr feste Nahrung zu sich nehmen wird, wenn es bereit                 dazu ist. Wenn das Baby allmhlich mehr feste Nahrung isst, wird                 Ihre Milch mgliche Ernhrungslcken gut ausgleichen.Durchschnittliches   Wachstum von KleinkindernEin paar Dinge, an denen man erkennen kann, ob Ihr Kind gut ernhrt                 ist: Wachstum: nicht notwendigerweise auf einer Kurve, aber Ihr Kind sollte an Lnge und Gewicht zunehmenwichtige Entwicklungsschritte werden ungefhr altersgerecht erreichtAktivittsniveau: munter, frhlich, aktivIch fand es immer schwierig, Informationen ber das durchschnittliche                 Wachstum von Kleinkindern zu finden, also habe ich mir die Wachstumstabellen                 der Centers for Disease Control and Prevention angesehen. (Anmerkung:                 Diese Zahlen sind nicht speziell fr Stillkinder; sie sind den Wachstumstabellen                 fr alle Kinder entnommen.)

CDC   growth charts: USA, 30. Mai 2000.Essvorschlge   fr KleinkinderLebensmittel, die man aus der Hand essen kann, sind sehr geeignet                 fr Kleinkinder. Ihr Kind wird jedoch auch allmhlich lernen, mit                 einem Lffel und einer Gabel selbst zu essen. Viele Babys essen                 lieber Dinge, die sie selbst aufspieen oder in die Hand nehmen                 knnen, als Lebensmittel, die man ihnen mit dem Lffel geben muss.                 Eine Menge Babys zieht Essen vom Familientisch den fad schmeckenden                 Baby-Lebensmitteln vor. Nach dem ersten Geburtstag knnen Sie Ihrem Kind Lebensmittel anbieten,                 die Sie ihm bisher lieber nicht gegeben haben (Kuhmilch, Zitrusfrchte,                 Eiklar), allerdings sollten Sie weiterhin auf eventuelle allergische                 Reaktionen achten. Auch wenn Sie inzwischen mehr Nahrungsmittel                 anbieten knnen, ist die Gefahr des Verschluckens noch immer gegeben.                 Lassen Sie Ihr Kleinkind daher nicht unbeaufsichtigt essen und vermeiden                 Sie weiterhin Lebensmittel wie Popcorn, harte Bonbons, Hot Dogs,                 Weingummi, Mhrenstckchen, Trauben, Rosinen und Nsse. Schneiden                 Sie solche Lebensmittel durch oder hacken Sie sie, oder warten Sie                 einfach, bis Ihr Baby lter wird. Sie sollten Ihrem Kleinkind eine Vielzahl von Lebensmitteln anbieten.                 Es kann die gleichen Dinge essen wie der Rest der Familie. Nahrungsmittel,                 die reich an Eiwei, Calcium und Eisen sind, sowie Obst und Gemse,                 Brot usw. sollten tglich angeboten werden. Servieren Sie so gesunde                 Lebensmittel wie mglich, doch erwarten Sie von Ihrem Kleinkind                 nicht, bei jeder Mahlzeit viel zu essen. Wenn man Kindern nahrhafte                 Mahlzeiten und Imbisse anbietet und sie davon essen lsst, was sie                 wollen, ernhren sich die meisten vollwertig, wenn man ihr Essverhalten                 ber mehrere Tage oder sogar eine Woche bercksichtigt. Ihr Kind                 sollte sich nicht an Snacks satt essen, die nur leere Kalorien enthalten,                 aber Sie sollten es auch nicht zum Essen zwingen. Viele Kleinkinder essen besser, wenn ihnen den ganzen Tag ber                 etwas zu essen zur Verfgung steht und nicht nur zu ein paar festgelegten                 Zeiten. Bieten Sie ihrem Kleinkind einfach den ganzen Tag ber nhrstoffreiche                 Hppchen an (kleingeschnittenes Gemse, mundgerechte Obststckchen,                 hartgekochte Eischeiben, Joghurt, Vollkornbrot und Getreideflocken,                 Kse) und lassen Sie es essen, was es mchte. Manche Eltern haben                 gute Erfahrungen mit einem Knabbertablett  gemacht, wie Dr. William                 Sears es vorschlgt: Man fllt einen Eiswrfelbehlter, ein Muffinblech                 o.. mit verschiedenen Arten gesunder Lebensmittel und stellt es                 dem Kleinkind hin, so dass es den ganzen Tag ber davon naschen                 kann. Hier sind die aktuellen Lebensmittelpyramide-Empfehlungen fr Vorschulkinder                 (2-6 Jahre), die das amerikanische Landwirtschaftsministerium herausgegeben                 hat. Die Portionen sind fr vier- bis sechsjhrige Kinder gedacht.                 Zwei- bis Dreijhrige brauchen genauso viele, aber vielleicht kleinere                 Portionen als Vier- bis Sechsjhrige: ungefhr 2/3 einer Portion. Getreidegruppe: 6 Portionen (Eine Portion entspricht zum Beispiel einer Scheibe Brot, 120 ml gekochtem Reis oder Nudeln, 120 ml gekochtem Getreidebrei, 30 g Getreideflocken.)Gemsegruppe: 3 Portionen (Eine Portion entspricht zum Beispiel 120 ml gehacktem rohen oder gekochten Gemse oder 240 ml rohem Blattgemse.)Obstgruppe: 2 Portionen (Eine Portion entspricht zum Beispiel einem Stck Obst oder einer Scheibe Melone, 180 ml Saft, 120 ml Dosenobst, 60 ml Trockenobst.)Milchgruppe: 2 Portionen (Eine Portion entspricht zum Beispiel 240 ml Milch oder Joghurt, 60 g Kse)Fleischgruppe: 2 Portionen (Eine Portion entspricht zum Beispiel 60-80 g gekochtem mageren Fleisch, Geflgel oder Fisch, 120 ml gekochten getrockneten Bohnen.

Breastfeeding: the Numbers,http://kellymom.com/fun/trivia/bf-numbers/,"Breastfeeding rates in the United States and worldwideWhat percentage of moms breastfeed their babies? How long do they breastfeed? These questions have interested me, and prompted me to look for research that has been done. Im posting the results of my efforts here, for the benefit of anyone else who might be interested.Various Countries ComparedGlobal Data Base on Breastfeeding from World Health Organization/UNICEFState of the Worlds Children: Nutritionfrom World Health Organization/UNICEF.

Following are some useful links to their information:CDC: Breastfeeding Data and Statistics Current!Current Data from the CDC National Immunization SurveyBreastfeeding in the United States: Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2006 Breastfeeding by mothers 1544 years of age by year of babys birth, according to selected characteristics of mother: United States, average annual 197274 to 199394.US National Breastfeeding Rates. This shows the percentage of babies who received any breastmilk at all (at the breast or via alternative methods).US National Exclusive Breastfeeding Rates. Exclusive breastfeeding, as defined in this CDC survey, means that baby receives nothing but breastmilk (at the breast or via other feeding methods).Ross LabsUntil relatively recently, ironically enough, the primary source for statistical information on breastfeeding rates for the United States was Ross Labs (Ross Products Division, Abbott Laboratories), one of the major infant formula manufacturers. This used to be essentially the only source for breastfeeding statistics. Ross only collects information for babies up to 12 months old, since that is their primary sales market.View Ross Labs data & graph (1970-2003): [in this window] [in a different window]Breastfeeding after 12 months in the United StatesHills-Bonczyk SG, Tromiczak KR, Avery MD, Potter S, Savik K, Duckett LJ. Womens experiences with breastfeeding longer than 12 months. Birth. 1994 Dec;21(4):206-12.This study might be of interest to other mothers who breastfeed for more than a year. This information was taken from the abstract.Greater age, education, and weeks of exclusive breastfeeding were associated with longer duration of breastfeeding.68% of the women who breastfed longer than one year returned to employment before their infant was 1 year old.The most frequently chosen reason for long-term breastfeeding was that breastfeeding was a special time for mother and baby that the mother was not ready to give up.Nearly half of the women reported breastfeeding their babies on demand.At 12 to 15 months, 54% of the babies slept in a crib in a separate room. 37% slept in the same bed with their mother all or part of the night.57% of mothers considered their support group to be lightly or moderately important in influencing their decision to breastfeed beyond a year. 10% considered it to be extremely important.The major themes that emerged from women`s comments were the importance of being strong in the face of social unacceptability, development of a close mother-child bond, and the naturalness of breastfeeding beyond 12 months.Sugarman M, Kendall-Tackett KA. Weaning ages in a sample of American women who practice extended breastfeeding. Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1995 Dec;34(12):642-7.This study asked the question: Do US women who practice attachment-style parenting have weaning ages similar to women in more traditional cultures, or would they succumb to societal pressure to wean at earlier ages?The 179 women studied were recruited from La Leche League Area Conferences. All had nursed at least one child for six months or more. Weaning ages varied widely, ranging from one month to seven years, four months. The average age of weaning for children was 2.5 years (3 years for youngest children).Mothers still nursing at1 year83%2 years66%3 years44%Reasons for weaning included: child-led; related to a subsequent pregnancy; illness or family circumstances; not being able to diet seriously while nursing.When women who were currently nursing were asked how they would go about weaning, the majority indicated that weaning should be child-led. Mothers also indicated that they would cut down the number of nursing sessions, substitute other forms of love and nurse only when the child wanted to (practicing dont offer, dont refuse).The results of this study suggest that women who practice extended nursing and child-led weaning are likely to nurse well into early childhood. They are also consistent with the weaning ages found in traditional cultures.Worldwide Breastfeeding RatesAustraliaGrowing Up In Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, Annual Report 2006-07Breastfeeding in Australia, 2001 (9/17/2003), from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, presents data from the 1995 and 2001 National Health Surveys.The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents in Australia incorporating the Infant Feeding Guidelines for Health Workers, dated 10 April 2003, discusses historical and current breastfeeding rates in Australia (see Part 1.

Breastfeeding Quotes,http://kellymom.com/fun/trivia/bfquotes/,"If a multinational company developed a product that was a nutritionally balanced and delicious food, a wonder drug that both prevented and treated disease, cost almost nothing to produce and could be delivered in quantities controlled by the consumers needs, the very announcement of their find would send their shares rocketing to the top of the stock market. The scientists who developed the product would win prizes and the wealth and influence of everyone involved would increase dramatically. Women have been producing such a miraculous substance, breastmilk, since the beginning of human existence Gabrielle Palmer, in The Politics of Breastfeeding, London: Pandora Press, 1988, page 1.Breastfeeding is a natural safety net against the worst effects of poverty. If the child survives the first month of life (the most dangerous period of childhood) then for the next four months or so, exclusive breastfeeding goes a long way toward canceling out the health difference between being born into poverty and being born into affluence . It is almost as if breastfeeding takes the infant out of poverty for those first few months in order to give the child a fairer start in life and compensate for the injustice of the world into which it was born.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.James P. Grant, former Executive Director, UNICEFA pair of substantial mammary glands have the advantage over the two hemispheres of the most learned professors brain in the art of compounding a nutritive fluid for infants.Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894)When we trust the makers of baby formula more than we do our own ability to nourish our babies, we lose a chance to claim an aspect of our power as women. Thinking that baby formula is as good as breast milk is believing that thirty years of technology is superior to three million years of natures evolution. Countless women have regained trust in their bodies through nursing their children, even if they werent sure at first that they could do it. It is an act of female power, and I think of it as feminism in its purest form.

How will breastfeeding affect my morning sickness?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/18morningsickness/,"There is a plus and a minus to report. First it must be said that                 for some moms, breastfeeding sessions can trigger a sensation of                 nausea over and above regular morning sickness. Let-down in particular                 can bring on a feeling of nausea. On the plus side, many moms seem                 to suffer less morning sickness over all when they are breastfeeding.                 Indeed, some moms say that when they weaned the morning sickness                 hit the roof. (Does breastfeeding really reduce morning sickness?                 Sure seems that way, but only a study can tell us for sure.)  It can be very overwhelming to care for your child when you are                 nauseated and tired. Try different techniques for minimizing morning                 sickness, maximize nutrition when you are able to eat, and be creative                 in finding ways to adjust breastfeeding to minimize your discomfort.                 Making little adjustments both in how you arrange your nursling                 and how often/how long you nurse can sometimes help a lot. Positioning changes can be helpful for increasing moms comfort.                 Often the worst position for nursing when you are nauseated is when                 your child is resting on your belly. When you are sitting, can your                 child sit next to you, with knees pointing away? Does your child                 like side-lying? When youre on your back is there any way to prop                 up your childs body on a pillow alongside your body, so your child                 can still be nursing from above but not perched on your poor belly?                 Also, some moms find that seated nursing reduces nausea. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Some moms find that they can work through the nausea by making                 adjustments in nursing; others find that reduced nursing or weaning is ultimately for the best.

How will my milk change when I am breastfeeding through pregnancy?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/16milkchanges/,"Milk supply during pregnancyChanges in milk compositionWill I produce colostrum?Colostrum and stool changes in the older nurslingMilk changes after birthWill I have enough milk for two?Milk supply during pregnancyMost mothers who are nursing through pregnancy notice a decrease in milk supply by mid-pregnancy, but sometimes as early as the first month. During pregnancy, the mature milk is also making a gradual change to the colostrum which is present at birth. Supply may increase toward the end of pregnancy as colostrum production kicks in.Why does milk production usually decrease during pregnancy? Progesterone levels gradually rise during pregnancy. One theory for the cause of decreased milk supply during pregnancy (Flower 2003) is that the progesterone makes the alveoli permeable, or leaky, so they cant store milk well. At birth (the delivery of the placenta) progesterone levels drop dramatically, allowing prolactin to take over. Prolactin makes the alveoli impermeable, thus setting the stage for the return of copious milk production.The production of breastmilk depends upon adequate emptying of the breasts, but the supply and demand regulation of milk supply does not usually hold up when faced with the hormonal changes of pregnancy. The decrease in milk production usually occurs despite continued or increased nursing frequency, although a minority of pregnant mothers do not experience a decrease in milk supply. Obviously if your child does decrease demand, that will further decrease supply.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.When your milk supply begins to decrease, your nursling may respond by increasing or decreasing nursing frequency. Your child will most likely make up for decreased milk intake by eating more solids (indeed, increased solid food intake is one way that pregnant moms might track a decrease in milk supply). You can go ahead and encourage increased solid foods  just keep in mind that if your baby is under a year, milk should be his/her primary source of nutrition. As long as your baby is gaining weight adequately and nursing at least 3-4 times a day, he/she is unlikely to need an additional source of milk (see Is my older baby getting enough milk?).Many moms claim that eating oatmeal once a day helps their milk supply. There are also a number of herbs that can help to increase milk supply, but experts are generally not in agreement when it comes to safe use during pregnancy.Changes in milk compositionOne study compared changes in the milk of two lactating pregnant mothers through the first two months of pregnancy to daily changes in the milk of two women who were gradually weaning (Prosser, Saint & Hartmann 1984). Milk composition and volume changes during pregnancy were similar to those during gradual weaning, but the changes during pregnancy occurred despite continued or increased nursing, rather than in response to a decrease in nursing frequency.PregnancyGradual WeaningIncreased sodium, proteinIncreased sodium, proteinDecreased glucose, lactose, potassiumDecreased glucose, lactose, potassiumChanges were not related to nursing frequencyChanges were closely correlated to the decrease in nursing frequencySource: Prosser CG, Saint L, Hartmann PE. Mammary gland function during gradual weaning and early gestation in women. Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci. 1984 Apr;62 ( Pt 2):215-28.The changes that accompany the decrease in milk supply would be expected to affect the taste of the milk, and indeed some nursing toddlers mention the change in taste to mom. Once the milk is mostly/fully colostrum, the taste may change again. Some nurslings dont like the taste change (particularly when combined with the concurrent reduction in milk supply) and may wean as a result. Some love it. Others either dont seem to notice the change, continue nursing despite the change, or simply dont mind.Will I produce colostrum?Yes. The changeover between mature milk and colostrum production begins, on average, between the 4th and 8th month of pregnancy, but some mothers start producing colostrum somewhat earlier than that. Many mothers who nurse through pregnancy have noted that their milk contains mostly colostrum during the last month before baby is born. You will continue to produce colostrum throughout the latter part of your pregnancy  your older nursling cannot use it up.Colostrum and stool changes in the older nurslingIf your older nursling is getting a good quantity of colostrum (either before or after birth), the natural laxative effect of the colostrum may cause him/her to have looser and more frequent stools. The stools should return to normal once your colostrum is completely replaced with mature milk.Milk changes after birthAt birth, the sudden decrease in progesterone and estrogen levels (and resulting surge in prolactin levels) that occurs with the birth of the placenta causes colostrum production to kick into high gear and signals your milk to come in. Once your baby is born, the amount of time you produce colostrum is limited, since your mature milk will begin to come in within a few days.See also: Does my newborn always need to nurse first?Will I have enough milk for two?Both research and anecdotal evidence assure us that a mother breastfeeding two or more children (whether nursing siblings, twins, or more) has the capability to produce large amounts of milk (see Saint, Maggiore & Hartmann 1986). In one study a tandem nursing mother produced a double supply of milk for the entire 7 months that her older child nursed alongside the newborn (see Prosser 1984). As with any nursing relationship, factors like breast reduction surgery or adoption can affect the amount of milk produced, but the only supply concern generally reported by tandem nursing mothers is oversupply, rather than undersupply. See Got Milk? for more information on maintaining and increasing milk supply.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
How can I answer critics of tandem breastfeeding?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/11criticism/,"The first thing to bear in mind is that your breastfeeding relationship is a private one between yourself and your child. Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, you need not feel that you must defend or explain your choices.Having said that, it is also important to recognize that people who sound critical may simply be inexperienced with this topic. After all, most tandem nursing mothers simply find themselves there, its not usually something that mothers set out to do from the beginning.If you wish to offer a little education, you can let the other person know that it is safe (and point them to the latest information) and that breastfeeding offers nutritional and immunological advantages for the entire time a child nurses. Let them know that as the mother, you are assuming the responsibility to make decisions around your childrens health, and that after looking into it you judge this to be for the best. If the person worries that it will take a toll on you, let them know the ways in which continued breastfeeding is helping you, for instance in finding time to put your feet up while meeting the needs of baby and toddler. (You can also suggest a way for them to genuinely help you conserve your energy, by making lunch for your toddler or taking him to the park!) And when it comes to tandem nursing it is always fun to remind people that we have two breasts, and that yes, miraculously, a mothers body can make plenty of milk for all.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.See also: Handling criticism about breastfeedingFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Will I like tandem breastfeeding? Is worth the trouble?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/10tandemfeelings/,"Like everything else when a new baby first arrives, tandem nursing                 tends to be intense and unpredictable. Chances are it will be a                 godsend in many ways: helping with engorgement, helping meet the                 older childs needs and the babys needs simultaneously,                 keeping the older childs immunity up (so less illness, and                 shorter illnesses), providing incomparable nutrition for the older                 child, and providing a quick fix for temper tantrums. Moms who can                 comfortably nurse both children lying down may actually get to nap! Tandem nursing can also be stressful at times. You may need to                 nurse an over-tired toddler to sleep but the baby doesnt                 want you to lie down. You may find that nursing your older child                 causes an intense agitation (perhaps especially when the baby is                 also nursing). Some moms are disappointed to find that their breastfeeding                 relationship with their older child can feel negative for a while.                 Above all remember that your relationship with your older child                 can survive the bumps and surprises involved with adding a new baby                 to the mix. Many tandem nursing mothers find that the early weeks                 are the hardest and that they enjoy it much more after everyone                 is a little more settled.See also: Is                 it for me? Tips for Making Your Decision about Nursing                 during Pregnancy and Tandem NursingNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Kellys experience, written five months into tandem                 nursing:For me, it has been worth it. I have no regrets about continuing to nurse my daughter through my pregnancy and after, and feel like we would have had more difficulties had I tried to wean her before she was ready. I had no problems nursing through my pregnancy, aside from the usual things like sore nipples, which were annoying but manageable. Do keep in mind that every mom will have a different experience and different reactions to the hormones of pregnancy; some moms do find that nursing during pregnancy is intolerable  follow your own bodys lead. My daughter weaned down to 1-3 nursings a day (for comfort and going to sleep/waking up) during my pregnancy. Being able to lie down and nurse your toddler when youre pregnant can be a real help  particularly during the 1st & 3rd trimesters when you tend to be really tired. Tandem nursing has been challenging at times (particularly the first few weeks), but I feel that its been worth it so far. I will always remember how my daughter gave a big sigh of relief when I asked her if she wanted to nurse a few hours after her brother was born, even though wed been talking about them both nursing for months. So far we havent seen a whole lot of sibling rivalry, and big sister is enjoying and adapting well to her little brother (now 5 months old  time flies!).For many more personal experiences of mothers who have nursed through                 pregnancy and tandem nursed, see:Adventures in Tandem                 Nursing by Hilary FlowerFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Is it safe to breastfeed during pregnancy?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/01safety/,"Yes, in most cases. At this time no medical study has been done on the safety of breastfeeding during pregnancy so it is impossible to list any definitive contraindications. If you are having a complicated pregnancy, such as lost weight, bleeding, or signs of preterm labor, you should problem-solve your individual situation with your caregiver. Depending on your individual situation and feelings you may decide that continued breastfeeding, reduced breastfeeding, or weaning is for the best.Breastfeeding ContractionsAlthough uterine contractions are experienced during breastfeeding, they are a normal part of pregnancy. Similar contractions often occur during sexual intercourse, which many couples continue throughout pregnancy.Miscarriage/Preterm Labor RisksThis is a common worry, but it does not appear to have a strong foundation. A recent review of research on the pregnant uterus reveals that there is actually no theoretical basis for the common concern that breastfeeding can lead to miscarriage or preterm labor in healthy pregnancies. Instead the uterus has many safeguards preventing a strong reaction to the oxytocin that breastfeeding releases.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Interestingly, experts on miscarriage and preterm labor are not among those who see a potential link between breastfeeding and these pregnancy complications. Miscarriage expert Lesley Regan, PhD, MD, quoted in Adventures in Tandem Nursing, saw no reason that breastfeeding should impact pregnancy, even if the mother has a history of miscarriage or is experiencing a threatened miscarriage.Mothers healthThere is no evidence that a well nourished mother who nurses during pregnancy is at risk nutritionally. Breastfeeding does not increase a mothers risk for osteoporosis, even when the mother nurses during pregnancy. Breastfeeding reduces the mothers risk of breast cancer.Nurslings healthYour child will benefit from breastfeeding into the second year and beyond. The milk is just as safe during pregnancy, but pregnancy can cause milk to dwindle and can also motivate mother and child to wean. Thus if pregnancy does cause a child to receive less milk, the child will receive proportionally fewer of milks health advantages. Indeed, weaning before two years increases the risk of illness for a child, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.Is the milk safe for the toddler?Ingestion of hormones of pregnancy through human milk should not be harmful to the breastfeeding child, according to Thomas Hale, PhD, author of the authoritative text Medications and Mothers Milk. In lay persons terms, he says, the steroids, including many estrogens and progestins, pass poorly into milk sue to their steroid structures. Secondly, these hormones are not readily bioavailable in humans.

Myths vs Facts: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Tandem Nursing,http://kellymom.com/ages/tandem/myth-fact/,"PDF version (great for printing)By Hilary Flower, author ofAdventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyond, published by La Leche League International in July 2003You have probably heard most of these common statements circulating about breastfeeding during pregnancy and tandem nursing. I set out to test their veracity, and was surprised by what I found! Test the currency of your own knowledge: which statements are myth, fact, or simply unknown?1. At 24 weeks gestation, the uterus changes in such a way that breastfeeding goes from being safe to risky. MYTH or FACT?Myth. Oxytocin is a hormone released during breastfeeding that causes uterine contractions, usually too mild to notice. This fact has raised concern that breastfeeding could contribute to preterm labor in an otherwise healthy pregnancy. The uterus starts out pregnancy fairly insensitive to oxytocin, and somehow the rumor got started that it increases in sensitivity in mid-pregnancy. Research does not support this. Instead, the first marked increase occurs after the 37th weekwith little or nothing happening before that time.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.2. When you are breastfeeding during pregnancy, your body gives first to the fetus, then to the nursling, and then whats left over goes to your own daily needs and reserves. MYTH or FACT?Myth. If your body fat is already perilously low, you will want to note that malnourished women yield some body fat to contribute to fetal weight gain. But we have no research to tell us whether the fetus or nursling gets priority in times of shortage. More importantly, we have no reason to believe that anyone needs to come up short unless the mother is malnourished. Follow your appetite, eat enough calories of a basic mixed diet, and gain weight within the same parameters as if you werent breastfeeding, and your body will do the rest.3. The newborn always needs to nurse first. MYTH or FACT?Myth. Your newborn may need first dibs on colostrum since it is in limited supply in the first day or two. The sensation of your milk coming in indicates that your supply has exceeded your childrens demand; you can now count on plenty for both nurslings. Indeed, if you experience engorgement or an overly strong milk flow, your newborn may have an easier time if you nurse your toddler first!4. Most mothers experience a significant drop in milk supply during pregnancy. MYTH or FACT?Fact. 70% of mothers notice a significant drop in supply during pregnancy. Still, a minority of mothers continue to produce an abundance of milk throughout pregnancy.5. Tandem nursing mothers can make a double supply of milkjust like mothers nursing twins. MYTH or FACT?Fact. In one study a tandem nursing mother made a double supply of milk for the entire seven months that she tandem nursed (and her newborn was well above average in growth!). The only supply concern generally reported by tandem nursing mothers is oversupply.6. A majority of children self-wean during their mothers pregnancies. MYTH or FACT?Myth. It is true that a majority of children do wean during their mothers pregnancies; the question is: whos idea is it? In one study of La Leche League mothers breastfeeding during pregnancy, 26% of children self-weaned, 28% of the mothers led weaning, and the other 46% went on to tandem nurse.7. If you enjoy nursing your child before pregnancy, theres no reason to believe that pregnancy would change that. MYTH or FACT?Myth. Its important to note that pregnancy does tend to change breastfeeding as usual for many mothers. Some mothers find that nursing during pregnancy causes pain, agitation, or nausea, and such problems can affect their feelings about continuing. (Similarly some toddlers dont like the changes in flavor and supply of milk.)8. Tandem nursing will ensure a smooth sibling adjustment for your older child. MYTH or FACT?Myth. Your older child may experience a range of emotions, from fear of displacementto anger at youto delight in the new baby. And remember that sibling relationships tend to have their own rhythms of bonding and fighting, and both can happen at your breast! Realistic expectations, lots of mama love, open communication and a sense of humor will help you move through any challenges that arise.9. Breastfeeding reduces morning sickness. MYTH or FACT?Unknown! This appears to be true for many mothers (myself included) but only a scientific study could tell us whether statistics will bear this out or not. On the other hand, some unlucky moms do experience isolated bouts of nausea specifically during breastfeeding sessions.10. Tandem nursing mothers are martyrs. MYTH or FACT?Myth. It is true that nursing two children is a big commitment. On the other hand, weaning a reluctant child is no easy task either, particularly if you are pregnant or caring for a new baby. Each mother must choose the option she is most prepared to follow through on.BONUS QUESTION: Tandem nursing is rare. MYTH or FACT?Myth. Many mothers are careful about whom they tell, but this invisibility masks a common practice. In one study of 179 mothers who had breastfed at least one child for at least six months, 61% had breastfed during pregnancy, and 35% had tandem nursed.How did you do?For more information, see Nursing During Pregnancy and Tandem Nursing: The Official FAQ or read a chapter from Adventures in Tandem Nursing.REFERENCESFlower, 2003, pp. 223-230; Kimura T, et al.

What affects the amount of fat or calories in mom’s milk?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/change-milkfat/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCAverage calorie & fat content of human milkWhat affects the amount of fat and calories in a mothers milk?Does the amount of fat in moms milk make a difference when it comes to babys growth?Decreasing milk fat?Additional InformationReferencesAverage calorie & fat content of human                 milkThe average calorie content of human milk is 22                 kcal/oz. Caloric content varies widely throughout each feeding                 and the day, however, due to changing fat content. The amount of                 fat in human milk changes dramatically during each feeding and throughout                 the day, since fat content depends on the degree of emptyness of                 the breast (empty breast = high fat, full breast = low fat). The                 average fat content of human milk is 1.2                 grams/oz.Calorie & Fat Content of   Human MilkAverageRangeEnergy22   kcal/oz13    35 kcal/oz75 kcal/100   mL45  119 kcal/100   mLFat (total lipids)1.2   g/oz0.6    1.5 g/oz4.2 g/100   mL2  5 g/100   mL3-5%1-10%References:         Hamosh 1991, p. 118; Jelliffe & Jelliffe 1978; Lawrence 1999, p. 108, 305, 738.What affects the amount of fat and calories                 in a mothers milk?Moms diet? The research tells us that moms diet doesnotaffect the average amount of fat or calories in her milk. However, mom can change the types of fat in her milk by altering the types of fats that she eats (Lawrence 1999, p. 106-113, 300-305; Hamosh 1996, Hamosh 1991, p. 123-124). An increase of one fatty acid could generally be expected to occur concurrently with a decrease in another. For example, one study has shown that black mothers in South Africa who eat a traditional maize diet have less monunsaturated fatty acid in their milk than urban mothers who consumed more animal proteins and fats (van der Westhuyzen 1988).The degree of emptiness of the breast is what research has shown to drive breastmilk fat content, and thus calorie content. The fuller the breast, the lower the fat content of the milk; The emptier the breast, the higher the fat content of the milk (Daly 1993).

As noted earlier, average                 fat content of human milk is highly variable, but has not proven                 to be significant when calculating babys total energy intake or weight gain. (Aksit 2002, Butte                 1984, Cregan 1999, Mitoulas 2003, Mitoulas 2002.) Decreasing milk fat?It has been necessary in rare instances to decrease the                 fat content of breastmilk for certain medical conditions in baby                 (chylothorax).

The links above refer to such a situation and I included                 them in case anyone else encountered something similar. Babies and                 toddlers need fat for brain growth.

Commentary on formulas supplemented with DHA & ARA,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/dha-formula-comments/,"by Marsha Walker, RN, IBCLC. Reprinted with permission from the author.Note: These comments are from posts to a list serv for lactation providers and supporters, and are not from a peer reviewed journal.Date:Tue, 7 Jan 2003Subject:LipilDenny has talked to us about the pediatrician that stated the fatty acid additives in Lipil are exactly the same as what is in breast milk. This sounds like he or she has just attended an inservice by a formula salesman and is parroting back the buzz words used to dupe health care providers into recommending the formula! Actually these fatty acids are nothing like what is in breast milk and pose a number of known and unknown risks to the infants who consume them. The DHA is extracted from fermented microalgae and the ARA is extracted from soil fungus. The breast does not use either of these items to manufacture its fatty acids, and these sources are new to the food chain. Each of the processed oils has its own fatty acid composition, adding a number of fatty acids to formula that already are contained in the plant oils mixed into the base formula. Human fatty acids are structurally different from manufactured ones from plant sources. Human fatty acids interact with each other in a special matrix. Just because they perform as they do in human milk does not mean they will perform at all in an artificial construct. One study has started to question if the large fat supplementation of formula is contributing to the obesity epidemic (Massiera F. Arachidonic acid and prostacyclin signaling promote adipose tissue development: a human health concern. J Lipid Research 2002; published on line ahead of print November 4, 2002).Side effects have been reported in animal studies of the DHA and ARA, such as; oily soft stool (steatorrhea) and oily hair coat in rat studies. In four week exposures, rat pups had higher liver weights, in three month exposures they showed elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and undeveloped renal papilla. Fungal food sources have the potential of acting as opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised individuals. An extensive review of this topic was done published in the Journal of Nutrition, November 1998 Supplement; Vol 128, Number 11S. It concluded that there was not enough evidence to support the addition of these fatty acids to formula.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Varying or randomly adding fatty acids to formula does not always translate into optimal delivery of these fatty acids to the infant. These fatty acids were not approved by the FDA for use. They were simply allowed onto the market with the stipulation of post market surveillance. This means give the formula to as many babies as possible and see what happens. Since the clinical trials (experiments on babies) were done on small numbers, this allows the formula companies to have access to the entire population of babies born in the US every year, 4 million. The formulas are under study by the Institute of Medicine for safety. This represents an enormous uncontrolled experiment that bypasses informed consent and is staunchly defended by health care professionals who are wedded to the infant formula industry.NABA has received many, many reports of babies being fed Lipil and experiencing watery, explosive diarrhea. This needs to be reported to the manufacturer and the FDA as a side effect or adverse event of this formula. This is so similar to the selling of olestra (the stuff in potato chips that prevents a person from absorbing the fat which caused painful cramping and diarrhea in many adults) that it is a scary comparison. We do not know if babies lose fat, fat soluble vitamins or any other nutrients through the stool when they consume this formula. As a matter of fact, we know very little about this formula.Formula salesmen have walked onto hospital maternity units and removed all of the standard formula, lying that it is no longer being produced. This formula is more expensive than regular formula so the companies have profited greatly by making sure that the lower priced formula is not made available. How many more babies have to be made sick in order for the health care system and government regulatory agencies to pay attention to something put on the market to make money. The only thing these additives do is help a company capture a larger share of the formula market.The latest issue of INFACT Canadas newsletter carries a great tidbit of information from a few years ago when Martek Biosciences was recommended as a strong stock investment:  Infant formula is currently a commodity market, with all products being almost identical and marketers competing intensely to differentiate their product. Even if Formulaid (the name of the DHA/ARA fatty acid combination) has no benefit, we think it would be widely incorporated into formulas as a marketing tool and to allow companies to promote their formula as closest to human milk. No mention is made at all about health consequences because it is of no importance. Promoting formula in this manner is false and misleading advertising and is against the law.Health care providers who buy into the hype about this formula or Similac Advance have not done their homework. Maybe we need a conference on this topic to help people understand formulas and how to remove the marketing barrier to breastfeeding that they present.Marsha Walker, RN, IBCLCWeston, MADate:Wed, 8 Jan 2003Subject:LipilHalle and a number of other Lactnetters have asked my permission to use yesterdays post about Lipil and the addition of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) to formula. You may certainly use the post to help parents and health care professionals understand the nature of what we are dealing with and how they are being used by formula companies to make a profit. I keep finding more and more frightening things about tinkering with formula. For example, animal studies have begun to show that when these fatty acids are added to the diet and incorporated into plasma and tissue lipids it increases the susceptibility of membranes to lipid peroxidation and disrupts the antioxidant system. Breast milk is full of antioxidants that protect cells from the damaging effects of oxygen radicals (highly reactive chemicals). These oxygen radicals play a part in provoking diseases such as atherosclerosis, some forms of cancer, and a host of other diseases and conditions. (Song JH, et al. Polyunsaturated (n-3) fatty acids susceptible to peroxidation are increased in plasma and tissue lipids of rats fed docosahexaenoic acid-containing oils. J Nutrition 2000; 130:3028-3033).How can we know if formulas such as Lipil, Similac Advance, all the store brand formulas from Wyeth, the soy formulas, etc will or will not increase the susceptibility of infants fed these concoctions to the host of diseases and conditions that are already at epidemic levels. Will this diet simply exacerbate an already sad state of affairs, putting formula-fed babies at an even higher risk for poor health outcomes? The clinical trials of the supplemented formulas did not last longer than 12-18 months. We know nothing of what happens to people in the long term who consume only these formulas during infancy.Marsha Walker, RN, IBCLCWeston, MAAdditional resources compiled by kellymom.com:What should I know about infant formula? @ Do nursing mothers need DHA supplements? @ Replacing Mother Imitating Human Breast Milk in the Laboratory details research questioning the alleged benefits of adding novel omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, produced in laboratories and extracted from algae and fungus, into infant formulas.Simmer K.

Note: This wording is misleading, as infant formulas are never approved by the FDA. The FDA did not question the basis for the manufacturers GRAS notification (see below). Per the FDA, The law does not require that FDA approve infant formulas but instead requires companies to provide certain information to FDA before they market new infant formulas. Manufacturers must provide assurances that they are following good manufacturing practices and quality control procedures and that the formula will allow infants to thrive. If such assurances are not provided, FDA will object to the manufacturers marketing of the formula; however, the manufacturer may market the new infant formula over FDAs objection.Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation Of Infant Formula by Kathleen Meister, M.S.

Formula Companies and Free Gifts,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/formula-discharge-samples/,"SECOND OPINIONCOORDINATED BYKATHLEEN RICE SIMPSON, PHD,RNC, FAANThis article originally appeared in the MCN AM JNL MAT/CHLD NSG 1999:24 (3) : 119Internet permission to display this article granted by LLWShould Nurses Offer Discharge Formula Samples toWomen Who Plan to Breastfeed?PRO CONWriting for the Con PositionCINDY CURTIS. RN. IBCLC. andMAURENNE GRIESE. RNC. BSN. CCE, CBEThe Impact of Formula Discharge Packs on BreastfeedingMany health professionals today would say they support breastfeeding yet our actions speak louder than words. What message do we send to consumers of health care when we, the health care professional, distribute free formula to patients during their prenatal course, hospitalization and upon discharge? The US health care system is fraught with promotion of infant formula, a practice that needs to be discontinued.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Some believe that it is a wonderful idea to be able to give free samples of formula, literature and gifts to consumers of obstetrical health care, including literature produced by formula companies on breastfeeding. One might be tempted to look at the quality of the brochure or pamphlet only. However, there is a larger principle present that free materials arent really free at all. Who pays the author, artist, printer etc to develop these materials? Certainly not breastfeeding women. The answer is the people who buy the products from the formula company. Mothers who dont breastfeed, either because they dont want to, cant, wont or shouldnt. American taxpayers, people like us, pay for the $600 million of free infant formula for WIC annually. People who run homeless shelters, food banks and other hunger programs also pay the price of free samples. According to the Attorney General of Florida, for each dollar charged for infant formula, the manufacturer spends only sixteen cents on production and delivery. With this astounding profit margin, is it no wonder that formula companies can afford to provide free literature, samples and gifts to consumers and health care professionals?Distributing or accepting these and the myriad other free gifts that formula companies distribute to consumers and health care professionals means increasing a financial burden on bottle feeding mothers, taxpayers, and those who financially support hunger agencies. The fact of the matter is that formula companies produce breastfeeding literature and breastfeeding discharge kits for one purpose only-to increase the sales of their products. Is this in the best interest of our patients? Is this a conflict of interest for us as professionals?There is a substantial body of scientific evidence to support our opinion that formula discharge packs do affect breastfeeding in a negative manner. A recent article in the journal Birth countered this evidence by concluding that the practice of distributing formula discharge packs did not affect breastfeeding. However, the women involved in this study were provided with appropriate follow-up, which doesnt happen everywhere in the US. Additionally, Ross Labs funded the study, a major manufacturer of infant formula. Who does one believe? The fact remains that exclusive breastfeeding, even in the early months of infancy, is not commonplace. Early supplementation reduces the mothers milk supply and increases her dependence on formula. How many breastfeeding brochures promote early supplementation with formula? This early supplementation is encouraged by formula manufacturers so that mothers buy their product for a longer period of time, wean from the breast earlier and continue using formula through the first year of life. What a brilliant marketing tool!Some health care professionals may discard the formula, literature and coupons from the diaper bags and give mothers the diaper bag manufactured by the formula company. The problem with this practice is that the mother who receives the diaper bag only is still exposed to a marketing practice known as brand sampling or recognition. Shell recognize the name or logo on her bag with the formula company. If we discontinue this practice, some believe that mothers will feel cheated or left out because they didnt receive a free diaper bag at their hospital upon discharge. Is there data to support continuation of this practice? Of even greater concern is the mother who encounters a breastfeeding problem. In some situations, she may use the formula she received upon discharge from the hospital instead of seeking assistance from a knowledgeable health care provider or La Leche League Leader. The practice of formula discharge pack distribution impresses upon the mother that the hospital endorses that particular brand when in fact it is usually the lowest bidder who obtains the privilege to supply the hospital with that brand. Do health care professionals wish to continue being unpaid sales representatives for the formula companies? Some may argue that they arent unpaid when they accept free food, training and gifts from a formula company, a practice that the authors, along with many other lactation professionals, discourage. These practices that occur in clinics and hospitals across the US are in direct violation of the WHO/UNICEF International Code of Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes. According to WHO/UNICEF, between one and two million infants worldwide die each year due to artificial feeding. It was also WHO that first recommended that infants be breastfed for at least two years.While most of the United Nations countries signed onto the Code in the early 1980s, the US withheld its support of the Code until the Clinton administration voiced its approval in 1994. The Code bans all promotion of bottle-feeding and sets out requirements for labeling and information on infant feeding products. Any activity which undermines breastfeeding also violates the Code. The Codes main points are for no promotional efforts to consumers, health care professionals or hospitals yet these violations continue in hospitals and clinics across the country.We have serious concerns about the ethics of this practice and the relationships many health care professionals, hospitals and clinics have with formula companies. For example, do other hospital units distribute free gifts or food from commercial companies to their patients? All other hospital units charge for patient food-why not the nursery? Perhaps the question we should be asking ourselves is not how do formula discharge packs affect breastfeeding and instead ask what would happen to formula sales if this practice were discontinued?REFERENCESBliss, M.

MAURENNE GRIESE is Director, Educational Services, Mercy Health Center of Manhattan, Manhattan, Kansas.Writing for the Pro PositionDOTTIE C. JAMES, PhD, RN, and MAUREEN PIMLEY, RNCIn our opinion, it is a disservice to women to assume that the presence of formula samples will discourage breastfeeding in new mothers. Perinatal nurses know that breastfeeding is the best method for feeding infants during the first year of life. The United States has identified a national health goal of 75% of women choosing to breastfeed, and 50% continuing to breastfeed at 6 months postpartum. Few professionals would argue against the belief that breastfeeding is best for infants. However, nurses must also respect womens right to choose the feeding method they feel is best. Although the discharge diaper bags designed for breastfeeding mothers usually contain formula samples and coupons, most also have handy reusable ice packs and sterile bottles for storing frozen breast milk during an outing with the baby or for use to store milk after pumping while at work.Much research has been done about this topic. As early as 1986 research showed that discharge packs containing formula samples did not sabotage breast-feeding (Feinstein, Berkelhamer, Grusz-ka, Wong, & Carey, 1986). This was a double-blind controlled study of 166 mothers that followed women for 4 months and found the variables with the greatest impact on the duration of breastfeeding were: initiation of nursing after 16-hours-of-age, partial breastfeed-ing (planned supplementation with formula), and formula supplementation in the hospital. Other research has yielded similar findings (Bliss. Wilkie, Acredolo. Berman, &z Tebb, 1997; Dungy, Losch. Russell, Romitti, & Dusdieker. 1997: Evans, Lyons, &T Killten, 1986). Bliss and colleagues (1997) studied more than 1,600 mothers who were given one of four discharge packs that contained either: powdered formula; breast pump; formula and breast pump; or neither. After a 6-month follow up that included three phone contacts, there was no over-all effect on the duration of breastfeeding and only a modest effect on the incidence of supplementation with the group that was given formula samples.Some nurses feel that giving the gift packs constitutes an endorsement of the use of formula. If so, are the coupons and samples of disposable diapers we routinely give out an endorsement of disposables over cloth diapers? We dont think so. These are merely opportunities for mothers to examine a product and make an intelligent decision on their own.In our opinion. to suggest that a discharge gift pack influences feeding options presumes that women do not make thoughtful choices about feeding their babies. Nursing support is a key element in successful breastfeeding. How many nurses have become frustrated with a sleepy newborn or a nervous mother? How many have suggested a little formula to get over the rough spots ,or to let the mother sleep in? If new mothers receive appropriate education and support during their hospitalizations, perhaps they will leave the hospital armed with the techniques and confidence to continue breastfeeding at home. Part of this education must include community resources such as professionally staffed hotlines, La Leche League, and new mothers support groups. New breast-feeding mothers must feel that they are not alone, but rather part of a network of mothers providing the optimal source of nutrition for their newborns. Lets not give a diaper bag and formula powder more power than it deserves. It is easier to blame discharge packs than to focus on the more difficult areas of nursing practice and attitude. Let each of us do what we can to positively influence new mothers and provide the support and education that make it possible for all women who choose this method to successfully breastfed.If perinatal nurses are committed to increasing the rate of breastfeeding among new mothers, we will modify our practice and make it a reality.REFERENCESBliss, M.

They appear in large numbers in special aggregations in the gut  the Peyers patches. These lymphocytes leave the gut after having met bacteria and viruses there and move or home to exocrine glands such as the mammary, lacrimal and salivary glands, as well as glands in the mucosal membranes of the bronchi and the gut. As a consequence, human milk contains sIgA antibodies against all those bacteria and viruses which have been in the mothers gut. This gives the milk capacity to protect against those microorganisms to which the infant is exposed, because they are usually the same as those its mother has been in contact with. source: L A Hanson et al. Breastfeeding protects against infections and allergy. Breastfeeding Review; Nov l988 , pp l9  22.Some of the immune factors in breastmilk have been shown to increase in concentration as the baby gets older and nurses less, so older babies still receive lots of immune factors. So as a baby starts to nurse less (weaning) and milk supply decreases, the concentration of immunities increases. This isnt age-dependent, but depends on the amount of milk that baby is removing from the breast. [source: Goldman AS et al. Immunologic components in human milk during weaning.

What should I know about infant formula?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/infant-formula/,"Parents consider giving their babies formula for many reasons. In somecases it is medically necessary. At other times, mom may believe that her milk supply is low (and thus think that formula is needed) when her supply is actuallyfine. Sometimes its simply the parents choice. If you feel that your baby has a need for formula supplementation (or your babys doctor has suggested or recommended it) and you wish to continue breastfeeding, then contact a lactation consultant (preferably IBCLC) for guidance. A good lactation consultant can assess the need for supplementation and guide you in the use of supplements tosupportyour own breastfeeding goals.Keep in mind that formula (like a medication) comeswith its own set of risks, and parentsneed to be aware of these so theycan make an informed decision onits use.The use of formula canshorten the breastfeedingrelationship, and comes withincreased health risks forbaby and mother(even in the US and other developed countries). Parents shouldlook at their individual circumstances and decide whether the benefits offormula use outweigh the risks.Alternatives to formula include amothers own milk (the best choice when available can be fed directly or expressed)oranother mothers milk (from a milk bank, private donor, family member, or friend).Remember thatbreastfeeding does not have to be all or nothing  any amount of breastfeeding is beneficial to both mom and baby.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Following are some links to information on infant formula and alternatives.Need to use formula?

Is it safe to use cow’s milk or other milks as a supplement to breastfeeding?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/milk/milk-supplements/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCGeneral GuidelinesCows MilkYogurt & cheeseAdditional Information on Cows MilkGoats MilkAdditional Information on Goats MilkGeneral GuidelinesIn general, only breastmilk or formula should be used if your baby is less than six months old.Between six and twelve months, supplementing with solids (instead of formula) or very small amounts of cow, goat, soy or rice milk is less of a problem, as long as baby is still nursing for the majority of milk intake and baby is not allergic. However, babies under a year are more at risk for allergic reactions (see below) so it can be a good idea to wait.After a year, other milks may be used, but are not needed (other sources provide the same nutrients). Its recommended that you limit the amount of cows milk that your child receives (possibly other milks too, except breastmilk) to 2-3 cups (16-24 ounces) per day. Too much cows milk in a childs diet can put him at risk for iron-deficiency anemia (because milk can interfere with the absorption of iron) and decrease the childs desire for other foods. More here on cows milk after a year.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Cows MilkUse of cows milk before a year is controversial among experts. You might want to get your babys doctors opinion on this.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends NO cows milk until after the first birthday.Cows milk is more specific to a baby cow than a baby human. Cows milk formula is based on cows milk but has been engineered to be closer to human milk (still a ways off, but closer). Many infants still have problems with cows milk formula (allergies, GI problems, etc.). Babies who are exposed to cows milk before their first birthday are more likely to be anemic, have diarrhea or vomiting, and/or experience an allergic reaction (the proteins in milk are more numerous than those in other milk products, such as the yogurt). The excessive protein load in cows milk can also overload a babys kidneys. It is deficient in vitamins C, E, and copper. It is harder to digest as well, often causing intestinal blood loss. A number of studies have also indicated that early introduction of cows milk may contribute to the development of Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus.Others see no problem with starting cows milk toward the end of the first year unless there is a family history of allergy to it. Dr. Jack Newman, a renowned expert in the lactation field, is one of these. See the Breastmilk, cows milk, formula, outside work and bottles section of his article Breastfeeding and Other Foods. Notice that he qualifies this advice with the importance of the baby being well-established on a variety of solids and continuing to be breastfed (both of which should help make up for what cows milk cant offer at this age). He also suggests that supplemental milk of any kind is not all that necessary if the baby is allowed to nurse frequently when with mom. He suggests offering the baby solid foods with some water or small amounts of juice instead.Yogurt and cheeseSome experts consider yogurt and cheese to be okay for most babies after 6 months. Others prefer waiting until 9-12 months. Of course, if baby has a cows milk allergy or there is a strong history of allergy to cows milk in the family, yogurt, cheese and all other foods made with cows milk should be avoided until 12 months or later. The main difference between yogurt and milk is that the lactose in yogurt has been converted into lactic acid. Cheese differs from milk in two ways: the whey proteins are drained off in the cheese-making process (so only casein proteins remain), and the curdling enzymes break down the casein proteins into smaller protein molecules. For babies and toddlers, try to find the whole milk yogurt (not low or no fat), and avoid the yogurt with artificial sweeteners lots of sugary fruits.Additional Information on Cows MilkMichaelsen KF.

Goats milk is no more appropriate to give baby than cows milk. If you need to supplement and breastmilk is not available, formulas are a more nutritionally complete product. There are several comparisons of goat vs. cow vs. human milk in the links below. Using this information, goat milk is much closer in composition to cow milk than human milk. Goats milk is high in sodium (like cows milk) and is very high in chloride and potassium, which makes the renal solute load too high for babies. This can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and can result in anemia and poor growth (these problems are usually undetected until months later). Goat milk is also deficient in folic acid, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Also, infants who are allergic to cows milk protein are often allergic to goats milk too.While its true that whole goats milk (and whole cows milk) was commonly used prior to the advent of infant formulas it is also true that the infant mortality and morbidity rate during the times of such substitutions was very high.Additional Information on Goats MilkQ&AsWhat About Goats Milk? by Lynn M.

Religious Fasting and Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/fasting/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCSpecific guidelinesJewish law exempts from fasting anyone whose health might be even a little harmed by it  this would include pregnant and nursing women whose health (or the health of her baby or fetus) might suffer from fasting. There may be ways of eating and drinking small increments that are still compatible with fasting. However, a local competent Orthodox rabbinic authority should be consulted so that the method and amounts of eating and drinking will be done within the correct guidelines.Muslim women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may be exempt from fasting if they feel that their health or the babys health would be negatively affected by the fasting. The mother may be expected to compensate for the missed fasting at a later time or pay some expiation for not fasting. Consult a scholar or a book of fiqh to determine the appropriate guidelines.Roman Catholic mothers who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excused from fast or abstinence according to need for meat or nourishment.  from Catholic.orgNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.[Latter-day Saint] nursing mothers may do well to skip fasting. And there are others with special situations, temporary or permanent, who should not fast.  from LDS.orgThe [Bah] Faith exempts from fasting those who are ill, elderly, traveling, pregnant, nursing, menstruating or engaged in heavy labor.  from Bahai.usThe [Orthodox Christian] Church has always exempted small children, the sick, the very old, and pregnant and nursing mothers from strict fasting.  from The Fasting Rule of the Orthodox ChurchHow does fasting affect the breastfeeding mother and child?Breastfeeding research tells us that short-term fasting (not eating) will not decrease milk supply, but that severe dehydration can decrease milk supply. Fasting does affect the biochemical/nutrient content of breastmilk to a certain extent.There have been a few studies on fasting and breastfeeding (see the references below). Zimmerman et. al. (2009) tested the milk of Israeli women before and after religious fast days and found a number of biochemical changes in the milk associated with fasting 24+ hours. Studies in the United States by Neville et. al. (1993), Neville & Oliva-Rasbach (1987) and Tigas et. al. (2002) likewise showed no significant decrease in milk supply after a short fast (the women in these studies did drink water during the fast). The breastfeeding womans body appears to make several metabolic adaptations during short-term fasting to ensure that milk production is not affected.Rakiciolu et. al. (2006) studied mothers with babies aged 2-5 months who fasted during Ramadan (no food or fluids between 5:00 am and 7:30 pm). They found that although infant growth and macronutrient content of breastmilk was not affected, levels of several nutrients in breastmilk (zinc, magnesium and potassium) decreased and the nutritional status of the breastfeeding mothers was affected. These authors noted that it would seem prudent to excuse lactating women from fasting during Ramadan. Prentice et. al. (1983) studied women in West Africa who were fasting for Ramadan and found that milk volume was not affected but milk composition did change to a certain extent. The researchers noted that the women appeared to superhydrate themselves overnight when fluids were allowed to lessen daytime dehydration.Mothers may want to err on the safe side, and drink water even if they are not eating. There are two risks to not drinking all day: (1) mom gets dehydrated, and (2) if the dehydration is severe enough milk supply can decrease. Moms dehydration is comparatively easy to deal with  if she feels thirsty (or urine gets very yellow, or she feels dizzy or ill) she needs to drink. The decrease in milk supply related to dehydration may be a bigger issue for some fasting mothers  some mothers have a hard time getting supply back up (this is often seen in mothers who dont eat or drink due to illness). When a mother does not drink fluids for a day, baby generally nurses as usual the day of the fast, but often needs to nurse more often the next day or two.Some mothers have found that drinking water on fast days is more of a need during the first six months when baby is exclusively breastfed (not taking any food or drink other than breastmilk); once baby is older and taking other foods, it may be feasible to neither eat nor drink during the fast.Keep in mind that mothers who have sugar metabolism problems (diabetes or hypoglycemia) or other health problems, fasting could be risky (for mom). Consult both your doctor and your religious advisor if you feel that you might have health issues that preclude fasting.Additional information and referencesPregnancy, Nursing, and Ramadan by Stacey Greaves-FavorsBreastfeeding during Ramadan byDr. Naomi Mirza, Medical Specialist at maya.com.bdFasting According to Five Islamic Schools of Law by Allamah Muhammad Jawad MaghniyyaAdvice to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers from IslamwebFasting for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers from Principles of Fiqh at islamqa.infoFascinating research on Ramadan fasting gives breastfeeding mothers food for thought from the Sharjah Baby Friendly Emirate Campaign (2012)Breastfeeding and Fasting from BabyCenter UKFasting on Yom Kippur During Pregnancy byHannah KatsmanBreastfeeding and Jewish Law from the Nishmat Womens Online Information Center (includes some Q&As on fasting)Eidelman AL.

Do breastfeeding mothers need extra calories or fluids?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/mom-calories-fluids/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCCalories | FluidsDo breastfeeding mothers need extra calories?In general, you should simply listen to your body and eat to appetite  this is usually all you need to do to get the calories you need. When exclusively nursing a young baby, it is very common to feel hungry much of the time listen to your body. Mothers of older babies may feel hungrier when baby temporarily increases his or her milk intake (for example, during a growth spurt) again, listen to your body. Counting calories is rarely necessary unless you are having problems maintaining a healthy weight.If you really want (or need) to count caloriesStudies have shown that most healthy breastfeeding women maintain an abundant milk supply while taking in 1800-2200 (or more) calories per day. Consuming less than 1500-1800 calories per day (most women should stay at the high end of this range) may put your milk supply at risk, as may a sudden drop in caloric intake. (See Can I diet while breastfeeding? for more information on calorie restriction).A mothers baseline need for calories (not including lactation) depends upon her activity level, weight and nutritional status. A mother who is less active, has more fat stores, and/or eats foods higher in nutritional value may need fewer calories than a mom who is more active, has fewer fat stores, and/or eats more processed foods. This link from the Childrens Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine has more information (including a handy calculator) on determining your individual caloric needs: Research helps fine-tune a womans true caloric needs.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.An exclusively breastfeeding mother, on average, needs to take in 300-500 calories per day above what was needed to maintain pre-pregnancy weight. Since the recommended added calories during the last two trimesters of pregnancy is 300 calories/day, an exclusively breastfeeding mother will typically need either the same amount of calories she was getting at the end of pregnancy, or up to 200 additional calories per day. Thats the equivalent of adding 1-2 healthy snacks per day.Per Breastfeeding and Human Lactation (Riordan, 2004, p. 438), The amount of energy needed by lactating mothers continues to be debated. The lactating mother need not maintain a markedly higher caloric intake than that maintained prior to pregnancy: in most cases, 400-500 calories in excess of that which is needed to maintain the mothers body weight is sufficient.The number of additional calories needed for nursing depends on:The extent of breastfeeding:Is your child exclusively breastfed, mostly breastfed, or breastfed 1-2 times per day? If your nursling is only partially breastfed (for example, an older child who is getting less milk, or a younger child who is getting formula supplements), calorie requirements would be proportionally less.Moms fat reserves:Is your body mass index [BMI] low, high or in-between? A mom who does not have any spare fat reserves (and most of us do!) will need the greatest number of extra calories. Maternal fat stores typically provide about 200 calories per day towards lactation, so if your BMI is low (particularly if youre considered very underweight, or BMI<19.8) you will need to get extra calories from your diet.Do breastfeeding mothers need extra fluids?The Institute of Medicine notes that the median amount of fluids typically consumed by breastfeeding mothers is 3.1 liters (13 cups), compared to 2.2 liters/9 cups for non-pregnant/lactating women and 2.3 liters/10 cups for pregnant women. This is not necessarily the exact amount of water you yourself will need  the IOM points out, Given the extreme variability in water needs that are not solely based on differences in metabolism, but also in environmental conditions and activity, there is not a single level of water intake that would ensure adequate hydration and optimal health for half of all apparently healthy persons in all environmental conditions the AI [Adequate Intake] does not represent a requirement; it is an amount that should meet the needs of almost everyone in the specific life stage group under the conditions described.It is not necessary to force fluids; drinking to satisfy thirst is sufficient for most mothers to stay hydrated. Pay attention to your bodys signals  busy mothers often ignore thirst if there is nothing nearby to drink  try to keep a drink near where you usually breastfeed baby or at your desk at work. Pumping moms may find that they need to pay more attention to remembering to stay hydrated. Signs that you are not getting enough fluids include concentrated urine (darker, stronger smelling than usual) and constipation (hard, dry stools).Unless you are severely dehydrated, drinking extra fluids (beyond thirst) is not beneficial, may cause discomfort, and does not increase milk supply. Nancy Mohrbachers Breastfeeding Made Simple (2010) notes, Contrary to popular belief, drinking more fluids is not associated with greater milk production. In Nutrition During Lactation, the IOM summarizes: It is widely assumed that milk production requires a high fluid intake on the part of the mother, yet the evidence suggests that lactating women can tolerate a considerable amount of water restriction and that supplemental fluids have little effect on milk volume thirst may sometimes function too slowly to prevention dehydration among women with high fluid losses resulting from exercise or high ambient temperature (experienced by many women without air conditioning in the summer). Thus, careful attention to adequacy of fluid intake is warranted in such situations, but under most conditions there appears to be no justification for emphasizing high fluid intake as a way to improve milk production. [See the references below for more information.]For mothers who are engorged, attempting to reduce breastmilk oversupply, or weaning  research has shown that decreasing fluids does not reduce engorgement or suppress milk supply.Breastfeeding mothers are sometimes warned that Only water counts! when it comes to fluid intake, but this simply doesnt make sense  your body can utilize water from many sources, including vegetables, fruit, soup, water, fruit & vegetable juices, milk, tea and other beverages. The foods that you eat accounts for about one-fifth of total fluid intake (IOM, 2004). Some fluids are certainly more nutritious than others, but even soda will provide fluids you need (although it may also provide sugars, caffeine*, etc. that you do not need).* The Institute of Medicine (2004) notes that It has long been thought that consumption of caffeinated beverages, because of the diuretic effect of caffeine on reabsorption of water in the kidney, can lead to a total body water deficit. However, available data are inconsistent. Hence, unless additional evidence becomes available indicating cumulative total water deficits in individuals with habitual intakes of significant amounts of caffeine, caffeinated beverages appear to contribute to the daily total water intake similar to that contributed by noncaffeinated beverages.Additional information@ Nutrition for mom while nursing during pregnancy or tandem nursingCan I continue to breastfeed if I work out/exercise?Can I diet while breastfeeding?Breastfeeding and Moms Diet@ other websitesNutrition, Exercise, and Weight Loss While Breastfeeding by Anne Smith, IBCLCParpia Khan SL.

How does a mother’s diet affect her milk?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/mom-diet/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCDo I need to maintain a perfect diet while breastfeeding?What IS needed for maintaining an ample supply of milk?How does moms nutrient intake affect breastfeeding?Are there any foods that nursing mothers should avoid?Additional information Do I need to maintain a perfect diet while breastfeeding?The short answer to this question is NO  you do not need to maintain a perfect diet in order to provide quality milk for your baby. In fact, research tells us that the quality of a mothers diet has little influence on her milk. Nature is very forgiving  mothers milk is designed to provide for and protect baby even in times of hardship and famine. A poor diet is more likely to affect the mother than her breastfed baby.Its common to hear women say that they want to wean (or not breastfeed at all) because they miss drinking coffee, or want to have an occasional glass of wine, or dont like worrying constantly about everything they eat. Guess what? You can drink caffeinated beverages (in moderation), have an occasional drink, eat what you want and still provide your baby with the absolute best nutrition and immunological protection  mothers own milk.According to Katherine A. Dettwyler, Ph.D., breastfeeding researcher and anthropologist, women throughout the world make ample amounts of quality milk while eating diets composed almost entirely of rice (or millet or sorghum) with a tiny amount of vegetables and occasional meat.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Are healthy eating habits recommended for mom? Absolutely! You will be healthier and feel better if you eat well. It is best for anyone to eat a variety of foods, in close to their naturally-occurring state, but this is not necessary for providing quality milk or for maintaining milk supply. Although it is certainly not recommended, a breastfeeding mother could live on a diet of junk food  mom would not thrive on that diet, but her milk would still meet her babys needs.What IS needed for maintaining an ample supply of milk?The main thing needed to maintain an ample milk supply is simple The more often and effectively your baby nurses, the more milk you will have.Occasionally, a mothers calorie or fluid intake can affect milk production:Calories: In general, you should simply listen to your body and eat to appetite  this is usually all you need to do to get the calories you need. Counting calories is rarely necessary unless you are having problems maintaining a healthy weight. Excessive dieting can reduce milk supply, but sensible dieting is generally not a problem.Liquids: It is not necessary to force fluids; drinking to satisfy thirst is sufficient for most mothers. Unless you are severely dehydrated, drinking extra fluids is not beneficial, may cause discomfort, and does not increase milk supply. It is not necessary to drink only water  our bodies can utilize the water from any fluid.The main message on calories and fluids  Eat when hungry & drink when thirsty.See Do nursing mothers need extra calories or fluids? and How does milk production work? for more information.How does my nutrient intake affect breastfeeding?Vitamin/mineral supplements (prenatal or otherwise) are not considered necessary if you eat a reasonably well balanced diet. See Vitamins (& other supplements) for Nursing Moms for more information.Your fat intake does not affect the amount of fat in your milk, but can affect the kinds of fats (balance of good vs. bad fats) in your milk to some extent. See What affects the amount of fat or calories in moms milk? for more information.Are there any foods that I should avoid while Im breastfeeding?There are NO foods that you should avoid simply because you are breastfeeding. It is generally recommended that a nursing mother eat whatever she likes, whenever she likes, in the amounts that she likes and continue to do this unless baby has an obvious reaction to a particular food.Its suggested that everyone, particularly pregnant and nursing mothers, avoid eating certain types of fish that are typically high in mercury.It is a good idea to restrict caffeine and alcohol to a certain extent, but it is rarely necessary to eliminate them.Some food proteins (such as cows milk protein or peanut protein) do pass into mothers milk. If there is a history of food allergies in your family, you may wish to limit or eliminate the allergens common in your family.Any baby might react to a particular food (although this is not very common). If baby has an obvious reaction every time you eat a certain food, it may be helpful to eliminate that food from your diet. For more information, see Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies.Making women think that they must maintain perfect diets in order to have thriving breastfed babies is an unnecessary obstacle to breastfeeding.Additional information@ FAQs about Moms Diet VitaminsDo nursing mothers need extra calories or fluids?What affects the amount of fat or calories in moms milk?Can a nursing mother eat this food?Can I diet while breastfeeding?Can I continue to breastfeed if I work out/exercise?Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies@ other websites FAQ Sheet: Frequently Asked Questions on Breastfeeding and Maternal Nutrition from the LINKAGES ProjectHow long does it take for what I eat to get into my breastmilk? by Anne Smith, BA, IBCLCNutrition for Breastfeeding Moms by Paula YountNutrition, Exercise, and Weight Loss While Breastfeeding by Anne Smith, BA, IBCLCMaternal protein-energy nutrition and breastfeeding by Ted Greiner, Ph.D.Latham MC.

Fenugreek Seed for Increasing Milk Supply,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/fenugreek/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCWhat is a galactagogue? Do I need one?Herbal safety for nursing moms (general information)Effect on milk productionSuggested dosageSafetyPossible side effects and cautionsDrug interactionsFenugreek use during pregnancyPossible side effects for babyWhere to get fenugreekOther uses for fenugreekOther names for fenugreekNutritional profileReferencesAdditional InformationFenugreek and BreastfeedingGeneral InformationResearchTraditional UseHistoric InformationEffect on milk productionFenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) appears to be the herb that is most often used to increase milk supply. It has been reported to be an excellent galactagogue for some mothers, and has been used as such for centuries. The few studies that have been done have had mixed results [Swafford 2000, Reeder 2011, Turkylmaz 2011] . Keep in mind that in almost all cases, non-pharmaceutical methods of increasing milk supply should be tried first, as there can be significant side effects from both herbal remedies and prescription medications used to increase milk supply. See the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicines protocol #9 on the use of galactogogues.Mothers generally notice an increase in production 24-72 hours after starting the herb, but it can take two weeks for others to see a change. Some mothers do not see a change in milk production when taking fenugreek.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Dosages of less than 3500 mg per DAY have been reported to produce no effect in many women. One way reported to determine if youre taking the correct dosage is to slowly increase the amount of fenugreek until your sweat and urine begin to smell like maple syrup. If youre having problems with any side effects, discontinue use and consider alternative methods of increasing milk supply.Fenugreek has been used either short-term to boost milk supply or long-term to augment supply and/or pumping yields. There are no studies indicating problems with long-term usage. Per Kathleen Huggins Most mothers have found that the herb can be discontinued once milk production is stimulated to an appropriate level. Adequate production is usually maintained as long as sufficient breast stimulation and emptying continues [Huggins].Dosages often suggested:(check with your lactation consultant and medical care provider for information specific to your individual circumstances)capsules(580-610 mg)2-4 capsules, 3 times per day6-12 capsules (total) per day~1200-2400 mg, 3 times per day (3.5-7.3 grams/day)German Commission E recommends a daily intake of 6 gramscapsules(500 mg)7-14 capsules (total) per daypowder or seeds1/2  1 teaspoon, 3 times per day1 capsule = 1/4 teaspooncan be mixed with a little water or juicetincture1-2 mL, 3 times per day (see package directions)teaone cup of tea, 2-3 times per daySafetyFenugreek is used to flavor artificial maple syrup, and is used as a common food ingredient (curries, chutneys, etc.) and traditional medicine in many parts of the world, including India, Greece, China, north Africa and the Middle East. It is a basic ingredient of curry powder (often used in Indian cooking) and the Five Spice mixtures (used in Asian cooking). It is also eaten as a salad and sprouted.Fenugreek is considered safe for nursing moms when used in moderation and is on the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations GRAS list (Generally Recognized As Safe). As with most medications and herbs, various side effects have been noted; see the side effects and safety information below.Per Hale [Hale 2012], The transfer of fenugreek into milk is unknown, untoward effects have only rarely been reported. Hale classifies it in Lactation Risk Category L3 (moderately safe).Possible side effects and cautionsSweat and urine smells like maple syrup; milk and/or breastfed baby may smell like maple syrup.Occasionally causes loose stools, which go away when fenugreek is discontinued.Use of more than 100 grams of fenugreek seeds daily can cause intestinal distress and nausea (recommended dose is less than 8 grams per day).Repeated external applications can result in undesirable skin reactions [Wichtl 1994].Ingestion of fenugreek seeds or tea in infants or late-term pregnant women can lead to false diagnosis of maple syrup urine disease in the infant due to presence of sotolone in the urine. See [Korman 2001] and other studies on fenugreek and maple syrup urine smell.Use with caution or avoid if you have a history of:Peanut or chickpea allergy: Fenugreek is in the same family with peanuts and chickpeas, and may cause an allergic reaction in moms who are allergic to these things. Two cases of fenugreek allergy have been reported in the literature. [Patil 1997, Ohnuma 1998, Lawrence 1999]Diabetes or hypoglycemia: Fenugreek reduces blood glucose levels, and in the few studies using it as a hypoglycemic, also reduces blood cholesterol. Dosages higher than the recommended one (given above) may result in hypoglycemia in some mothers [Heller]. If youre diabetic (IDDM), use fenugreek only if you have good control of your blood glucose levels. While taking this, closely monitor your fasting levels and post-prandial (after meals) levels. Mothers with hypoglycemia should also use fenugreek with caution. For more on fenugreek and glucose levels, see the references below.Asthma: Fenugreek is often cited as a natural remedy for asthma. However, inhalation of the powder can cause asthma and allergic symptoms. Some mothers have reported that it worsened their asthma symptoms. [Dugue 1993, Huggins, Lawrence 1999].Drug interactionsOral drugs or herbs taken at the same time as fenugreek may have delayed absorption due to the mucilage content of fenugreek. [Wichtl 1994]Glipizide and other antidiabetic drugsFenugreek reduces blood glucose levels and may enhance the effects of these drugs.InsulinFenugreek reduces blood glucose levels, so insulin dosage may need to be adjusted.Heparin, Warfarin and other anticoagulantsTiclopidine and other platelet inhibitorsThe fenugreek plant contains several coumarin compounds. Although studies have not shown any problems, it potentially could cause bleeding if combined with these types of drugs.MAOIsFenugreek contains amine and has the potential to augment the effect of these drugs.Drug Interaction References:[Wichtl 1994]Fenugreek drug interactions from HealthnotesFenugreek drug interactions from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer CenterFenugreek use during pregnancyMedicinal doses of fenugreek (not the amounts used in curries) are considered a uterine stimulant. Fenugreek has been used to aid and induce labor [Dehlvi, Bingel 1991] and is considered to be an emmenagogue [Turner]. For this reason, fenugreek use is not recommended during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy).Fenugreek is used as a morning sickness remedy in Chinese medicine. [Richmond]Use only in moderation during pregnancy. A uterine stimulant in high doses, but quite safe as a culinary herb or during labour. [Ody 1999]Motherlove Herbal lists fenugreek as a cleansing herb which is too strong or irritating to be used during pregnancy. [Motherlove]One study effectively used fenugreek as a source of fiber to control blood glucose and lipid levels of pregnant diabetic women. [Madar 1987]A stimulant effect on the isolated uterus (guinea pig) has been reported and its use in late pregnancy may not be advisable. [Hale 2002]Water and alcohol extracts of fenugreek are oxytocic. They stimulate contraction of uterine smooth muscles during the last period of pregnancy according to studies on isolated guinea pig uterus tissue. [Willard 1991]Fenugreek exerts an oxytocic effect in guinea pigs. Its use in humans has not been sufficiently studied, but could potentially lead to SAB or preterm labor and prematurity secondary to its oxytocic effects. Its use in pregnancy is not recommended. [Rice]Not recommended during pregnancy. [CommE, Brinker 1998, McGuffin 1997, MHO]Possible side effects for babyMost of the time, baby is unaffected by moms use of fenugreek (except that more milk may be available for baby). Sometimes baby will smell like maple syrup, too (just like mom). However, some moms have noticed that baby is fussy and/or has green, watery stools when mom is taking fenugreek and the symptoms go away when mom discontinues the fenugreek.Fenugreek can cause GI symptoms in mom (upset stomach, diarrhea), so its possible for it to cause GI symptoms in baby too. Also anyone can have an allergic reaction to any herb, and fenugreek allergy, though rare, has been documented.Another reason for these types of symptoms and perhaps more likely than a reaction to the herb may be that moms supply has increased due to the fenugreek and the symptoms are those of oversupply, where baby is getting too much foremilk. Fussiness, gas and green watery stools are classic symptoms of an overabundant milk supply.Some things to try:Stop the fenugreek (without switching to another herb). If you are taking fenugreek for low supply, and are having problems with oversupply when taking this herb, it may be questionable whether you needed to increase supply in the first place.If you are deliberately trying to maintain an oversupply (such as when youre pumping part/all of the time rather than nursing directly), then you might also try the following things:Cut back on the fenugreek dosage to see if babys symptoms disappear.Take measures to remedy the oversupply (help baby get more hindmilk) by doing things such as keeping baby to only one breast for up to 2-3 hours.Try non-pharmaceutical methods of increasing supply (this is always the first thing that should be tried), or talk to your health care provider and lactation consultant about trying a different herb. This should help if baby is reacting to the fenugreek in moms milk.The main question in this instance, however, is whether the fenugreek is needed at all. Many moms feel that their supply is low when it really isnt. See Increasing Low Milk Supply for more information.Where to get fenugreekFenugreek seed capsules, tinctures and teas can be purchased in many health food stores and online. You can also buy empty gelatin capsules and bulk fenugreek seed powder to make your own capsules.Fenugreek tea is a weak form of the herb. For the tea: use a teaspoon of whole fenugreek seeds. Steep in boiling water for 15 minutes or so.Fenugreek sprouts are another way to eat fenugreek. Fenugreek seeds can be obtained in the bulk food section of some health food stores, or you may be able to find them at a store that specializes in Indian or other eastern foods. Soak 1-2 teaspoons of the seeds in water overnight. Pour that water off the next day (or drink it  its fenugreek tea) and rinse seeds with clear water. Place the seeds into a sprouter (this can be as simple as a small, clear plastic clamshell carry-out container), and place on a windowsill or table with the lid slightly ajar. Rinse with water daily. The seeds will sprout in around five days.Fenugreek seeds for mastitis or engorgement: Steep several ounces of seeds in a cup or so of water. Let seeds cool, then mash them. Place on a clean cloth, warm, and use as a poultice or plaster on engorged or mastitic breasts to help with let-down and sore spots.Other uses for fenugreekFenugreek has been used traditionally to treat diabetes, coughs, congestion, bronchitis, fever, high blood pressure, headaches/migraines, diarrhea, flatulence, anaemia, irregular menstrual cycles and arthritis, to ease labor pains and menstruation pain, and as an appetite stimulant. Fenugreek has also been used as an external poultice to control inflammation and dandruff.There is current research being done on using fenugreek for diabetes, high cholesterol, inflammatory bowel disease and gastric ulcers.Other names for fenugreekOther names for fenugreekLatin:Trigonella foenum-graecum L.; Foenugraeci semen (for the seed)Amharic/Ethiopian:AbishItalian:Fieno GrecoArabic:Hulba,HilbehJapanese:KorohaChinese:Hu-lu-ba,Hu-lu-pa,Ku-TouNorwegian:BukkehonrklverDutch:FenegriekPortuguese:Alforva,Feno-grego Farsi:SambelilRussian:Pazhitnik,Pazhitnik grecheskiy,SambalaFinnish:SarviapilaSanskrit:Methi,Methika,Peetbeeja French:Fenugrec,Snegr,TrigonelleSpanish:Alholva,FenogrecoGerman:Bockshornsamen (seed),Bockshorklee,Griechisches HeuSwahili:UwatuHebrew:HilbehSwedish:BockshornkleeBockhornsklver Hungarian:GrgsznaTurkish:emenReferences:Fenugreek info from Samex AgencyFenugreek info from Gernot Katzers Spice PagesNutritional profile Nutritional Profile  Fenugreek Seed  Trigonella foenum-graecum (Leguminosae) calculated on a zero moisture basis per 100 gmAluminum35 mgCobalt0.182 mgMagnesium121 mgAsh(total)3.9 %Crude Fiber8.7 %Manganese0.21 mgCalcium73 mgDietary Fiber48.0 %Niacin1.60 mgCalories0.68 /gmFat6.4 %Phosphorus288 mgCarbohydrates59.1 %Iron5.6 mgPotassium102 mgChromium0.04 mgProtein30.6 %Tin0.42 mgThiamine1.35 mgSelenium0.16 mgSilicon0.47mgRiboflavin0.32 mgSodium58.0 mgVitamin A38.5 IUVitamin C60.0 mgZinc[trace mg]Nutrients of note: Sugars13 %(glucose, arabinose, galactose)Starch15 %References[Bingel 1991] Bingel AS, Farnsworth NR.

ABM News and Views 2000;6(3): Annual meeting abstracts Sept 11-13, 2000Background: Fenugreek is a popular herb used in the lay population as a galactogogue though scientific research regarding efficacy has not been published.Objective: To assess the effect of fenugreek on breast milk production in exclusively breast-pumping women.Methods: Ten women kept diaries of their breast milk production for two weeks. The first week established baseline milk production. During the second week three capsules of fenugreek seed were taken three times daily. This observational study used each patient as her own control in comparing breast milk production with and without the fenugreek.Results: Average daily pump volumes for week 1 and week 2 were compared. These values were statistically analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The average daily milk volume for week 1 was 207 ml compared to 464 for week 2. This increase was statistically significant (P=0.004)Conclusion: The use of fenugreek significantly increased volume of breastmilk produced. Further study of the herb and its effects on the lactating breast is certainly warranted. The use of fenugreek to improve lactation could offer help to women with insufficient supply.[Turkylmaz 2011] Turkylmaz C, Onal E, Hirfanoglu IM, Turan O, Ko E, Ergenekon E, Atalay Y.

Can a nursing mother eat this food? FAQs,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/mom-foods/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCIs there a list of foods that I should avoid while breastfeeding?Can nursing mothers eat strong-flavored or spicy foods?How will eating gassy foods affect baby?Can acidic foods that mom eats be too acid for baby?Will too many sweets or increasing/decreasing fat in my diet affect breastmilk?Can I drink soda (diet or regular)?Can I drink coffee or soda that contains caffeine?Can I eat/drink foods containing artificial sweeteners?Can a nursing mother eat honey?Can I eat foods containing MSG (monosodium glutamate)?Should I be avoiding certain kinds of fish?Can I eat sushi?Can a nursing mother eat unpasteurized soft cheeses?Is it safe to eat peanuts and peanut butter while nursing?What about alcoholic beverages?Is there a list of foods that I should avoid while breastfeeding?There are NO foods that a mother should avoid simply because she is breastfeeding. It is generally recommended that you eat whatever you like, whenever you like, in the amounts that you like and continue to do this unless you notice an obvious reaction in your baby to a particular food. There is no such thing as a LIST OF FOODS THAT BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS SHOULD NOT EAT because most nursing moms can eat anything they want, and because the babies who are sensitive to certain foods are each unique  what bothers one may not bother another. If you have a family history of allergies and think your baby might be allergic, you might want to avoid certain foods, but again, this would be different for every child.More information:How does moms diet affect her milk?My baby is gassy. Is this caused by something in my diet?Can nursing mothers eat strong-flavored or spicy foods?Yes, in general. There are many cultures who regularly eat spicy foods and strong-flavored foods, and there is no evidence that a greater percentage of these babies are fussy, gassy, or have other problems with the foods their moms eat. We do know that some strong flavors, like garlic, can pass into the milk but it does not seem to cause problems. In fact, one study showed that babies nursed better after mom ate garlic.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.How will eating gassy foods affect baby?It is common for nursing moms to be warned away from eating the so-called gassy foods such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, etc. However, gassy foods have no more potential to affect your baby than other foods.Eating certain foods may cause gas in mom due to the normal breakdown of some of the undigested carbohydrates (sugar, starches, soluble fiber) by bacteria in the large intestine (see Gas in the digestive tract).However, breastmilk is made from what passes into moms blood, not what is in her stomach or digestive track. Neither the gas nor the undigested carbohydrates (whose breakdown can cause gas in mom) pass into moms blood, so it is impossible for these things to pass into your milk to make your baby gassy.This is not saying that your baby will not have a sensitivity to a certain food, but a foods potential to affect baby really has nothing to do with whether it makes mom gassy.See also My baby is gassy. Is this caused by something in my diet? @ Can acidic foods that mom eats be too acid for baby?No. Acidic foods like citrus, tomatoes, etc. can not change the acidity of breastmilk. Like any other food, however, some babies will be sensitive to the proteins that pass into moms milk.Will too many sweets or increasing/decreasing fat in my diet affect breastmilk?No. Breastmilk is not affected by the amount of sugar that mom eats.In addition, the fat and calorie content of moms milk is not affected by her diet. However, the kinds of fats in the milk can be changed (to a certain extent) via diet.See also:What affects the amount of fat or calories in moms milk? @ Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight? @ How might I increase babys weight gain? @ Can I drink soda (diet or regular)?Soda generally contains carbonation (the part that makes it fizzy), caffeine and/or artificial sweeteners. See below for more information.Can I drink coffee or soda that contains caffeine?See Breastfeeding and Caffeine.Can I eat/drink foods containing artificial sweeteners?Nutrasweet (aspartame)According to Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk, 2012), Nutrasweet (aspartame) levels in mothers milk are too low to produce significant side effects in infants who do not have PKU (phenylketonuria). It IS contraindicated in babies with proven PKU. Hale lists aspartame in Lactation Risk Category L1 (safest), but L5 (contraindicated) if baby has PKU.Splenda (sucralose)According to Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk, 2012), there has been little research on sucralose in breastfeeding women. Per Hale, it is poorly absorbed from the GI tract and is excreted unchanged in the urine. The United States FDA considers sucralose to be safe for use in breastfeeding women. Hale lists sucralose in Lactation Risk Category L2 (safer).SorbitolSorbitol is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits and vegetables and is used as a sweetener in foods and medications. Its not listed in Hale, but is unlikely to be a problem breastfeeding-wise. Its commonly used in toothpaste, sugar-free chewing gum, etc.SaccharinPer Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk, 2012), milk levels of saccharin tend to accumulate over time, but still are considered minimal. Moderate intake should not be a problem for nursing mothers. Hale classifies it in Lactation Risk Category L3 (probably safe).Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana)Stevia is a very sweet herb that is used by many as a zero-calorie sugar substitute.Rebaudioside A (purified from Stevia rebaudiana) is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a sweetening agent for foods by the US Food and Drug Administration, but no studies have been done on pregnant or breastfeeding women. Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk, 2012) recommends caution when it comes to using stevia while breastfeeding because many different herbs in the same genus are being used as natural sweeteners, and because there are no studies on the use of stevia in breastfeeding women. He classifies stevia in Lactation Risk Category L3 (probably safe).More information:Safety of sucralose from the Splenda websiteArtificial sweeteners by William Sears, MD (general info, not breastfeeding related)Artificial sweetener info from Dr. Jay Gordon (general info, not breastfeeding related)Butchko HH, et al.

Am J Clin Nutr. 1998 Sep;68(3):531-7.Can a nursing mother eat honey?Honey is not a problem for mom to eat. The gut flora of adults and children over a year old are able to fend off the botulism spores that may be present in honey, and render them harmless. Since the spores would be killed in your gastrointestinal tract, they would not make it into your bloodstream and therefore cannot be present in your milk.A babys gut cant defend itself against the botulism spores, and so they can colonize the intestinal tract, germinate and release botulinum neurotoxin. As a result, honey is not recommended for babies under a year old. Its recommended that you avoid giving baby anything that contains honey, or make sure that the cooking process kills any botulism spores that might be present. Botulism spores are very heat resistant  the toxin is less resistant.More information:Tanzi MG, Gabay MP. Association between honey consumption and infant botulism.

Breastmilk levels are only modestly affected by moms ingestion of MSG.

[See Table 7: Food and Environmental Agents: Effects on Breastfeeding.]General information:MSG: A Common Flavor Enhancer by Michelle Meadows, from FDA Consumer magazine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, January-February 2003Everything You Need To Know About Glutamate And Monosodium Glutamate from the International Food Information Council Foundation, January 1997Should I be avoiding certain kinds of fish?Due to the risk of too-high levels of methylmercury affecting an unborn child, the US Food & Drug Administration advises pregnant women to avoid eating several types of fish: shark, swordfish, king mackeral and tilefish (these are longer-lived, larger fish that feed on other fish and are thus more likely to accumulate higher levels of mercury). Per the FDA, While it is true that the primary danger from methylmercury in fish is to the developing nervous system of the unborn child, it is prudent for nursing mothers and young children not to eat these fish as well. They recommend that your consumption of other kinds of fish (shellfish, canned fish, smaller ocean fish or farm-raised fish) average no more than 12 ounces per week.Others recommend that the FDA list of unsafe fish be expanded. See Mercury In Your Fish by Ken Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group, for additional information and suggested lists of safe and unsafe fish during pregnancy.What about tuna? Per the FDA, you can safely include tuna as part of your weekly fish consumption. The varieties of fish that the FDA does suggest we avoid contain methylmercury in amounts ranging from 0.96-1.45 PPM (parts per million). Fresh tuna averages 0.32 PPM and canned tuna averages 0.17 PPM. Tuna steaks and canned albacore tuna generally contain higher levels of mercury than canned light tuna. On the other hand, the Environmental Working Group suggests that pregnant mothers avoid eating tuna steak altogether, and eat canned tuna no more often than once a month.References and additional information:Breastfeeding and Mercury Exposure @ Fish: What Pregnant Women and Parents Should KnowUS Food & Drug Administration.What You Need to Know About Mercury in Fish and Shellfish: Advice For Women Who Might Become Pregnant, Women Who Are Pregnant, Nursing Mothers, Young Children .

Lists various varieties of fish and seafood along with methylmercury levels in each.Environmental contaminants and breastfeeding @ Can I eat sushi?Yes; just make certain that you are comfortable with the source and care of the raw fish (reputable sushi bars are very careful about this). Like any raw food, sushi can carry carry parasites or a bacteria called listeria monocytogenes (see below for more on listeriosis), and some species of fish should be avoided due to mercury levels. The consensus among breastfeeding experts seems to be that eating raw-fish-sushi doesnt pose a problem for a breastfeeding baby (though it has the potential to make mom sick).Can a nursing mother eat unpasteurized soft cheeses?Yes, nursing mothers can eat soft cheeses. Unpasteurized soft cheeses (and other unpasteurized dairy products) can carry a bacteria called listeria monocytogenes. Cheese made in the United States must be made from pasteurized milk (pasteurization kills the listeria organism), but imported cheeses may be a problem. Listeriosis is usually a minor flu-like illness in healthy adults, but can cause serious problems for pregnant women and may be linked to stillbirth and miscarriage (as it can be passed to baby via the placenta). Although eating unpasteurized dairy products is not recommended during pregnancy, it is not considered a problem for nursing moms.Per Lawrence (Breastfeeding: A guide for the medical profession 1999, p 569), No evidence in the literature suggests transmission of Listeria through breastmilk. This reference indicates that the only thing that might interfere with breastfeeding is a mothers inability to nurse due to severe illness.Other foods that can carry listeria that are considered safe for nursing moms (but not during pregnancy):hot dogs, luncheon meats, bologna, or other deli meats unless they are reheated until steaming hotsoft cheese such as Feta, queso blanco, queso fresco, Brie, Camembert cheeses, blue-veined cheeses, and Panela unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk. Make sure the label says, MADE WITH PASTEURIZED MILK.refrigerated pt, meat spreads from a meat counter, or smoked seafood found in the refrigerated section of the store. Foods that dont need refrigeration, like canned tuna and canned salmon, are okay to eat. Refrigerate after opening.salads made in the store such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, or seafood saladraw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that have unpasteurized milk in themSource: Protect Your Baby and Yourself From ListeriosisMore information:Listeriosis information from the US Centers for Disease ControlIs it safe to eat peanuts and peanut butter while nursing?Current research indicates that avoiding peanuts during pregnancy or breastfeeding does not help to prevent peanut allergies in your child.Until recently, allergists recommended that children not get peanuts or peanut products until at least 36 months old, but recent studies tell us that this delay does not help to prevent peanut allergies..More information:Peanut allergies, children and pregnancy from the March of DimesGreer FR, Sicherer SH, Burks AW; American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition; American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Allergy and Immunology.

Herbal weight loss products and breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/mom-herbalweightloss/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCMany herbal weight loss products contain some form of ephedra. It might be listed in the ingredients as Ma Huang, Ephedra sinica, Sida cordifolia, ephedra, ephedrine group alkaloids, ephedrine, etc. Some of the weight loss products that have contained ephedra include Metabolife, Herbalife, OmniTrim, Trim Easy, Diet Pep, MetaboSafe, geniCiL, AM-300, power drinks like Ultimate Orange, etc.I strongly urge you to avoid any products containing ephedra, whether or not you are nursing, as this can be quite dangerous. It is a natural treatment for asthma, but can cause a variety of heart-related problems including heart attack and death. Young people who didnt know that they had underlying health problems have died with doses as low as 36 mg of ephedra. The FDA and Health Canada have issued several alerts regarding ephedrine-containing dietary supplements, and ephedra will be banned in the US in early 2004. Per Hale, there are no data available on how much ephedrine is secreted in human milk, however small amounts of a related drug (d-isoephedrine) is believed to be secreted into breastmilk.Another caution with regard to herbal weight loss products  most of these products contain a combination of different herbs. If your baby is sensitive to one or more of these herbs, it would be very difficult to determine which is the problem.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Following are some of the other herbs commonly used in weight loss products:Other stimulants  Ginseng, Caffeine (Guarana/Paullinea cupana, Kola Nut/Cola nitida, Yerba mat, Green Tea), Citrus Aurantium (Bitter Orange). Stimulants can affect babys sleep and feeding, and some may be dangerous to mom and/or baby.5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) is not recommended for nursing mothers as it could affect your infants neurological development and/or suppress lactation.Chitosan is a fiber-like material from the shells of shellfish such as shrimp and crabs. There is no evidence that it aids weight loss, and it has the potential for serious allergic reaction in those allergic to shellfish.Chromium Picolinate is a form of chromium. There is no evidence that it is effective for weight loss.

Low carb diets and breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/mom-lowcarb/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCHigh protein, low carbohydrate diets like the Atkins diet and the South Beach diet are very popular. These diets can be helpful for diabetics and people with gluten intolerance. In these diets, protein and high fat foods are not restricted; vegetables are limited. The main difference between Atkins and South Beach seems to be that the South Beach diet is less structured and emphasizes eating healthier, mostly unsaturated fats.The primary objections Ive seen to these and similar diets  and this applies to everyone, not just nursing mothers  is simply the fact that they are not balanced and thus have the potential to make you feel unwell. These diets tend to be low in phytochemicals, antioxidants and folic acid. They also tend to be low in fiber and minerals (including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus & potassium), and the Atkins diet may be high in saturated fats. Because of this, long-term adherence to these diets may increase your risk for various health problems. Since some of the weight loss from these diets is simply due to water loss, dehydration is a risk if the dieter is not careful to drink plenty of water.Some moms have found that very low carb diets decrease milk supply. Going off the diet generally brings milk volume right back up again.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.This decrease in milk supply may be due to several factors:Dehydration.The sudden decrease in calories when mom goes on the diet. If a woman is used to a certain level of calories, an abrupt drop due to dieting (or illness) may reduce her milk supply. This sudden decrease in calories can tell moms body that she is in starvation mode and to conserve on all fronts (thus less of her bodys resources go into making milk).Insufficient caloric intake. With a low carb diet, many people are not nearly as hungry  so even if you are eating to hunger, you may not be taking in enough calories to sustain a good milk supply (recommended 1800+ calories per day for the average nursing mother). Food records indicate that people following the Atkins diet self-restrict their caloric intake to less than 1700 calories per day.Some tips for moms who wish to try a low-carb diet:Wait until baby is at least 2 months old before dieting; waiting until after baby starts solids (6+ months) should be even better.Drink enough water to avoid dehydration.Avoid a sudden decrease in caloric intake. Start gradually.Keep an eye on your caloric intake. Most moms should avoid dropping below 1800 calories per day.Most sources recommend that nursing mothers avoid Phase I of the diet, and instead start with Phase II.Watch for a diminished milk supply. Keep an eye on babys diaper output and weight gain.More on low-carb and other dietsCan I diet while breastfeeding? @ Low Carbohydrate Diets and the Breastfeeding Mother La Leche League FAQBooksEat Well,Lose WeightWhile Breastfeedingby Eileen Behan, RDFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Can I diet while breastfeeding?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/mom-weightloss/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCSix guidelines for safe dieting during lactationWhat might happen if a nursing mother loses weight too quickly?Three great tips for weight loss (whether you are nursing or not)Specific weight loss methodsWeight Watchers, Body for LifeSouth Beach Diet, Atkins DietHerbal weight loss productsAdditional informationYes! Nursing mothers can lose weight safely if they follow some basic guidelines.Six guidelines for safe dieting during lactationWait until your baby is two months old before dietingIts best not to do anything consciously to lose weight until after the second month. This gives your body enough time to successfully establish a healthy milk supply that is less likely to be adversely affected if your caloric intake is restricted. Breastfeeding your baby, on average, burns 200-500 calories per day (above what you needed to maintain your pre-pregnancy weight)  so keep in mind that even without a weight loss program you are burning extra calories.Breastfeed without restrictionResearch tells us that both more frequent breastfeeding and breastfeeding longer than six months increases maternal weight loss.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Eat at least 1500-1800 calories per dayWhile nursing, you should not consume less than 1500-1800 calories per day, and most women should stay at the high end of this range. Some mothers will require much more than this, but studies show that going below this number may put supply at risk.Keep weight loss at less than 1.5 pounds per weekMost moms can safely lose up to 1.5 pounds per week or 6 pounds per month after the second month and not affect milk supply or babys well being. One study has suggested that short-term weight loss of 2.2 pounds (1 kg) per week is not a problem (in this study, moms dieted for 11 days).Decrease the calories graduallyA sudden drop in calories can reduce milk supply. Some moms notice this during an illness, although dehydration and/or medication use could also be a factor in reduced milk supply when mom is sick. It has been hypothesized that a sudden calorie decrease can cause moms body to go into starvation mode and cut nonessential resources such as milk production.Avoid quick-fix solutionsLiquid diets, low-carb diets, fad diets, weight loss medication, etc. are not recommended while breastfeeding.What might happen if a nursing mother loses weight too quickly?In most instances of too-rapid weight loss, it is not the breastmilk (composition or supply) that would suffer, but moms nutrition and/or health.Excessive dieting can result in a reduced milk supply.According to Breastfeeding and Human Lactation (3rd Edition, Riordan, pp 440), it is noted that fad or rapid weight loss programs should be avoided because fat-soluble environmental contaminants and toxins stored in body fat are released into the milk when caloric intake is severely restricted. I was unable to find a definition of severely restricted but I expect that it is significantly under 1500 calories per day (which they called a modest intake). Ive included information on a study on this subject below. See also the info at this website regarding environmental contaminants and breastfeeding.Three great tips for weight loss (whether you are nursing or not)Make dietary changes  decrease your fat intake to 20-25% or less of total calories; keep your protein intake up to prevent loss of muscle mass (Recommended Intake of protein for nursing mothers is 65 grams/day for the first 6 months and 62 grams/day between 6 and 12 months).Spread your calorie intake out  instead of 2-3 meals, eat 3 smaller meals with snacks between. Your body will be less likely to go into starvation mode if you are eating small amounts throughout the day.Exercise moderately so that you burn more fat while keeping lean muscle mass. Resistance/weight training is a good way to build muscle mass. A person with more muscle mass burns more calories, even when resting.Specific weight loss methodsWeight Watchers, Body for LifeWeight Watchers and Body for Life are generally considered to be fine for breastfeeding mothers. Weight Watchers has a program specifically aimed at nursing mothers. As always, avoid cutting calories too abruptly or losing weight too quickly.South Beach Diet, Atkins DietSee Low carb diets and breastfeeding.Herbal weight loss productsSee Herbal weight loss products and breastfeeding.Additional information@ Low carb diets and breastfeedingHerbal weight loss products and breastfeedingDo nursing mothers need extra calories or fluids?Can I continue to breastfeed if I work out/exercise?Religious Fasting and BreastfeedingHow does moms diet affect her milk?Do I need to take vitamins?Can my diet affect the amount of fat or calories in my milk?Can a nursing mother eat this food?@ other websitesNutrition, Exercise, and Weight Loss While Breastfeeding by Anne Smith, IBCLCWeight loss for Nursing Moms by Paula YountWeight Loss After Pregnancy by Dr. Jay GordonLosing Weight while Breastfeeding La Leche League FAQQ&As by Kathy Kuhn, IBCLC & Debbi Donovan, IBCLCNutrition Analysis Tool (NAT) from the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department at the University of IllinoisHammer RL and Hinterman C.

Randomized trial of the short-term effects of dieting compared with dieting plus aerobic exercise on lactation performance (link is to full article). Am J Clin Nutr 1999 May;69(5):959-67. This study found that short-term weight loss (approximately 1 kg/2.2 pounds per week) through a combination of dieting and aerobic exercise appears safe for breast-feeding mothers and is preferable to weight loss achieved primarily by dieting because the latter reduces maternal lean body mass. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.Dewey KG. Effects of maternal caloric restriction and exercise during lactation (link is to full article). J Nutr 1998 Feb;128(2 Suppl):386S-389S. Studies suggest that, for women who are not underweight initially, lactation is not adversely affected by moderate rates of weight loss (no more than 2 kg/4.4 pounds per month) achieved by either caloric restriction or exercise. A short period of more rapid weight loss is not harmful to lactation. It is unknown, however, whether there are risks associated with longer periods of rapid weight loss.Journal search on dieting and exercise during lactationFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Vegetarian Diets and Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/mothers-diet/vegetarian/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCA vegetarian or vegan mother does not need to take any special dietary precautions as long as she is maintaining a diet with adequate amounts of vitamin B12, calcium and zinc. This is something that mom needs to do for herself, even if she is not breastfeeding.If you are avoiding meat but eating any other type of animal protein (eggs, milk, cheese or other dairy products, fish, poultry) you will normally get enough vitamin B12.If, on the other hand, you are consuming no animal protein at all  no fish, meat, poultry, eggs or dairy products  you will need to make sure you get enough vitamin B12 to prevent your baby (and you) from becoming deficient in this vitamin. Vitamin B12 supplements and vitamin B12 fortified foods are available. Supplementing your baby with vitamin B12 is an option if you are vitamin B12 deficient, but you would still need the vitamin B12 for yourself (and if youre getting enough, baby wont need the supplement).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.If you dont eat dairy products, check to make sure that youre getting sufficient calcium and zinc (this is for your health  baby will get enough of these minerals through your milk even if your diet is deficient). Pregnant and breastfeeding mothers do not need more calcium than normally required for their age group the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for calcium for women aged 19-50 is 1000 mg per day. The DRI for zinc for breastfeeding mothers is 12 mg per day.Additional information @ Moms Diet Vitamin B12CalciumVitamin DVitaminsRaising a vegetarian baby (links)@ other websitesBreastfeeding While Vegan byAnayah [link has been updated]The Vegetarian Breastfeeding Mother by Mel Wolk, from Leaven, Vol. 33 No. 3, June-July 1997, p. 69.The Vegan Diet During Pregnancy and Lactation by Reed Mangels, Ph.D., RD.Iron in the Vegan Diet by Reed Mangels, Ph.D., R.D.Mangels AR, Messina V.

Guidelines for offering juice to babies,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/baby-juice/,"Juice is in the same category as solid foods. Babies need nothing other than breastmilk for the first six months (except in rare cases).For babies under six monthsBabies under six months should not be given juice.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition, There is no nutritional indication to feed juice to infants younger than 6 months. Offering juice before solid foods are introduced into the diet could risk having juice replace breast milk or infant formula in the diet.The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding notes: During the first 6 months of age, even in hot climates, water and juice are unnecessary for breastfed infants and may introduce contaminants or allergens.According to the Australian Governments National Health and Medical Research Council, Fruit juice is not necessary or recommended for infants under 12 months of age.For babies over six monthsSome authorities do not recommend juice at all for babies under 12 months old.Juice intake, like water intake, can interfere with breastfeeding because it fills baby up so that he nurses less.Juice should be introduced just like any other new food. For example, applesauce and apple juice should be introduced separately.Offer the juice from a cup rather than a bottle. Offering it only with meals will help to reduce the risk of tooth decay.Dilute the juice (the UKs NHS recommends one part juice to 10 parts water), or try using juice just to flavor water.If you do offer juice, limit babys intake to no more than 3-4 ounces total per day so that baby is not filling up on it to the extent that he has no appetite for other foods.In their Infant Feeding Guidelines, The Australian Governments National Health and Medical Research Council says that Fruit juice is not necessary or recommended for infants under 12 months of age. Sweetened drinks are associated with dental caries. Tea, herbal teas and other drinks are of no known benefit to an infant and could possibly be harmful.Health Canada also does not recommend juice in the first year. After 12 months, they advise to Limit fruit juiceand do not offer sweetened beverages. If your child seems thirsty, offer water.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.In the UK, the NHS advises, Babies under six months oldshouldntbe givenfruit juices.Diluted fruit juice (one part juice to 10 parts water) can be given to children with their meals after six months.The American Academy of Pediatricspolicy statementrecommends that babies younger than 6 months should not be givenanyjuice, children aged 6 months to 6 years should get no more than 4-6 ounces per day, and children older than 7 should have no more than 8-12 ounces of juice daily.The potential hazards of too much juiceDrinking too much juice can lead to malnutrition or anemia, as a child is missing out on other necessary nutrients, including proteins and complex carbohydrates.Drinking a lot of juice can damage the enamel of the teeth, leading to tooth decay. This is particularly a problem when the juice is offered in a bottle, rather than a cup.Drinking a lot of juice, especially apple juice, may cause loose bowel movements and constant diarrhea.Consumption of greater than 12 fl oz/day of fruit juice by young children has been associated with short stature and obesity (see studies by Dennison et al); other studies did not observe this association (see studies by Skinner et al). Consumption of more than 12 fl oz/day of fruit juice has also been associated with nonorganic failure to thrive (Smith et al, 1994).Fruit juices that contain sorbitol or high levels of fructose as sweeteners may cause restlessness, gas and stomach distress in infants (Cole et al, 1999). The sweeteners may cause problems in babies because young children often have difficulty breaking down carbohydrates, including these sugars.Unpasteurized juice may contain harmful bacteria, such as E-coli and Salmonella.ReferencesInfant Feeding Guidelines from the Australian GovernmentsNational Health and Medical Research Council.Infant Nutrition from the Government of Canada.Drinks and Cups for Childrenfrom the National Health Service Website (UK).American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Nutrition.

Guidelines for offering water to breastfed babies,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/baby-water/,"Image courtesy of Spigoo / flickr.comExclusively breastfed babies do not need additional water  breastmilk is 88% water and supplies all the fluids that your baby needs. Even in the first few days after birth, before moms milk has come in, colostrum is all that is needed to keep baby well hydrated (assuming baby is nursing effectively).Exclusively breastfed babies do not require additional water even when it is very hot outside, as long as baby is allowed to nurse as needed. Even in extremely hot, dry weather your baby can get all the liquids needed via breastmilk. A number of research studies investigating the need for water in exclusively breastfed babies were done in various locations (both humid and dry) at temperatures ranging from 22-41C (71.6-105.8F) and 9-96% relative humidity [see references below]; these studies concluded that exclusive breastfeeding provides all the fluids needed.Formula fed babies also do not routinely need extra water. Some sources do suggest offering water to a formula fed baby when it is very hot outside (though baby may prefer to get extra water from more frequent feeding), or when baby is sick with a fever (consult babys doctor for guidelines).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine advises, Supplementation in the first few days interferes with the normal frequency of breastfeedings. If the supplement is water or glucose water, the infant is at increased risk for increased bilirubin, excess weight loss, longer hospital stay, and potential water intoxication. Per the American Academy of Pediatrics, Supplements (water, glucose water, formula, and other fluids) should not be given to breastfeeding newborn infants unless ordered by a physician when a medical indication exists During the first 6 months of age, even in hot climates, water and juice are unnecessary for breastfed infants and may introduce contaminants or allergens.For newborns (especially under 4-5 weeks), water supplements can be riskyBabies under two months should not be given supplemental water.Water supplements are associated with increased bilirubin levels (jaundice), excess weight loss, and longer hospital stays for newborns.Too much water can lead to a serious condition called oral water intoxication.Water supplements fill baby up without adding calories, so water supplements can result in weight loss (or insufficient weight gain) for the baby.Babies who get water supplements are less interested in nursing. If baby is not nursing as often as he should, it will take longer for moms milk to come in and can delay or prevent mom from establishing an optimum milk supply.For babies past the newborn stageToo much water can interfere with breastfeeding because it fills baby up so that he nurses less. Babies need the nutrition and calories in breastmilk to grow  water has none of these.Breastmilk has all the water your baby needs, even in very hot weather.When your 4-6 month old baby is learning to use a cup, giving him a few sips of water a couple of times a day (no more than 2 ounces per 24 hours) is fine and fun.Once baby starts solids, you might want to give him a few sips of expressed milk or water with his solids  some babies need this to prevent constipation.For older babies & toddlers, continue to breastfeed and offer water in moderation. Breastmilk supplies plenty of fluids, so many older babies or toddlers who breastfeed without restriction can get the fluids they need through breastfeeding. Others may need a little water with solids to prevent constipation. No need for a bottle  just offer a cup. Most older babies and toddlers particularly like to drink water from a parents cup or straw. In our family, we usually offer a cup of water at mealtime, or when someone else is getting a drink, and let the child choose whether or not to drink.Additional informationGuidelines for offering juice to babies at KellyMomDo breastfeeding mothers need extra calories or fluids? at KellyMomExclusive Breastfeeding: The Only Water Source Young Infants Need FAQ Sheet No. 5 from the Linkages ProjectDo Breastfed Babies Need Water? by Anne Smith, IBCLCBeat the Heat: Summertime Suckling by Teresa PitmanAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding.

Finger Foods,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/finger-foods/,"Older babies who are just starting solids may prefer chunkier finger foods, instead of mashed or moistened food. The baby who starts solids at 6 months or older doesnt need pureed or liquefied foods. You may want to just start with finger foods, and let her mostly feed herself.How chunky can the food be? If your baby is not gagging & choking on the food, then the texture (table foods, etc.) is fine. Watch carefully the first few times your baby tries a new food to make sure she can handle it without gagging or choking. Always supervise your child when she is eating finger foods.Suggestions for finger foods:cubed soft foodsgrated or scraped apple, pear, carrotssmall pieces of ripe banana or avocadosliced kiwicooked carrots/peas/green beanscubed cooked yams, sweet or white potatoesunsweetened dry breakfast cereals (cheerios, etc.)slivers or finely chopped pieces of meat that has been softened with broth or warm watercubes, strings, or small pieces of cheesecooked pasta in shapes and colors sprinkled with some parmesan cheesewhole-grain bread stripspieces of toast or crackersdry waffles baby can carry aroundfrozen blueberries, peas, or corn right out of the package (great for relieving teething pain, but  not appropriate for most babies under a year due to the choking hazard. See below warning.)Warning: Steer clear of finger foods (including nuts and dried fruits) that may be choking hazards.

How do we get started with solids?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/solids-how/,"Watch your baby, not the calendar!Should solids replace breastmilk?How often and how much?Should I offer solids before or after nursing?What if my baby refuses all or most solids?Links: Starting Solid FoodsWatch your baby, not the calendar!If baby refuses solids, try again later (maybe a week or two), and maybe with a different food. Some babies may refuse solids until 8-9 months or even longer.Should solids replace breastmilk?No. Solids during the first year are only meant to complement breastmilk, not take precedence over it or replace any breastfeedings. It is more of a way to add textures to the babys diet, to allow the baby new experiences, and to help her develop hand/eye coordination through finger feeding. Your baby should still be allowed to nurse on demand, as your milk should be her primary source of nutrition until closer to the end of the first year. Continuing to allow on-demand feedings also better ensures your milk supply.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.How often and how much?Introduce your baby gradually to solid foods. Once she accepts them (it might take some time), continue breastfeeding as often as before and add solids as your babys appetite increases. A few bites once a day is enough in the beginning, but gradually increase. Following are some general guidelines  if baby starts solids later than six months, then proceed in a similar manner, at babys pace.SolidsLiquids0  4 monthsBreastmilk onlyBreastmilk only4  6 monthsBreastmilk onlySee also: What if my 4-5 month old seems developmentally ready for solids?Continue nursing on cue.When your 4  6 month old baby is learning to use a cup, giving him a few sips of expressed breastmilk or water (no more than 2 ounces per 24 hours) a couple of times a day is fine and fun.6  7 monthsOffer solids once a day, at most. Many start out offering solids every few days or even less often.Continue nursing on cue. Solid foods should not replace nursing sessions unless youre actively weaning.Limit water to SIPS from a cup with meals.Juice is not necessary for babys nutrition. If you offer juice, limit to sips from a cup with meals and introduce it gradually just like any other new food. Its best to dilute juice with water and limit total juice intake to no more than 3-4 ounces a day.7  9 monthsWatch babys cues  this is particularly easy if baby nurses beforehand and most/all of the solids are offered to baby to self-feed. Increase solids gradually if baby is interested, with a maximum of 2 meals per day.9  12 monthsWatch babys cues  this is particularly easy if baby nurses beforehand and most/all of the solids are offered to baby to self-feed. Increase solids gradually if baby is interested. Aim for baby getting no more than 25% of her calories from solids by the age of 12 months (some babies eat less than this at 12 months and thats also normal).If your baby is younger than a year (and you are not weaning), make sure that you always nurse before offering solids. Babies who start solids early, and babies who eat a lot of solids tend to wean earlier.It often works well to offer the solids about an hour after you nurse. If nursing has come before the solids you can continue feeding your baby the solids until she shows signs of fullness; i.e. turning her head, closing her mouth, batting at the spoon, wanting down, spitting the food out, etc. (trying to feed past this point is overfeeding). Most babies will balance their milk intake with their solid food intake well if you feed in this way.For babies older than a year, see Nutrition for Nursing Toddlers.There is no exact science to introducing solids. Just do your best to follow your babys cues about when to increase the amount of solids, and take care to ensure that breastmilk remains babys primary source of nutrition for the first year.Should I offer solids before or after nursing?What were aiming for during the first year is to have solids complementing breastmilk, not replacing it. This means that when solids are introduced the breastfeeding pattern is not interrupted at all, but baby is fed solids in slowly increasing amounts as his appetite increases. Baby will be getting about the same amount of breastmilk as he gets older, with increasing amounts of solids on top of that.I think the main point in the matter is maintaining breastmilk as babys main source of nutrition throughout the first year. This is important both to babys good nutrition and good health. The nutrients in breastmilk are particularly important for growth and development during babys first year. In addition, some (but certainly not all) of the health benefits of breastfeeding are directly related to the degree of exclusivity of breastfeeding (the greater the percentage of babys diet made up of breastmilk, the greater the health benefit).Nursing before (rather than after) the solids is a good way to help keep the transition to solids proceeding slowly so that moms milk supply is maintained and baby gets the breastmilk that he needs.See also Sustained Breastfeeding, Complementation and Care by Ted Greiner, Ph.D.Some reasons to nurse first: Too many solids too early often leads to early weaning, whether or not mom intended to wean early. Giving baby solids first (depending upon how often, how much, etc.) could start you down this road.Many babies, if they eat solids first, will take in less milk afterwards even if they nurse just as long.If you nurse first you dont really have to worry if youre giving baby too many solids  you can just go ahead and let her have as much as she wants.On the other hand, feeding solids before nursing might work very well for you if: Youre making sure that nursing stays primary by limiting amounts & frequency of solids and increasing both very gradually.Youre planning on weaning early (between 6 and 12 months) or are already in the process of weaningWhat if my baby refuses all or most solids?A lot of babies are slow to take to solids. Its not uncommon for some babies to take several months once solids have been introduced before they really take to them well. Babies who are slow to teethe and babies who have food sensitivities are often the ones who are slower to begin eating solids. This slowness may be their bodies way of protecting them until the digestive system is more ready to accept new foods.Rest assured that as long as your baby is continuing to gain weight and grow as she should, your milk is meeting her needs well. Solids during the first year should only *complement* your milk anyway. Your milk should still be the primary source of nutrition for most of the first year.All you need to do is to continue to *offer* foods. Dont worry if shes not interested or takes very small amounts. Your only true responsibility is what you offer and when you offer it, not whether or not baby eats it. That has to be up to her. Trying to force, coax, cajole, etc. her into eating is never recommended.Some babies prefer to eat foods that they can pick up and feed themselves, rather than foods that must be spooned to them. A lot of babies, also, would rather have food right off the table than the blander-tasting baby foods. Try offering your baby a variety of finger foods (see below) during family mealtime.You may also find that its helpful to make finger foods readily available throughout the day, so that baby can graze often. Some parents keep a variety of foods out in an ice cube or muffin tray. Small children often need to take in several smaller snacks throughout the day rather than eating 3 large meals.Its best to follow your babys cues to determine how muchand how often she wants to eat solid foods.See also:Guidelines for implementing a baby-led approach to the introduction of solid foodsfrom the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative (abstract)Guidelines for implementing a baby-led approach to the introduction of solid foods by Gill Rapley, adapted by Stefan KleintjesFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Will giving formula or solids at night help baby to sleep better?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/solids-sleep/,"The idea that solids will help your baby sleep is an old wives tale that has been disproven by medical studies. Feeding your baby solids or formula in an attempt to make baby sleep longer is not a good idea for several reasons:1. Thereis no evidence that it will help. Some babies will sleep worse, due to reactions to the formula or solids (tummy ache, etc. are not uncommon), particularly if baby is younger than around 6 months. Threestudies have indicated that adding solids or formula to the diet does not cause babies to sleep longer. These studies found no difference in the sleep patterns of babies who received solids before bedtime when compared to babies who were not given solids. Here are the studies:Brown A&Harries V. Infant Sleep and Night Feeding Patterns During Later Infancy: Association with Breastfeeding Frequency, Daytime Complementary Food Intake, and Infant Weight. Breastfeeding Medicine.

Do solids help baby sleep through the night? Am J Dis Child 1988; 142: 404-05.2. Formula requires a babys digestive system to work overtime as baby tries to digest something not specific to the human body. Formula is harder to digest than human milk; thus formula-fed babies tend to go longer between feedings (see this page for more on this subject). While this may seem like a benefit, its probably not something we want for our babies bodies unless there are no other alternatives. There are also risks to formula use (see What should I know about infant formula?). It certainly has a place in infant feeding but probably shouldnt be used whenever moms milk  either directly from the source or expressed  is available.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.3. Early introduction of solids (before six months) carries its own set of risks.4. Recent research suggests that longer stretches of deep sleep are associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and babies who sleep longer/deeper may be more vulnerable to SIDS (see in particular the research of James McKenna, PhD). Some scientists are saying that it appears that long sleep stretches are not natural for human infants and that sleep interruptions in the early months may provide a protective factor against SIDS. More research is needed on this subject, but parents might want to think twice about significantly manipulating babys natural sleep pattern in the early months.A little more about feeding baby cereal from a bottleDoctors and other experts recommend that you never give baby cereal in a bottle unless recommended by babys doctor for a specific medical condition. Here are some of their reasons:It is a choking hazard.The cereal takes away from the amount of milk in the bottle (adds carbohydrates and dilutes the nutrient density), and baby may not get adequate milk volume for proper growth and development.Baby is being given a higher concentration of calories without being able to regulate her own intake. This can lead to weight problems in the future.If babys doctor suggests thickened feedings for reflux, consider asking about alternatives, as many doctors question this practice and it has the potential to cause more harm than good.Additional informationI have heard different reviews about putting cereal in the bottle of an infant.

Is baby ready for solid foods? (Developmental signs of readiness),http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/solids-when/,"What do the experts say?Health experts and breastfeeding experts agree that its best to wait until your baby is around six months old before offering solid foods. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization, and many other health organizations recommend that babies be exclusively breastfed (no cereal, juice or other foods) for the first 6 months of life. Im not going into the many health benefits of delaying solids here; see When Should Baby Start Solids? for more information.Developmental signs that baby is ready for solidsSolids readiness depends on both the maturity of babys digestive tract and babys developmental readiness for solids. Although the maturity of babys digestive system is not something that we can readily observe, research indicates that 6 months appears to be ideal for avoiding increased illness and other health risks of too-early solids. After this point, different babies are ready for solids at different times  developmental readiness for solids cannot be determined using a calendar. Most babies are developmentally ready for solids somewhere between 6 and 8 months.Signs that indicate baby is developmentally ready for solids include:Baby can sit up well without support.Baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex and does not automatically push solids out of his mouth with his tongue.Baby is ready and willing to chew.Baby is developing a pincer grasp, where he picks up food or other objects between thumb and forefinger. Using the fingers and scraping the food into the palm of the hand (palmar grasp) does not substitute for pincer grasp development.Baby is eager to participate in mealtime and may try to grab food and put it in his mouth.We often state that a sign of solids readiness is when baby exhibits a long-term increased demand to breastfeed (sometime around 6 months or later) that is unrelated to illness, teething pain, a change in routine or a growth spurt. However, it can be hard to judge whether babys increased breastfeeding is related to readiness for solids. Many 6-month-old babies are teething, growth spurting, beginning to experience separation anxiety, and experiencing many other developmental changes that can lead to increased breastfeeding  sometimes all at once! Make sure you look at all the signs of solids readiness as a whole, because increased breastfeeding alone is not likely to be an accurate guide to babys readiness.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.More on developmental readinessIn April 2001, a literature review of the developmental readiness of normal full term infants to progress from exclusive breastfeeding to the introduction of complementary foods was jointly published by Wellstart International and the LINKAGES Project. Per the authors, The review does not focus on health outcomes associated with discontinuing exclusive breastfeeding at a particular age but rather on the biologic/developmental readiness for this complex experience. Four processes or functions were selected for inclusion: gastrointestinal, immunologic, oral motor and the maternal reproductive processes that relate to the continuation of lactation and the provision of breastmilk.Following are some of the conclusions of this review:Thus, exclusive breastfeeding to about six months allows the infant to have greater immunologic protection and limit the exposure to pathogens at a vulnerable age. This in turn permits the energy and nutrients that might otherwise be diverted to provide for immunologic responses to be available and utilized for other growth and developmental processes.These clinical reports indicate that the majority of normal full term infants are not developmentally ready for the transition from suckling to sucking or for managing semi-solids and solid foods in addition to liquids until between 6 and 8 months of age.Using this available information on the development of oral motor function, maternal reproductive physiology and development of the infants immunologic and gastrointestinal function, the expert review team concluded that the probable age of readiness for most full term infants to discontinue exclusive breastfeeding and begin complementary foods appears to be near six months or perhaps a little beyond. The also felt that there is probable convergence of such readiness across the several relevant processes.The consensus opinion of the expert review group was that given the available information and the lack of evidence of significant harm to either normal mothers or normal infants, there is no reason to conclude that exclusive breastfeeding should not continue to six months.What about starting solids AFTER 6 months? At what point does baby need nutrition from solids that cannot be provided by breastmilk alone?Medical research tells us that exclusive breastfeeding allows babies to thrive for the first 6 months. In the words of the World Health Organization,Breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants A recent review of evidence has shown that, on a population basis, exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is the optimal way of feeding infants.But what if baby is not very interested in solids at six months? Babies who are not yet interested in solid foods can and do thrive on breastmilk alone until 9-12 months or later. You might hear people say, Food before one is just for fun, but perhaps this should be changed to Food before one is mainly for fun. As long as your baby is continuing to grow and develop as he should, your milk is meeting his needs well. Sometime after six months, however, babies will gradually begin to need more iron and zinc than that provided by breastmilk alone  at that point, additional nutrients can be obtained from small amounts of solids. If your baby chooses to continue exclusive breastfeeding, simply keep an eye on growth and iron status, continue to watch your baby for signs that he is ready for solids, and offer appropriate solids for him to try  baby can decide whether or not to eat them. No matter when baby begins solid foods, breastmilk should make up the majority of babys nutrition through the end of the first year.What if my 4-5 month old seems developmentally ready for solids?Four- to five-month-old babies are sometimes very eager to participate at mealtime, but it doesnt necessarily mean that they are ready to eat solids  more often its just the normal developmental urge to do what everyone else is doing. Research studies tell us that there are many health advantages to delaying solids for about 6 months for all babies, not just the babies who are not yet interested in mealtime.There are a number of things you can do to let baby participate in mealtimes without starting solids:Let baby sit with the family at mealtime  in a lap, booster seat or high chair.Give baby a cup of water or expressed milk. Your baby can entertain himself at mealtime while learning to use a cup. 1-3 ounces of water in the cup should be plenty (often for the entire day). Many moms choose to use only water or a small amount of breastmilk to avoid wasting the liquid gold while baby learns to use the cup.Offer baby sips of water from your cup or straw. Even if baby hasnt figured out how to use a straw yet, you can put your straw in water, block the top end of the straw with your finger to trap a little water in the straw, then let baby drink the water from the lower end of the straw (unblock the top end once its in babys mouth).Offer baby spoons, cups, bowls and other baby-safe eating utensils to play with during mealtime.Give baby an ice cube (if its a baby-safe size & shape) or ice chips to play with.Offer baby a momsicle (popsicle made from breastmilk) or slushy frozen breastmilk to eat with a spoon.Myths about solids readinessThere are many myths and outdated information regarding how to tell if baby is ready for solids.MYTH: Babys weight has reached a magic numberJust because your baby achieves x number of pounds, or has doubled birth weight, (or however much your baby weighs) does not mean that she is automatically ready for solids  particularly if she is under 6 months.The American Academy of Pediatrics/World Health Organization recommendations for starting solids at 6 months or later has no exceptions for babies who weigh more. The research that Ive seen on the health benefits of starting solids at 6 months and later holds for all babies, no matter what their weight.Its the maturity of the digestive tract and babys developmental readiness that makes the difference, not babys weight.Its rather interesting to note that moms are told to start solids for both big and small babies. Its not even uncommon to hear opposite arguments for both sides from the same person!MYTH: Your baby is big so you need to start solids.Moms might be told to start solids for differing reasons when they have a large baby.Some are told that since baby is big, they wont be able to produce enough milk to satisfy baby. This is quite untrue  almost all mothers have the ability to produce enough milk to exclusively breastfeed twins and even triplets. If you allow your baby to nurse on cue, your body will make enough milk for your baby. In addition, research tells us that exclusively breastfed babies do not increase the amount of milk they drink after the first 4 weeks or so  after the first month, milk intake stays constant (except for temporary appetite spurts) until sometime after six months when baby begins to eat more solid foods and decrease milk intake.Other moms are told that baby is eating too much, so mom should reduce babys intake by limiting nursing and/or starting solids. There is absolutely NO evidence that a large breastfed baby will become a large child or adult, and limiting nursing can be quite dangerous for a baby. Read more here: Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?MYTH: Your baby is small so you need to start solids.Another reason often given for starting solids is because baby is small (see Normal Growth of Breastfed Babies). I really dont see the sense in this. Ounce for ounce, breastmilk has more calories than most baby-safe solid foods and significantly more nutrients than any type of solid food that you can feed your baby. Studies have shown that for babies under six months, solids tend toreplacebreastmilk in a babys diet  they do not add to babys total intake (WHO 2003,Cohen 1994,Dewey 1999). Sostarting solids will probably reduce (instead of increase) the amount of milk and calories that your baby is getting overall. One of the first recommendations for a baby who genuinely has slow weight gain is to decrease or eliminate solid foods and breastfeed more often.MYTH: Baby needs to start solids because there is not enough iron in breastmilk.An additional reason given for starting solids is the lack of iron in breastmilk. Breastmilk does have lower iron levels than formula, but the iron in breastmilk is more readily absorbed by the babys gut than the iron in formula. Also, formula-fed babies tend to lose iron through fissures that develop in their intestines as a result of damage from cows milk. Breastfed babies do not lose this iron. At some point after the first 6 months (later in the first year for a lot of babies), babies will require an additional source of iron other than mothers milk. This can most often be obtained through small amounts of solid food. Read more on iron and the breastfed baby here: Is Iron Supplementation Necessary?.MYTH: Baby needs solids so he will sleep longer at night.The popular belief that feeding solids at night will help baby sleep through the night has no basis in fact.

Are there nondairy substitutes?Additional informationCalcium and breastfeedingGeneral informationAllergy relatedJournal ArticlesDo nursing mothers need additional calcium?No. Pregnant and nursing mothers do not need additional calcium other than that normally required for their age group. The Institute of Medicine recommends that nursing mothers over the age of 18 consume 1,000 mg. of calcium daily  the same as other adults.See the links below for additional information on calcium and breastfeeding.What if I am breastfeeding AND pregnant?Hilary Flower researched this question for Adventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyond. She found three important facts that have come from the research of Dr. Ann Prentice in recent years:Recovery of bone mineral density occurs BEFORE weaning. The recovery begins after the babys diet begins to be supplemented with other foods or liquids (the partial breastfeeding phase). By 12 months breastfeeding mothers have fully recovered their bone mineral density.If a mother becomes pregnant before the recovery is complete, bone mineral density increases during pregnancy, a phenomonon not usually seen.Mothers who are tandem nursing fare the same as their breastfeeding peers.Flower comments: Eventually popular beliefs will catch up to the scientific advances of the last five years, and breastfeeding mothers will no longer have to fend off admonishments that their bones are in jeopardy. For their part, scientists have moved on. (Adventures in Tandem Nursing, p. 213)Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.What sort of calcium supplement is best?Calcium supplements should be combined with magnesium in a 2-1 ratio to allow for adequate assimilation into the body. Since dairy products are one of our major sources of zinc, added zinc is also recommended if you are avoiding dairy. Calcium/magnesium/zinc is a combination that is easily found as a supplement. Adding only a calcium supplement (like Tums) is not the best way to go.If youre not getting enough calcium from your diet and are considering using a calcium supplement, its recommended that you take a combination calcium/magnesium/zinc supplement of 1500 mg/day. If youre a vegetarian, then you probably need only 600-700 mg/day. Why the difference? Meat -the phosphorus content, Ive been told- interferes with calcium absorption, plus vegetarians eat more of the foods that have a high calcium content.In general, its considered safe to take up to 2500 mg of calcium daily, although this is more than needed. If you supplement more than 500 mg calcium per day, then divide the dose so youre not taking it all at once  calcium absorption is best when a person consumes no more than 500 mg at one time. Greatly excessive intake of calcium can cause numerous side effects.How does human milk compare to cows milk in calcium content?Human milk contains less calcium than cows milk, but the calcium in human milk has over twice the bioavailability of the calcium in cows milk. Increasing moms calcium intake does not increase the amount of calcium in her milk  moms milk has the right amount of calcium even if mom does not get enough in her diet.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on Calcium Requirements of Infants, Children, and Adolescents:No available evidence shows that exceeding the amount of calcium retained by the exclusively breastfed term infant during the first 6 months of life or the amount retained by the human milk-fed infant supplemented with solid foods during the second 6 months of life is beneficial to achieving long-term increases in bone mineralization Few data are available about the calcium requirements of children before puberty. Calcium retention is relatively low in toddlers and slowly increases as puberty approaches.Human milk averages 200-340 mg/liter [Hamosh 1991, Riordan & Auerbach 1999], or 5.9-10.1 mg/oz calcium. 67% of this calcium is absorbed by the body [Riordan & Auerbach 1999].Infant formulas contain 15.6 mg/oz calcium; toddler formulas contain 24-27 mg/oz calcium. Extra calcium is added to infant formulas because of the lower bioavailability of the calcium from formulas as compared to human milk (they aim for baby to absorb the same amount of calcium as would be absorbed from breastmilk).Whole milk contains 291 mg/8 oz or 36.4 mg/oz calcium. 25-30% of cows milk is absorbed by the body [Calcium Counseling Resources: Absorption / Utilization Issues from the National Dairy Council].List of nondairy foods that are high in calciumIf your baby (or you) is allergic to cows milk proteins, make sure you read the labels on any packaged foods to ensure that there are no hidden dairy ingredients.breastmilk (studies have shown that breastfed babies get plenty of calcium, even if mom doesnt eat dairy products)dark greens: broccoli, spinach, collards, kale, turnips, bok choy, parsley, mustard, dandeliontofu and other soy productsbeans: chickpeas/garbanzo beans, navy beans, pinto beans,nuts & seeds: sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, almonds, filberts/hazelnuts, cashews, nut butters, tahini, walnutssea vegetables: nori, kombu, wakame, agar-agargrains: tapioca, quinoa, tortillasseafood/fish: shrimp, salmon with bones, mackerel with bones, sardines with bonesherbs: borage, lambs quarter, wild lettuce, nettles, burdock, yellow dockcalcium-fortified orange juiceTotal cereal (calcium fortified)Gerber Graduate juices (calcium fortified)Sunny Delight Calcium orange drink (calcium fortified)Rice milk (calcium fortified)I really miss things like ice cream and cheese!

DHA supplements for breastfeeding mothers,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/dha-mother/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCAt present, there is a major marketing effort aimed at getting pregnant and breastfeeding women to take DHA supplements (the same supplements that are being marketed in the newer baby formulas).Heres a quick rundown on what DHA is: Mammals do not manufacture their own polyunsaturated fatty acids. Two of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, Omega-6 (linoleic acid is the primary source) and Omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid is the primary source), are considered to be essential fatty acids (EFAs) and have numerous health benefits. Deficiencies of either of these essential fatty acids are extremely rare in the United States and Canada. We convert these essential fatty acids in our bodies to other needed fatty acids, which we can also get from food sources. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) are made from linoleic acid; and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are made from alpha-linolenic acid.Babies, however, generate the fatty acids such as ARA and DHA more slowly than adults and thus need to get some via diet (i.e., breastmilk). In addition, there is evidence that adults eating a typical American diet do not get a large enough percentage of the Omega-3 fatty acids.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.There is no evidence whatsoever that breastmilk is deficient in DHA, and there is no evidence that DHA supplements taken by a nursing mother will improve the long term outcome or IQ of her baby. Nursing mothers who get more DHA do have have higher levels of DHA in their milk, but it is not known whether these higher levels are beneficial or what the optimal levels might be. Vegetarians, particularly vegans, tend to have lower levels of DHA in breastmilk.Dr. Thomas Hale recommends that normal breastfeeding women should not be supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). He indicates that while it is true that populations who ingest large quantities of fish and therefore polyunsaturated fatty acids do not have cardiovascular disease, he has indication that their rate of stroke is much higher, and so recommends that supplements not be used.Nursing and pregnant women are certainly encouraged to eat natural sources of DHA and alpha linolenic acid. Good sources include:cold water/oily fish and fish oils (e.g., salmon, mackerel, herring, tuna, sardines, anchovies); fresh fish is better, as freezing destroys some of the EFA; avoid consumption of fish that may be high in mercurygreen leaves of plants, including phytoplankton and algaesome seeds and nuts (flax seeds, walnuts, canola, linseeds, pumpkin seeds)some legumes (soy beans, Great Northern beans, kidney beans, navy beans)More InformationDietary Choices and DHA Supplementation from LLLs LEAVEN, Vol. 34 No. 5, October-November 1998, p. 102-103.DHA Levels in Breastmilk by Ricardo Uauy, a researcher in ChileDHA (docosahexaenoic acid) from AskDrSears.com (Dr. Sears is associated with Martek, a manufacturer of DHA supplements)General info (not lactation related)Essential Fatty Acids in Vegetarian Nutrition by Brenda Davis, RD (great reading even if you are not a vegetarian)Essential Fatty Acids by Christine Wood, MD, from KidsEatGreat.comFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Is Iron-Supplementation Necessary?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/iron/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCWhy is anemia uncommon in breastfed babies?Which babies are more at risk for iron-deficiency anemia?Why not use iron supplements as a protective measure for every baby?What are some good iron sources?What if my babys iron levels have been checked and are TOO LOW?In ConclusionAdditional InformationReferencesIts common knowledge that iron supplements are necessary after a baby reaches the magic age of six months. But is this an accurate statement? Lets look at some of the current research.Anemia is uncommon in breastfed babies for several reasonsHealthy, full-term babies have enough iron stores in their bodies to last for at least the first six months. The current research indicates that a babys iron stores should last between six and twelve months, depending upon the baby.The iron in breastmilk is better absorbed than that from other sources. The vitamin C and high lactose levels in breastmilk aid in iron absorption. Iron Source  Percentage of Iron Absorbed breastmilk~50  70%iron-fortified cow milk formula~3  12%iron-fortified soy formulaless than 1%  7%iron-fortified cereals4  10%cows milk~10%Note: The amount of iron absorbed from any food depends greatly upon the milk source of iron (eg, human vs cow), type of iron compound in the food, the bodys need for iron, and the other foods eaten at the same meal. Breastfed babies dont lose iron through their bowels; cows milk can irritate the intestinal lining (resulting in a tiny amount of bleeding and the loss of iron).The original iron stores of a full-term healthy baby, combinedwith the better-absorbed iron in breastmilk, are usually enoughto keep babys hemoglobin levels within the normal rangewell into the second six months.Which babies are more at risk for iron-deficiency anemia?Babies who were born prematurely, since babies get the majority of their iron stores from their mother during the last trimester of pregnancy.In addition, there is evidence that babies whose birth weights are less than 3000 grams  about 6.5 pounds  (whether term or premature) tend to have reduced iron stores at birth and appear to need additional iron earlier.Babies born to mothers with poorly controlled diabetes.Theoretically, babies born to mothers who were anemic during pregnancy could have lower iron stores, however medical studies do not show this to be a problem. Babies born to mothers who are anemic during pregnancy are no more likely to be iron deficient than those born to mothers who are not anemic during pregnancy.Babies who are fed cows milk (instead of breastmilk or iron-fortified formula) during the first year of life.Healthy, full-term infants who are breastfed exclusively for periods of 6-9 months have been shown to maintain normal hemoglobin values and normal iron stores. In one of these studies, done by Pisacane in 1995, the researchers concluded that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 7 months (and were not give iron supplements or iron-fortified cereals) had significantly higher hemoglobin levels at one year than breastfed babies who received solid foods earlier than seven months. The researchers found no cases of anemia within the first year in babies breastfed exclusively for seven months and concluded that breastfeeding exclusively for seven months reduces the risk of anemia.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The original recommendations for iron-fortified foods were based on a formula-fed babys need for them and the fact that breastmilk contains less iron than formula (doctors didnt know then that the iron in breastmilk is absorbed much better). Also, some babies do have lower iron stores and will need extra iron at some point in addition to what they are getting from solids (though this can often be remedied by making sure that solids are high in iron and vitamin C  see below).If mom or doctor is concerned about a babys iron levels, have the doctor to do a blood test for hemoglobin.Some babies are exclusively breastfed for a year (and occasionally up to two years) with no problems at all.Why not use iron supplements as a protective measure for every baby?The iron in breastmilk is bound to proteins which make it available to the baby only, thus preventing potentially harmful bacteria (like E.coli, Salmonella, Clostridium, Bacteroides, Escherichia, Staphylococcus) from using it. These two specialized proteins in breastmilk (lactoferrin and transferrin) pick up and bind iron from babys intestinal tract. By binding this iron, theystop harmful bacteria from multiplying by depriving them of the iron they need to live and grow, andensure that baby (not the bacteria) gets the available iron.The introduction of iron supplements and iron-fortified foods, particularly during the first six months, reduces the efficiency of babys iron absorption. As long as your baby is exclusively breastfed (and receiving no iron supplements or iron-fortified foods), the specialized proteins in breastmilk ensure that baby gets the available iron (instead of bad bacteria and such). Iron supplements and iron in other foods is available on a first come, first served basis, and there is a regular free-for-all in the babys gut over it. The bad bacteria thrive on the free iron in the gut. In addition, iron supplements can overwhelm the iron-binding abilities of the proteins in breastmilk, thus making some of the iron from breastmilk (which was previously available to baby only) available to bacteria, also. The result: baby tends to get a lower percentage of the available iron.Supplemental iron (particularly when administered in solution or as a separate supplement rather than incorporated into a meal) can interfere with zinc absorption. In addition, iron supplements and iron-fortified foods can sometimes cause digestive upsets in babies.A recent study (Dewey 2002) found that routine iron supplementation of breastfed babies with normal hemoglobin levels may present risks to the infant, including slower growth (length and head circumference) and increased risk of diarrhea.A recent review article on iron (Griffin and Abrams, 2001) indicates that if your baby is basically healthy, iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should not have developmental consequences.What are some good iron sources?La Leche League recommends that babies be offered foods that are naturally rich in iron, rather than iron-fortified foods. Read more about when to start solids here: Solid Foods and the Breastfed BabyFoods that are high in iron include:breastmilkwinter squashsweet potatoesprune juicemeat & poultry (beef, beef & chicken liver, turkey, chicken)mushroomssea vegetables (arame, dulse), algaes (spirulina), kelpgreens (spinach, chard, dandelion, beet, nettle, parsley, watercress)yellow dock rootgrains (millet, brown rice, amaranth, quinoa, breads with these grains)blackstrap molasses (try adding a little to cereal or rice)brewers yeastdried beans (lima, lentils, kidney)chili con carne with beanstofuegg yolksgrains (cooked cracked wheat, cornmeal, grits, farina, bran, breads with these grains)tomatodried fruit (figs, apricots, prunes, raisins)meat (pork)shellfish (clams, oysters, shrimp)tuna, sardinesWarning: Some of the foods listed above are not suitable for babies. Dried fruits should not be given to babies under a year old, due to the choking hazard. Also, pork, fish, shellfish, wheat, citrus fruits and eggs are highly allergenic and may not be suitable for babies who are at high risk for allergies. See Suggested ages for introducing allergenic foods for more information.Iron in the Vegan Diet by Reed Mangels, Ph.D., R.D. also has some great info on iron-rich foods.See also Iron Content of Common Foods from British Columbia Ministry of HealthYou may wish to give baby foods high in vitamin C along with iron-rich foods, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Cooking in a cast iron pan also increases iron content of foods. The absorption of iron is also increased by eating green leafy salads or citrus fruits, fruit juices and potatoes (including instant potatoes at meals when consuming iron rich foods).Heres a combination to try  Cook brown rice (put in the blender if baby needs a smoother texture) and mix it with stewed iron-containing fruits (apricots, prunes, etc). You can even add a touch of blackstrap molasses for extra flavor and extra iron.The caffeine/tannin in strong tea, coffee, chocolate and cola drinks interferes with the absorption of iron; avoid having these one hour before and one hour after iron rich foods (this note is for adults and children  none of these things are recommended for babies).What if my babys iron levels have been checked and are TOO LOW? For those babies who do need iron supplementation (hemoglobin levels have been checked and are too low), its important to make sure that the solids that baby eats are high in iron and vitamin C. In addition, the combination of yellow dock and dandelion root tinctures are said to be great (and non-constipating) for raising iron levels.Note: Additional iron intake by the mother will not increase iron levels in breastmilk, even if the mother is anemic. Iron supplements taken by mom may produce constipation in baby. Anemia in the nursing mother has been associated with poor milk supply, however.One nutritionist I know of has recommended that if this is the first time that youve gotten a reading below normal (if it is truly below normal  see below) then talk with your doctor about trying FIRST to correct it with diet, then after a few months have a re-test. If its still low at that point, then iron supplements may be warranted.Keep in mind that if your baby has been ill recently, his iron levels may be temporarily low due to the illness (see Hoffman, Ronald, et al. Chapter 154: Hematologic Manifestations of Childhood Illness :Infectious Disease Changes in Red Blood Cells: Anemia of Acute Infections.Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders/Elsevier, 2013.)Another cause of anemia is lead poisoning  this should be ruled out if your child is anemic. Two of the most common sources of lead exposure in children include (1) paint dust from chipped or peeling lead paint and/or home renovation (may be present in any home built prior to 1978) and (2) lead contaminated drinking water from lead water pipes or lead solder.Normal iron levelsAgeHemoglobinconcentration(grams per deciliter)Hematocrit (Hct)%[measures iron stores]Serum Ferritin(micrograms per liter)newborn13.5-2442-68-not available-One week10-2031-67-not available-1-2 months10-1828-55-not available-2-6 months9.5-1428-42-not available-6-12 months10.5-14(12 average)33-42(37 average)15 is minimum(30 average)1-2 years11.0-1332.9-41(30 average)2-5 years11.1-1334-40-not available-Sources:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

J Nutr. 2002 Dec;132(12):3680-6.Read about how one mother successfully battled anemia in her baby without using iron supplements: Anemia No More.In Conclusion My interpretation of this information is that there is no problem with (and lots of advantages to) continuing with exclusive breastfeeding until your baby is truly ready for solids. At some point toward the end of the first year, your baby will gradually begin to need more iron than that provided by breastmilk alone, so offer your baby foods naturally rich in iron and vitamin C as he begins to eat solids. If there is any question of anemia, get a blood test  if babys hemoglobin levels are OK then there is no reason for additional iron in the diet.Additional InformationDoes My Baby Need Vitamins?Solid Foods and the Breastfed BabyWhy Delay Solids?Iron Fortified Cereal in Breastfed Infants by Jay Gordon, MDBreastfeeding and Other Foods (see the section on iron) by Dr. Jack NewmanWhat to Feed the Baby when the Mother is Working outside the Home by Dr. Jack Newman (solids & iron needs are discussed here, too)What can I do for my childs iron deficiency anemia? by Alan Greene, MD, FAAPAnemia and children by Jay Gordon, MD Routine Iron Supplementation during Pregnancy by John W.

Lecithin treatment for recurrent plugged ducts,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/lecithin/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCLecithin has been recommended to combat recurrent plugged ducts. The usual recommended dosage for recurrent plugged ducts is 3600-4800 mg lecithin per day, or 1 capsule (1200 milligram) 3-4 times per day. After a week or two with no blockage, mom can reduce the dosage by one capsule. If there is no blockage within another 2 weeks she can reduce it again by one. Mom may need to continue taking 1-2 capsules per day if stopping the lecithin leads to additional plugged ducts.Lecithin is a very common food additive, and is found naturally in many other foods. There are no known contraindications to its use by breastfeeding mothers.The reason why lecithin may help resolve and prevent plugged ducts is not clear. Per Dr. Jack Newman, It may do this by decreasing the viscosity (stickiness) of the milk by increasing the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the milk. Lecithin is an emulsifier (used to keep fats/oils dispersed and in suspension): phospholipid molecules (such as lecithin) contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements; the hydrophobic portion has an affinity for fats and oils, and the hydrophilic portion has an affinity for water.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Additional safety information:Per The Doctors Vitamin and Mineral Encyclopedia by Sheldon Saul Hendler, MD, Ph.D. (1990, p. 258-269), the maximum dosage of lecithin is 50 grams per day. The maximum dosage recommendation for recurrent plugged ducts is 4.8 grams per dayless than 1/10 of the maximum recommended dosage.Choline is a component of lecithin  the lecithin sold in health food stores is about 1-2% choline. Rarely, people who take pure choline can develop a fish odor- this is due to a liver enzyme deficiency that impairs choline metabolism. The form of choline in lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) should not cause this problem. If you develop a fishy body odor, stop taking choline supplements and see your physician. People with liver failure may develop this deficiency, as may those with normal livers who take more than 20 grams of (pure) choline per day.Also, people with a preexisting tendency to depression may become depressed if taking high doses of choline or lecithin. These people should be monitored by a physician.More information on lecithin and breastfeeding can be found here.B-complex, evening primrose oil and thyme have also been recommended for treating recurrent plugged ducts.Related Items from the KellyMom store:Postnatal supplements with 6,400 IU of vitamin D for nursing mothers.Use code KELLYMOM for 10% off!FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Vitamins & other supplements for breastfeeding mothers,http://kellymom.com/ages/tandem/mom-vitamins/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCIf you eat a reasonably-well balanced diet, vitamin supplements are not considered necessary for breastfeeding mothers.This is even true for mothers who are eating for three during tandem nursing, or while breastfeeding during pregnancy (see Nutrition for mom in our Nursing During Pregnancy and Tandem Nursing FAQ).According to Nutrition During Lactation (Hamosh, 1991):The evidence does not warrant routine vitamin-mineral supplementation of lactating women Encourage lactating women to follow dietary guidelines that promote a generous intake of nutrients from fruits and vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, calcium-rich dairy products, and protein-rich foods such as meats, fish and legumes. Such a diet would ordinarily supply a sufficient quantity of essential nutrients Encourage sufficient intake of fluids  especially water, juice, and milk  to alleviate natural thirst. It is not necessary to encourage fluid intake above this level Calcium, multivitamin-mineral supplements, or both may be advised when dietary sources are marginal and it is unlikely that appropriate dietary practices will or can be followed. What if I do NOT eat a reasonably-well balanced diet?Except in special circumstances, women in developed countries are not likely to have nutritional deficiencies that will affect their milk.The Recommended Intakes (RI) for nutrients have a wide safety margin built in  if you do not meet the RI for a nutrient, it does not mean that you are deficient. If a mother does not get adequate amounts of certain nutrients (such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12 or iodine) it can decrease nutrient levels in her milk, however this is usually only a problem in areas of malnutrition. The best solution in such cases is to improve or supplement the mothers diet. For other nutrients (including folic acid, iron, calcium, copper, magnesium, zinc) milk levels will be fine even if the mothers intake is too low.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The nutrients most likely to be of concern for a woman eating an average (unsupplemented) American diet of 2700 calories per day are calcium and zinc. However, your intake of calcium or zinc does not affect breastmilk levels of these minerals, so if supplements are needed, they are for your benefit  not babys.(Hamosh, 1991; Lawrence & Lawrence, 2005)For mothers who are cutting calories:Mothers who get 2200 calories per day may need extra calcium, zinc, magnesium, thiamin (vitamin B1), vitamin B-6 & vitamin E.Mothers who get 1800 calories per day may need extra calcium, zinc, magnesium, thiamin, vitamin B6, vitamin E, folic acid, riboflavin (vitamin B2), phosphorus and iron.Breastmilk levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, iron and folic acid are fine even if your diet is deficient. If supplements are needed, they are for your benefit  not babys.Levels of B vitamins in breastmilk are related to the mothers intake, but a deficiency in the mother serious enough to affect her breastfed baby is very rare in the United States.(Hamosh, 1991; Lawrence & Lawrence, 2005)Mothers who eat no animal products or are otherwise at risk for vitamin B-12 deficiency need to get adequate amounts of vitamin B12 from supplements or fortified foods.Mothers who have little exposure to sunlight need to get adequate amounts of vitamin D from supplements or vitamin D-rich foods.Mothers who smoke cigarettes may benefit from additional iodine.What if I would like to take extra vitamins or other nutritional supplements? Is this safe?Most mineral supplements (e.g., iron, calcium, copper, chromium, zinc) taken by the mother do not affect breastmilk levels.Water soluble vitamin supplements (e.g., B vitamins, vitamin C) taken by the mother usually increase breastmilk levels. Breastmilk levels of some water soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C, only increase up to a certain point, then remain steady  even if mom increases her dose.Fat soluble vitamin supplements (e.g., vitamins A & E) taken by the mother can concentrate in human milk, and thus excessive amounts may be harmful to a breastfeeding baby.The safety of herbs and other nutritional supplements should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis  some are safe and some are not.For information on specific vitamins, minerals and other nutritional supplements, see:Daily Dietary Reference Intakes  Women aged 19-50 @ Daily Dietary Reference Intakes  Women (teens) aged 14-18 @ Herbs and Breastfeeding @ Additional information@ DHA supplements for nursing mothersVitaminsDoes My Baby Need Vitamins?FAQs about Moms DietIs This Safe When Breastfeeding?Hamosh M, Dewey KG, Garza C, et al: Nutrition During Lactation.

Human milk normally contains variable amounts of biotin. The biotin content of human milk increases with the progression of lactation, and is directly related to the amount of biotin in moms plasma (blood). The biotin content of human milk is hundreds of times greater than the content in maternal plasma. (from Nutrition During Lactation, Institute of Medicine). Taking a biotin supplement might change the taste of your milk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.[return to index]ChromiumPer Hale, (Medications and Mothers Milk), breast milk levels of chromium are independent of dietary intake in mother, and do not apparently increase with increased maternal intake.[return to index]CopperPer Nutrition During Lactation (Institute of Medicine, 1991), there is no relationship between maternal copper status and concentrations in human milk.[return to index]FluorideAccording to Nutrition During Lactation, (Institute of Medicine, 1991), reports indicate that there is relatively little effect of maternal fluoride intake on the fluoride concentration of milk.[return to index]GlucosamineDr. Hales text lists glucosamine as category L3 or moderately safe while breastfeeding. It is unlikely that the baby would receive an amount from breastfeeding that would be clinically significant. No pediatric concerns have been noted from breastmilk exposure. See his book for more information.[return to index]IronPer Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk), no pediatric concerns have been reported via breastmilk when mom is taking iron. Rarely, iron supplements taken by mom may produce constipation in baby.Iron supplements taken by the mother will not increase iron levels in breastmilk, even if the mother is anemic. Anemia in the nursing mother has been associated with poor milk supply, however.Nursing moms need 9-18 mg daily of iron (this includes all food sources)  the higher level would be for a mom who has resumed menstruating. If you are anemic, ask your DR what dosage of iron supplement (if any) is recommended. You can often bring your iron levels up just by changing your diet a bit  getting more food sources of iron and vitamin C (which increases iron absorption)  more on this in the link below.The standard iron supplements are mineral-based (ferrous sulfate). There are also a chelated iron supplement (iron bisglycinate) and a liquid plant-based iron supplement (one brand is called Floradix) that are reported to be easier absorbed and non-constipating. Tinctures containing herbs such as yellow dock and dandelion (heres an example) are also high in iron.See also Is Iron-Supplementation (for baby) Necessary? (includes a list of iron-rich foods)[return to index]LecithinThere are no known contraindication to the use of moderate amounts of lecithin by breastfeeding mothers.See Lecithin treatment for recurrent plugged ducts for more information.[return to index]L-Lysine Lysine is a normal amino acid. There is no evidence that this is a problem for babies via breastmilk.[return to index]ManganesePer Nutrition During Lactation (Institute of Medicine, 1991), manganese concentration in human milk may be influenced by maternal diet.[return to index]Pantothenic acidPer Nutrition During Lactation (Institute of Medicine, 1991), pantothenic acid content of human milk increases with increased dietary intake.[return to index]SeleniumSelenium toxicity is very rare and results from levels significantly higher than normally found in human milk. The EPA Reference Dose (RfD) is 5 g/kg body weight/day. Selenium Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 45 ug/day for 0-6 months, increases for older children, and is 400 ug for adults (including lactation). Selenium levels in human milk average 20 ug/L, or 20 ug per 35 oz milk, and range from 10-30 ug/L. For comparison, a brazil nut weighs about 1/7 oz and 1/4 cup (2 oz) contains 1036 ug selenium; so one brazil nut would contain around 74 ug selenium.The main problem appears to be getting *enough* selenium. Ruth Lawrence notes Although selenium toxicity is possible, deficiency from low intake is a problem.[return to index]Thiamin / Vitamin B1Per Breastfeeding: a guide for the Medical Professional (Lawrence & Lawrence, 1999, p. 309), maternal supplementation [of Vitamin B1/thiamin] does not increase milk levels beyond a certain limit In malnourished women, evidence indicates that supplementation does increase thiamin levels in milk. Per Nutrition During Lactation (Institute of Medicine, 1991, p. 126), that limit has been estimated to be 200 micrograms per liter, which is the Daily Reference Intake for infants 0-5 months old.[return to index]Vitamin APer Hale, vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that is secreted into human milk and primarily sequestered in high concentrations in the liver. Overdose of vitamin A is extremely dangerous and adults should never exceed 3000 g per day. Use normal doses. DO NOT use maternal doses greater than 3000 g per day. Maternal milk is rich in vitamin A. Infants do not generally require vitamin A supplementation.[return to index]Vitamin B2Per Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk), no pediatric concerns have been reported via breastmilk. Approved by the AAP for use in nursing moms. This vitamin can turn your urine a fluorescent yellow color, and has been known to tint moms milk yellow also.[return to index]Vitamin B6Per Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk), no pediatric concerns have been reported via breastmilk. Approved by the AAP for use in nursing moms.According to Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk), Vit B6 shouldnt be taken in excess of 25 mg per day. Very high dosages (600 mg/day) suppress prolactin secretion and therefore will reduce milk production. Excessive oral doses in infants have been reported to produce side-effects in infants (sedation, hypotonia and respiratory distress), but no concerns have been reported via breastmilk.The vitamin B6 content of milk is directly related to maternal intake, but vitamin B-6 deficiency is rare in the United States. According to one study, B6 levels in women who supplemented with 2.5 mg per day are twice as high as those of unsupplemented women. As far as I could see, this reference didnt discuss moms supplementing with more than 10 mg per day (they were concerned more with deficiencies).[return to index]Vitamin B12Mothers who are on strict vegan diets (that do not include fish, meat, and dairy products) may benefit from vitamin B12 supplements. Mothers who have had gastric bypass surgery are also at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, and may also need small supplements of this vitamin. For a more detailed writeup on vitamin B12, see Does my baby need vitamin B12 supplements?Per Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk), no pediatric concerns have been reported via breastmilk. Approved by the AAP for use in nursing moms.[return to index]Vitamin CVitamin C (ascorbic acid) is secreted into human milk, but excessive vitamin C intake in the mother does not alter (or increase) the controlled secretion into breastmilk. Maternal supplementation is only required in undernourished mothers. Pregnant women should not use excessive ascorbic acid due to metabolic induction in the fetal liver, followed by a metabolic rebound scurvy early postpartum in the newborn.[return to index]Vitamin EIt is not recommended that nursing moms overdose on vitamin E  the recommended intake for nursing mothers is 19 mg/day. Too much vitamin E can raise babys vitamin E levels to toxic levels.[return to index]ZincIncreasing moms zinc intake does not increase the amount of zinc in her milk.Per Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk): The Recommended Daily Allowance for adults is 12-15 mg/day. The average oral dose of supplements is 25-50 mg/day, higher doses may lead to gastritis. Doses used for treatment of cold symptoms averaged 13.3 mg (lozenges) every 2 hours while awake for the duration of cold symptoms. The acetate or gluconate salts are preferred due to reduced gastric irritation and higher absorption. Zinc sulfate should not be used. Excessive intake is detrimental higher levels of oral zinc intake probably have minimal effect on zinc concentrations in milk no pediatric concerns reported via milk.Avoid taking more than 150 mg/day of zinc (from all sources). Its a good idea (for anyone, not just nursing mothers) to avoid taking higher amounts of zinc (more than the recommended daily intake of 8-12 mg/day) for more than 7 days.See also (not lactation related): Berger A.

Who needs vitamin B12 supplements?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b12/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCInfants of well-nourished mothers with adequate vitamin B12 intake do not need vitamin B12 supplements.It is recommended that mothers who do not eat animal proteins or who are otherwise at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency get adequate amounts of vitamin B12 during pregnancy and lactation via supplements or fortified foods.Since vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is widely present in foods from animal sources, dietary deficiency is rare except in those eating a strict vegan diet (no fish, meat, poultry, eggs or dairy products). Most infants, children and adults in the United States get the recommended amounts of vitamin B12. If a breastfeeding mother has an adequate B12 status, her baby will receive sufficient amounts of vitamin B12 via her milk. A simple blood test can diagnose current vitamin B12 deficiency.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.In the US, the DRI for vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 g per day, 2.6 g during pregnancy, 2.8 g during lactation; the DRI is proportionally less for children. The DRI has a significant margin of safety built in. Unlike other B vitamins, small amounts of vitamin B12 are stored in the liver so daily consumption is not necessary.Who is at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency?Anyone who is on a strict vegetarian or vegan diet (no fish, meat, poultry, eggs or dairy products) and is not getting adequate amounts of vitamin B12 through supplements or fortified foods.Anyone who has had gastric bypass surgery, has pernicious anemia or has certain gastrointestinal disorders and is not getting adequate amounts of vitamin B12 through supplements or fortified foods. Some medications may also decrease absorption of vitamin B12.An infant born to a mother who has been a strict vegetarian or vegan for at least 3 years and who is vitamin B12 deficient herself.An infant born to a mother who is vitamin B12 deficient due to any other dietary or medical reason.An exclusively breastfed baby of a woman who is vitamin B12 deficient.According to Nutrition During Lactation (Hamosh 1991, p. 157-58), a full-term infant of a well-nourished mother will be born with a store of vitamin B12 sufficient to meet his needs for about 8 months. If the mother is not vitamin B12 deficient herself, then her milk is an excellent source of vitamin B12 and is more than sufficient for babys needs through the first year.There is evidence that babies born to vitamin B12 deficient mothers have low stores of vitamin B12 at birth. Studies have shown that mothers who are vitamin B12 deficient have low levels of vitamin B12 in their milk.Breastfed infants may develop clinical signs of vitamin B12 deficiency before their mothers do. Vitamin B12 deficiency may develop in the breastfed infant by 2  6 months of age, but may not be clinically apparent until 6  12 months. Signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency in infants include vomiting, lethargy, anemia, failure to thrive, hypotonia (low muscle tone), and developmental delay/regression.There have been anecdotal reports of low milk supply in vitamin B12 deficient mothers, which improved when the B12 deficiency was corrected. Mothers with pernicious anemia are also at higher risk for thyroid problems, which can affect milk supply.For mothers who are vitamin B12 deficient, increasing vitamin B12 intake increases the amount of the vitamin in her milk.More information:Vegetarian Moms and Breastfeeding @Vitamins (& other supplements) for Nursing Moms @The Vegan Diet During Pregnancy and Lactation by Reed Mangels, PhD, RDHamosh M, Dewey, Garza C, et al: Nutrition During Lactation.

Are you feeling overwhelmed by your child’s intense needs?,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/velcrochild/,"But how much intense parenting they need, possibly including frequent nursing, in the second year depends for the most part on their inborn timetable for emotional development. As parents we can slow down emotional growth by leaving needs unmet. But there is nothing extra we can do to speed it up. your investment in your toddler who seems to be always attached will pay off when the time for independence does come. Norma Jane Bumgarner in Mothering Your Nursing ToddlerOlder babies and toddlers can get really clingy at times. Sometimes it seems as if your child has been nursing all day (or all night), or has been clinging to your leg all day long (even when you go to the bathroom) and you really just need a break.These velcro days usually have a cause (even if we only know after the fact): teething, illness, a developmental advance. But even when you know the reason behind a clingy episode, it can still be very frustrating, particularly if you had something you expected to get done or if you were simply anticipating some time to yourself.Do know that each of us gets overwhelmed from time to time. Remember  these moments pass, even though it may seem like forever when youre in the middle of one of these days.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Ive gathered a few tips for dealing with these velcro days, but Id like to get your suggestions and experiences, too. Please e-mail me with your comments, and Ill include them here.If your child is being particularly clingy and youre having a hard time dealing with it, take her outside for a while (or to the park, to the store, etc.). The change of scene will do both of you good.If you feel that your child is under your feet all the time when youre trying to get things done around the house, have her help out. Toddlers love to help, and they can do things like fold small towels or diapers, dry dishes, sweep with a small broom, help set the table, wipe the counter, etc. It might take a little more time, but it can make things less frustrating for both of you and its also a learning experience for your toddler.Referencing some books on child development can help you figure out expectations for your child at each particular age. I like the Barrons Educational Series Keys to Parenting titles and the classic series by Ames and Ilg, Your x Year Old. Just look around wherever you see parents and children together and youll see so many active misconceptions about what children are capable of doing and what they need to be doing at each stage. Where have our ideas come from? What are our assumptions? Are they reasonable? My oldest son was fully 2 years old before he ever sat still and played by himself. After more than a year of waiting, wishing, wanting 20 minutes to myself, when he finally sat and played for one hour nonstop I was so stunned that I wasted the entire hour watching him!  AnitaSome children will kick, move around, grab at your face, and so on, while nursing. This can get old, especially if they are nursing very often, and can also hurt mom. Most older babies can understand (and accept) it when you tell her that she needs to be still if she wants to nurse. See this article for more on nursing manners.If your child is having a major clingy day and its driving you crazy, plan to get some time to yourself after your partner gets home. Have him take over with the kids, and either go out for a bit (take a walk, go shopping, work out) or take a child-free break at home (take a nap, read a book, take a bath).Many parents have bedtime struggles. As far as bedtime, weve never tried to institute anything formal with our babies. As with nursing, eating, using the potty, etc., we pretty much let them regulate their own needs. My toddler always tells me when he is tired and ready to climb into bed  and he hasnt skipped a night yet! This is stress free for all parties and works for us. Because of kindergarten, my older son does have a pretty regular routine of bath, story/backrub, bed, but the sequence is more important than the hour. With him, we have found that playtime or TV between bath and bed is not a good idea because it energizes his body and imagination.  AnitaBe good to yourself. Eat well, drink your water, get physical outside and aim for more R&R when the going is especially rough. Find some time in your day  even if it is just for a few minutes, even if you have a baby at the breast  to practice some relaxation breathing.Then count your blessings and try to get a mental picture of what you want your relationship with your children to look like in the long run. Often our own childhood stuff keeps playing in our head. I recommend Harville Hendrix Giving the Love That Heals for some thought-provoking reading on conscious parenting. Anyways, get a picture and then you can begin to decide what you want to do. No one else can do that for you.  AnitaThose around us  spouse, family, friends  are usually influencing our relationship with our children by their support or lack thereof. Is our stress with our children really rooted in one of our other relationships? Are we getting the physical and emotional support we need/want to handle our mothering responsibilities? Are we getting the respect and warm fuzzies we feel we deserve? Are we putting too much on our to-do list? Are we giving ourselves over to others who have great needs? Has our stay-at-home status diminished our self-esteem or increased our financial burden? Have economics or the demands of attachment parenting lead us to give up social activities or contacts?If we trust that our baby  not us, not the doctor, grandma, neighbor, friend, but the baby  is the only one that knows how much they need from us, then its important to look at these other factors.  AnitaOnly you can determine what your limits are and what you want/need to do for your children and yourself. When we are pushed past our personal limits, many of us experience resentment and anger. I think our children pick up on this and feel threatened. During these times, my children turn all of their energy toward keeping my attention on them. Many moms have found that this sort of thing can happen (for example) during phone calls and when they are attempting weaning. When I stop, take a deep breath and totally surrender my whole self, body and soul, to my boys, theyre usually pretty quick to let go and get on with their business. If they dont, it doesnt matter because by that time I am totally relaxed and focused on them and not on the stressful stuff outside our relationship.  Anita From a post to ParentsPlace.com (now defunct) on nursing clingy toddlers:I have a 2.5-year-old son that just cant get enough. There are days that he will nurse every five minutes. Thank God there are other days that he will not nurse for eight to ten hours. He eats like a horse and drinks more water than I do. His requirements are just enormous.There are times when I just cant stand it anymore. Like today, he has been nursing all day! Everytime I sit down there he is there sucking away. I had to have a break for a bit so I came into the lovely gated computer room for a bit. There are other times though when it doesnt bother me at all. Then there are times that I am incredibly thankful for all the time that he nurses. My point is that I have discovered that these are my hang ups and my feelings not his. I am the adult and I should be the one with impulse control and the ability to be patient so that my son can have what he needs. He is the one who is the most important in the equation. This does not mean that I neglect myself. What this means is that I really try to follow his rhythm. If he needs to nurse, we nurse. When he is in the stages of not needing to nurse as much I take full advantage and do many of the things that I need to do to revitalize myself. He really does wax and wane and thats what I try to remember whenever I am feeling suffocated.The other thing that I try to remind myself of is that he will be this way for a very short time. In a few short years hell be embarrassed to have me around. This is such a special time with him and I want to take full advantage. We all want to seem to wish it away, make it go faster and then when it passes we are sad.Hang in there it will get better. If you have never been to a LLL meeting you may try it. It is extraordinarily helpful to be in the presence of moms that are nursing toddlers when you are. It is great to have someone to vent to because I think that we have all probably felt the way that you are feeling now.  AmyFrom a post to ParentsPlace.com, some thoughts for anyone in the Breastfeeding-a-Toddler-Barracuda Boat: Feeling stuck? Its hard to believe toddlers grow out of this, but they do! Ive met some breastfeeding toddlers who are content to nurse just at bedtimes or other limited situations. Mine was definitely not one of them! Especially as she approached two years of age, I could only describe her breastfeeding pattern as voracious!Sometimes (often) I would feel overwhelmed; mostly, I became worried that I had created a monster, that she would never, never wean. I would be forever at the mercy of this tantruming, guzzling beastie. Well, I was wrong.Amazingly, and without me changing a blessed thing, my daughter began a serious trend to weaning at about two-and-a-half. She began sleeping through the night without help. She accepted negotiation re: breastfeeding times and places pretty calmly. And the length of her feedings shortened dramatically. Shes still breastfeeding at almost-4, but its so minimal that its no problem; in fact, its now just a lovely and easy connection that Im often relieved to call on (when shes heading for meltdown).I have two thoughts for anyone in the Breastfeeding-a-Toddler-Barracuda Boat:Try, try, try to believe that your child will actually grow up. I know, you look at her and see that gaping mouth growing bigger and bigger and you wonder how youre going to practicedont offer, dont refuse with a teenager. Look hard at the little independencies your child is accomplishing and tell yourself (out loud helps) that she will grow up. Because she will; its guaranteed.Try to discern the one thing that drives you the farthest up the wall right now. If its lo-o-o-o-o-ong feedings, try counting to twenty to time the sessions (count slow on good days, fast on stressful days). If its waking at night, go hog-wild on daytime nursings as you try to limit nighttime feeds. If its breastfeeding in public, have a round at home before you hit the mall. You get the idea  Once you know what your particular hot-spot is, ask for suggestions from other mums. Theyve been there. Breastfeeding a walking, talking demanding little person can be very overwhelming and Ive found that when mums of breastfeeding toddlers get stressed (myself most definitely included) we tend to blame the breastfeeding. After all, our doctors, relatives, and neighbors think its downright weird, so it must be the problem, eh? Then we formulate a plan: Thats it. I cant take this anymore. Im weaning. Today. Sometimes all we need is to pinpoint the one thing that will give us a leeeetle respite. Amazingly, with just a little room to breathe, we often rediscover the joy of these special times.Of course, the decision to continue or to wean involves two people. And if mum is feeling resentful or at the mercy of her child even after trying to make smaller changes, maybe weaning is the best choice.For myself, I made the decision to continue because the very intensity of my daughters attachment convinced me that she needed this very much; more than I needed my space. I also thought that if I wasnt nurturing with breastfeeding, Id still be doing it some other way.

Breastfeeding to Sleep and Other Comfort Nursing,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/comfortnursing/,"Many mothers feel guilty for breastfeeding their baby for comfort or as they drift off to sleep. Breastfeeding your child to sleep and for comfort is not a bad thing to do in fact, its normal, healthy, and developmentally appropriate. Most babies nurse to sleep and wake 1-3 times during the night for the first year or so. Some babies dont do this, but they are the exception, not the rule. Many children, if given the choice, prefer to nurse to sleep through the second year and beyond. Ive never seen a convincing reason why mothers shouldnt use this wonderful tool that weve been given.Breastfeeding is obviously designed to comfort and help a child sleep. Breastfeeding calms a child and can even help your child handle stress better when not breastfeeding (Beijers et al, 2013). Sucking releases the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) in both mother and baby, which results in a sleepy feeling (Uvns-Moberg et al, 1993). In addition, breastmilk also contains sleep-inducing hormones, amino acids, and nucleotides, whose concentrations are higher during the nightand may actually help babies establish their own circadian rhythms (Snchez et al, 2009,Cohen et al, 2012).If breastfeeding your child to sleep and/or nursing your child for comfort is working for YOU and your family, thats all that really matters! Breastfeeding is not only nourishing; its also nurturing. Your breast is a wonderful place of comfort and security to your child, not just a feeding trough. The time spent breastfeeding your child is a very short period in the total life of your child, but the memories of your love and availability will last him a lifetime. Trust that your child will fall asleep on his own in time, and enjoy every sleepy moment while it lasts.fNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Following are some Frequently Asked QuestionsMy child sometimes nurses for comfort, when hes obviously not hungry. Is this a problem?Am I creating a bad habit by allowing baby to breastfeed to sleep?What about letting baby cry it out?Ive been told that my child will NEVER learn to go to sleep on his own if we dont teach himHow will my child go to sleep when Im not there to breastfeed him, or after he weans?How can I gently encourage my child to fall asleep without breastfeeding (and without crying)?My child wants to comfort nurse the entire time hes napping! How can I slip away without waking him?My toddler wants to comfort nurse forever when hes trying to fall asleep.Additional resourcesMy child sometimes nurses for comfort, when hes obviously not hungry. Is this a problem?Comfort nursing is normal. If baby were not comfort nursing he would need to be sucking on his hands or on a pacifier. The breast was the first pacifier and the one that all others are modeled after, so dont be afraid to allow baby to use it in this way. There are studies that show that comfort nursing is healthy for your child, too. All babies need to suck  some more than others. It ensures that they survive. If your baby seems to be comfort nursing all the time and this is more than you can handle, keep in mind that this will probably ease some as time goes by. In the meantime, you may find that carrying baby in a sling or a carrier on your body will lessen his need to comfort nurse so much. He may just need to be close to you at times and seeks out nursing as a way to do that.Comfort nursing serves a purpose, too. Studies seem to indicate that this type of sucking overall decreases a babys heart rate and lets him relax. It seems to have a very positive effect on his whole physical and emotional well-being. Dont be afraid to allow this type of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is more than just imparting fluids and nourishment. Its a way to nurture your child as well.Am I creating a bad habit by allowing baby to breastfeed to sleep?Your childs desire to nurse to sleep is very normal and not a bad habit youve fostered. Dont be afraid to nurse your baby to sleep or fear that you are perpetuating a bad habit. Baby often will seek the breast when sleepy or over-stimulated because its a comforting and familiar place to him. To associate the breast with wanting to relax enough to go to sleep makes perfect sense. As adults, we also do things to relax ourselves so we can go to sleep: we read, watch TV, get something warm to drink or a snack, deep breathe, get all snug under the covers, etc. Breastfeeding does the same thing for your baby.For many babies at the height of exploration or distractibility, nighttime or naptime can often be the ONLY time the baby will nurse well. Allowing him to nurse at these times when he is more focused on nursing and less intent on other things helps ensures that he gets enough milk, that your supply is maintained, and that the nursing relationship goes on. Dont be afraid to nurse at these times or fear that you are perpetuating a bad habit. Instead, take advantage of these times for better nursing.The sleep issue is not merely a matter of good versus bad habits. It is much more an issue of culture and lifestyle and expectations. Here are three approaches to parenting issues:Forcing baby to change to fit the parents lifestyle is one approach. Our American culture tends not to be very baby friendly, and rarely makes accommodations for breastfeeding babies. The current trend, seen in many popular books and parenting magazines, is to force baby to do all of the accommodating so that we experience as little change in our pre-baby lifestyle as possible; for example, baby MUST sleep through the night so that we get unbroken sleep and a good baby is seen as one who makes as few demands on his parents as possible.Another approach is to try to approximate the mothering style of traditional societies and let the parents do all the accommodating. This approach can be very difficult to pull off without lots of support and changes of expectations in the people around us.A third approach is to do as much accommodating on the parental side as possible, and then to ask baby to accommodate the last part of the gap. This is an approach that can work for many families. With this approach, parents do all they can to be sensitive to their babys needs, and only ask baby to accommodate when nothing else truly works.What about letting baby cry it out?There are two schools of thought about getting babies to sleep. One is a rather rigid method of sleep training where a baby is put down awake in a crib and left to cry himself to sleep so that he learns to self-soothe and doesnt develop sleep associations that require someone else to put him to sleep. This method has been around since the 1890s and was dreamed up by male university sleep laboratory researchers. Many of the popular sleep training methods of today are modified versions of this (allowing baby to cry for progressively longer periods without comforting him, instead of just leaving him to cry until he gives up and stops).I cant, with good conscience, recommend the cry-it-out method for getting baby to sleep. Anyone who advises you to let your baby cry until he gives up and falls asleep is focusing on the babys behavior (going to sleep by himself) and not on how the baby feels in the process. In my opinion, this sleep training often creates an unhealthy attitude about sleep: after going through this training, baby tends to view sleep as a fearful state to enter into and to remain in. Parents often need to retrain baby if there is any break in the usual routine. In addition, it can condition parents to ignore babys cries, and break down the relationship of trust between parent and child.Younger babies, in particular, do not have that sense of object permanence and if mom leaves them to cry, they are developmentally unable to realize that she is just in the next room. All baby knows is that he has been abandoned and that mom is not there. A young baby can only express his needs through crying. A baby who is left to cry alone will eventually stop crying because he has abandoned all hope that help will come: as far as he can tell, no one cares enough to listen, or come and provide comfort. In the book Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent, anthropology professor Meredith Small writes, When signals are missed, babies stop signalling; they withdraw; they suck their thumbs; they turn away; they try to right the system themselves by not sending out any more signals. The baby protects himself by shutting down, and accepts the situation because he has learned that a response is not forthcoming. Crying is also hard, physically, on baby: it can lead to hoarseness that can last for days; the digestive system is upset; stress hormones rise; heart rates can climb to levels over 200 beats per minute; and oxygen levels in the blood are diminished.Another school of thought, which I subscribe to, discourages viewing sleep as a state you can force a baby into. Instead, its best to create a sleep-inducing environment that allows sleep to overtake the baby. The process of breastfeeding itself regulates babys temperature and heart rate and lowers his blood pressure, and puts him to sleep. This helps your baby develop a healthy attitude about sleep, where baby views sleep as a safe, comforting, natural state.Ive been told that my child will NEVER learn to go to sleep on his own if we dont teach himNever? It is normal, natural and healthy for your child to fall asleep nursing. Breastfeeding children fall asleep so quickly  how can anything so perfectly designed be worrisome? Ive read a lot about babies sleep patterns, and Ive talked to many moms about this. Both my reading, my personal experience, and the experiences of other moms has convinced me that falling asleep without breastfeeding is a developmental milestone that your child will reach when he is ready. The first step often comes when your baby starts to nurse to sleep then stops nursing, rolls away and goes to sleep on his own. Or perhaps he will fall asleep in Daddys arms when hes walking with him. These incidents may not happen very often at first, but they are the first step and do make you realize that it IS possible for your child to fall asleep by himself.There are countless numbers of children who have been nursed to sleep and nursed during the night from birth who eventually learn to fall asleep on their own without the breast. You dont have to teach them to do this. They reach this as a milestone  when theyre physically, developmentally, and emotionally ready. You can try to speed this process along by putting baby to bed before hes asleep, but always nursing him to sleep will not keep him from learning this on his own.My daughter started to occasionally fall asleep on her own (or with her Dad) when she was around 11-12 months. Knowing that she could go to sleep without me right there really helped, even though she didnt do it too often. As time passes, shes fallen asleep without nursing more and more. We did not teach her to do this, or even particularly encourage it. It has simply been a natural developmental progression that came about as she was ready for it.How will my child go to sleep when Im not there to breastfeed him, or after he weans?Many moms are worried about how their child will go to sleep when he enters daycare or weans, and feel that they must teach him to sleep independently before this time. This is really not necessary, and can add lots of stress to something that is already a big transition for your child. Children are very adaptable and will find new ways to go to sleep when mom is not there. Your child and his other caregiver(s) will work things out just fine, and they will find new ways to comfort that work great for both of them. The same will happen when your child weans.How can I gently encourage my child to fall asleep without breastfeeding (and without crying)?First, remember that if breastfeeding to sleep is not a problem for you, your child will discontinue it on his own without help from you. If youd like to try to accelerate the process, read onTry transitioning from breastfeeding your child totally to sleep, to breastfeeding him almost asleep; then to just really relaxed, and then eventually to no breastfeeding at all to go to sleep. The process may take a long time, or it may not. If youll start out taking it as gradually as you possibly can, it will probably work better and youll avoid possible problems and frustrations for both you and your baby.You might start by lying down with him in the bed he will sleep in for naps, or on the floor, etc.  wherever he will be sleeping. Dont insist that he sleep in the crib if he doesnt want to. Your goal at this point it to get him comfortable enough and secure enough to go to sleep on his own. You dont want that made more difficult by any fears of being alone in his crib.After he is okay with breastfeeding to sleep in this way, you might try nursing him till hes almost asleep; eyes closed, heavy breathing but not completely out. Then transition to nursing just till he is relaxed and settled from all the activity prior to the nursing session. When he has done well with you leaving after only nursing this long, then you can try to transition him to going to sleep entirely on his own. You might offer him a favorite toy, book, etc. Give him a kiss and a hug and tell him night night in a way that is upbeat and positive. Try to have naptime and bedtime at the same time every day with a routine that he can begin to recognize and expect. For example, have naptime every day after lunchtime or have bedtime every night after snack or bathtime. That way he knows what to expect. You might even remind him that naptime or bedtime are coming and talk excitedly about it. For an older baby or toddler, ask him what he would like to take to bed with him; talk about the place he will sleep, how nice it is, etc. Allow him to have the light on if he wishes or the door open or whatever he wants in the bed with him  dont fight him on the little things.Again, your goal is to get him to a comfortable enough place that he feels secure enough to go to sleep without nursing and by himself.My child wants to comfort nurse the entire time hes napping! How can I slip away without waking him?Its really not unusual for children to wish to breastfeed while napping. They do grow out of it eventually. There are a couple of things that you could try to help you to slip away.Depending upon how big he is, you might let him continue to sleep latched on, but have him in a carrier (sling, wrap, etc.) so you can get up and do things while he sleeps.You can also work on slipping away after your child goes to sleep. Make sure he is deeply asleep and no longer swallowing before you try this (you may have to wait a while). Hell then be doing what we sometimes call flutter sucking or comfort sucking, a really light suck. When a baby is in a light sleep, youll see facial grimaces, partially clenched fists, muscle twitches, fluttering eyelids, and overall tense muscle tone. You can recognize deep sleep by an almost motionless face, regular breathing, still eyelids, and especially the limp-limb sign  arms dangling weightlessly at babys sides, hands open and muscles relaxed.Once your child is in a deep sleep, try and slip away very slowly. One thing that sometimes helps is to slip a finger in his mouth near the nipple, then ease the nipple out so he is just sucking your finger. Then you can ease your finger out of his mouth  it helps to put a little pressure on babys bottom lip as you do this. By doing this, you can often keep baby from waking. Putting something right up next to him that has moms scent (a t-shirt, pillow, or an animal he sleeps with) also helps.My children often seem to detect the loss of body contact and warmth when I get up. As Im getting up, I keep my hand(s) on baby for a few moments, then *gradually* take them away so the transition isnt so sudden. Baby will usually stir when I get up, but often goes back to sleep if I keep my hands on him till he gets still again. If your baby is older, it can also be helpful to put a hard pillow (preferably a warm one that youve been sleeping near) beside him in the spot where you were sleeping so that he doesnt feel empty space if he reaches out in his sleep. If baby was resting his feet on me (common with mine), then Ill sometimes even put a pillow under his feet. With an older baby/toddler, I lay him down on top of my pillow if Im trying to put him down on the bed when hes already asleep. (Keep in mind that its not safe to use pillows with young babies due to SIDS risk.)Its often easier to slip away during a nap when youre both lying down. If youre nursing sitting up, the position change may be waking him  you might try nursing him on a pillow in your lap so you can just transfer him to a bed or the floor without moving him around as much (again, younger babies should not be sleeping on or near pillows). If baby wakes when you put him in his crib, you might try moving him to a baby-safe bed or pallet on the floor, instead of his crib  he might nap better in a different place.This article has additional tips for helping baby stay asleep: Let Sleeping Babies Lie  pleaseMy toddler wants to comfort nurse forever when hes trying to fall asleep.Sometimes we start to question ourselves (again, perhaps) when we have a breastfeeding toddler who wants to hang out at the breast for hours at bedtime, without ever quite falling asleep. Have you ever had one of those nights when you keep trying to slip away, thinking your toddler is asleep, to be interrupted by a sleepy protest every time you try to unlatch? The later at night it is, the more you can start to doubt yourself and wonder if they might have been right about that bad habit.Both of my kids have gone through stages of time (often teething or illness related) when they wanted to stay latched forever, but remember that these are usually just stages that come and go. If you are willing to let your toddler continue to nurse to sleep, rest assured that he will learn to fall asleep on his own, in his own time.What if the comfort nursing is becoming uncomfortable for you, or if you just feel that youd like to move away from it? If youre experiencing discomfort, pull your child closer in and check on latch and positioning  remember that even constant comfort nursing should not be uncomfortable if latch and positioning are as they should be (assuming youre not pregnant). If you feel the need to gently ease away from nursing to sleep, then go ahead and do so (see above for tips)  nursing is a two-way street and there is no reason not to have some basic age-appropriate nursing rules for toddlers. But dont feel that you need to change things just because someone wants to guilt you into it  its only a problem if its adversely affecting your family.Additional Resources@ Sleeping Through the NightCluster Feeding and Fussy EveningsFrequent NursingSafe Co-sleeping and bed-sharingNight WeaningRead excerpts from Good Nights by Jay Gordon, M.D. and Maria Goodavage (including Any ideas on how I can have a little time to myself while my baby naps?)Are you worried that you will spoil your baby?What should I know about giving my breastfed baby a pacifier?@ other websitesComfort Nursing and Nursing to Sleep5 Cool Things No One Ever Told You About Nighttime Breastfeeding from Breastfeeding ChicagoWhen They Need You to Fall Asleep: Self-Soothing and Other Myths byWendy WisnerThe Human Pacifier by Lu Hanessian, from New Beginnings Vol. 19 No. 1, January-February 2002, p. 14Nursing for Comfort by Teresa PitmanComfort versus nutrition by Kathryn OrlinskyNormal Infant Sleep: Night Nursings Importance My child only goes to sleep nursing by Darcia Narvaez, Ph.D.8 Infant Sleep Facts Every Parent Should Know from AskDrSears.comControlled CryingPosition Paper on Controlled Crying (Sleep Training) from the Australian Association for Infant Mental HealthBaby Sleep Training: Mistakes Experts and Parents Make: Advice to ignore the needs of babies byDarcia Narvaez, Ph.D.Should I let my baby cry it out? by Elizabeth PantleyControlled crying oops sorry controlled comforting by Sue Cox RN, RM, IBCLC, ABA breastfeeding counsellorStress in Infancy by Linda Folden Palmer, D.C.Letting Baby Cry-It-Out Yes, No! from AskDrSears.comThe Con of Controlled Crying by Pinky McKayCry It Out: The Potential Dangers of Leaving Your Baby to Cry by Margaret Chuong-KimMistaken Approaches to Night Wakingby Paul M.

Sleeping Through the Night,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/sleep/,"Should my baby be sleeping through the night?Its so common for mothers to worry when their babies dont sleep through the night. After all, everyone knows theyre supposed to. Some doctors recommend nighttime weaning and cry it out methods if your baby is not sleeping through the night by 6 months or even earlier. Even when the mom herself has no problems with baby nursing at night, she still worries that this is a problem, since American society seem to consider it one. There are books all over the bookstores with advice on solving so-called sleep problems.Phronsie Howell CC flickrFirst, please ignore what everyone else says about your babys sleep habits and what is normal. These people are not living with you or your baby. Unless your doctor sleeps in the next room and your baby is keeping him awake every night, he has no reason to question a healthy babys sleep habits. If you and your baby enjoy nighttime feedings, then why not continue? Its a great way to have time with her, particularly if you are apart during the day.Every baby is different, and some sleep through the night earlier than others (schedules or food usually have nothing to do with this). Your baby may be hungry (keep in mind that breastmilk digests in less than 2 hours) or she may just want time with you. Babies whose mothers work during the week often nurse more at night and on weekends, perhaps to reconnect with mom.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Many doctors tend to look at night nursing only from a nutritional standpoint, but this is only part of the story. After the first few months, your baby will begin to associate the breast with far more than just a way to satisfy hunger and thirst. It becomes a place of comfort, security, warmth, closeness, and familiarity. The act of nursing is not just nourishing; it is nurturing. Keep in mind that these needs are every bit as real as babys physical ones, and having them met is every bit as needful to babys overall development.If the amount that your child sleeps and nurses at night isnt a major problem for you, then theres no reason to try to change anything. You are NOT doing a bad thing by nursing on cue; you are doing a wonderful thing for your baby. When you comfort baby at night, you are not teaching her a bad habit: you are teaching her that you are there for her when she needs you  Is security a bad habit?What is normal when it comes to babys sleep?It is common for breastfed babies to not sleep through the night for a long period of time. On the other hand, some breastfed babies start sleeping through the night when a few months old.Both of my children nursed once (occasionally more) at night through their second year. Since this doesnt bother me, I did doing nothing to change it. We co-sleep, and neither my baby nor I generally wake up completely when she nurses. Both started sleeping through the night on their own, when they were ready.Your baby will begin to comfort herself and to sleep for longer stretches at her own developmental pace. If your baby wants to nurse at night, it is because she DOES need this, whether its because she is hungry or because she wants to be close to mom. Beginning to sleep through the night is similar to a developmental milestone (like walking or toilet training) that your baby will reach when she is ready. Trying to force baby to reach this before her time may result in other problems later on.If you can try to take a more relaxed approach and trust that it will come in time, youll see your baby eventually become a good sleeper. Youll be able to rest peacefully in your heart and mind knowing that she reached this in her own time when she felt secure enough to do so, not because he had no other choice but to quiet herself because no one would come.Probably one of the main reasons that night-waking babies are such a big issue is that parents dont have realistic expectations of the sleep patterns of babies. We are bombarded with magazine articles and books that perpetuate the myth that babies should not have nighttime needs. Babies were designed to wake up often at night to feed and cuddle keep in mind that many adults wake during the night, too. If our expectations for babies were not so different from our babies expectations for themselves, much of this problem might disappear.See Studies on normal infant sleep for more information on what is normal.Why do babies wake at night?Babies wake at night for many reasons, and they often start waking at night after sleeping through for a few weeks or months. Some of the reasons for night waking (in no particular order) are:baby wants more time with momteethingdevelopmental advances (for example: waking more often right before or after learning to turn over, crawl or talk)illness, allergy, diaper rash, eczemahunger (including growth spurts)reverse cycling: Some babies whose moms are away during the day prefer to reject most/all supplements while mom is away, and nurse often during the evening and night. If mom is very busy during the day or if baby is very distracted, this can also lead to reverse cycling.When your child nurses more often at night, go through this checklist to see if you can figure out what might be going on. Sometimes there may be more than one thing causing the night waking.What about giving formula or solids at night to help baby sleep better?See Will giving formula or solids at night help baby sleep better?Gentle methods for encouraging less night nursingSee Night Weaning, which also includes many suggestions for maximizing sleep in younger babies who still need to breastfeed frequently.Does night waking last forever?Remember that night waking in babies and young children is normal and temporary!Children grow out of night waking, even when we do nothing to discourage it. This period of time will be a very tiny part of your childs years with you.Your goal is to maximize sleep for everyone in the family, while respecting the needs of your child.If youre meeting this goal, then ignore anyone who suggests that you do things differently. If your sleep situation is not working (or stops working) then you can always do things differently. All parents find that they change the way they do things as their child grows older and reaches different developmental stages  sleep is just another thing that changes as your child grows.More information@ Wakeful 4 month olds by Jan Barger, RN, MA, IBCLCStudies on normal infant sleepNight WeaningNursing to Sleep and Other Comfort NursingThe Family BedWhat is normal when it comes to night waking?Do Older Babies Need NightFeedings? by Nancy Mohrbacher, IBCLC, FILCAThe myth of baby sleep regressions  whats really happening to your babys sleep? byPinky McKay, IBCLCIs Your Baby Sleeping Through the Night Yet? by Jennifer Rebecca Thomas, MD, FAAP, IBCLC5 Cool Things No One Ever Told You About Nighttime Breastfeedingfrom Breastfeeding ChicagoNight Waking: or, Will I Ever Get A Good Nights Sleep Again? by Anne Smith, IBCLCPillow Talk: Helping your Child Get a Good Nights Sleep By Paul M.

“Is it for me?” Tips for Making Your Decision about Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Tandem Nursing,http://kellymom.com/ages/tandem/tandempregnancytips/,"Published as Pregnant                 and Tandem Nursing by Hilary Flower   in Mothering, Issue 118, May/June 2003Like most aspects of mothering small children, tandem nursing is               an adventure. Here are some tips: Find some other tandem mamas. Hearing about a range of experiences                 can help you decide if tandem nursing might be for you, and a support                 network of tandem mamas will serve you well as you go along. One                 place to start is your La Leche League group. You can find local                 groups internationally at www.lalecheleague.org.

Breastfeeding your older child                 can help you make the most of couch-bound motheringa much-needed                 energy-saver if youre battling pregnancy fatigue or caring for                 a newbornbut good self-care is essential.Expect changes. Pregnancy has a tendency to lead to weaning, especially if nursing becomes  painful or your milk supplies dwindle. Children have also been known to abruptly self-wean at  the birth of the babyor to turn around and un-wean when the milk comes in and begin nursing  again like newborns. Then again, through it all, some nurslings dont skip a beat.When considering the safety of overlapping breastfeeding with your pregnancy, a  breastfeeding-friendly midwife or obstetrician can make a huge difference. We still lack  sufficient medical research to make definitive guidelines, although the research we do have is  encouraging for well-nourished mothers. The American Academy of Family Physicians asserts  that breastfeeding during a healthy pregnancy is a personal decision for the motherindeed,  that weaning before two years of age can increase a childs risk of illness. Remember to ask  yourself: Does this overlap feel harmonious within my body?Have realistic expectations. Breastfeeding your older child can offer many gifts after a new  baby joins the family, but tandem nursing can at times be stressful or difficult.

A New Look at the Safety of Breastfeeding During Pregnancy,http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-preg/bfpregnancy_safety/,"by Hilary Dervin Flower, MARead article in GermanIntroductionBreastfeeding and contractionsThe well-protected uterusA balanced approachExtra: A primer on the signs of preterm laborReferences citedAre you ready to try to conceive your second child, but still enjoying a breastfeeding relationship with your firstborn? Or perhaps you are breastfeeding your child over a kicking baby belly? If so you are not alonefar from it. In a study of 179 mothers who had breastfed for at least six months, 61% had also breastfed during a subsequent pregnancy.1 Of these, 38% went on to nurse both newborn and toddler postpartum, an arrangement known as tandem nursing.If you are eager to avoid unnecessary weaning, you have good reason. Human milk provides important nutritional and immunological boosts for as long as a child nurses. Indeed, weaning before the age of two has been found to raise a childs risk of illness.2 American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a minimum of one year of breastfeeding, and the World Health Organization calls for two years or more. Moreover, continued breastfeeding can be helpful to your toddlers adjustment to a new baby. Besides, what better way to rest your tired pregnant body while caring for an active baby or toddler?In contemplating the healthiness of an overlap you will want to consider how breastfeeding is fitting in with your needs for rest, adequate pregnancy weight gain, and your overall sense of well-being. You will do well to take into account that breastfeeding can be painful or agitating for many mothers for some or all of pregnancy, leading some mothers to push for weaning. The milk tends to dwindle by mid-pregnancy, some children self-wean in response, while others dont seem to care.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Another concern you may have is the fact that breastfeeding causes contractions. Could breastfeeding trigger preterm labor or miscarriage? I have dug deep in the scientific literature and interviewed over 200 mothers, seeking hard facts to help mothers make the most informed and balanced assessment they can of this important safety question. Indeed, this question was my top priority as I researched my new book Adventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding during Pregnancy and Beyond, published in July 2003 by La Leche League International. Heres what I learned.Breastfeeding and contractionsNipple stimulation releases the hormone oxytocin into the bloodstream. Oxytocin is important for breastfeeding because it is the chemical messenger that tells breast tissue to contract and eject milk (the milk ejection reflex). Oxytocin also tells the uterine tissue to contract. All women experience uterine contractions during breastfeeding, although they are usually too mild to be noticed. Nipple stimulation can be used to ripen the cervix when a woman is at term, and can also augment labor after it is underway. Postpartum breastfeeding efficiently shrinks the uterus back to pre-pregnancy-size.Given these associations, it seems a short jump to guess that breastfeeding might trigger labor before its time. This question deserves medical study, and it is important to bear in mind that at this time we do not have one. At the same time, preliminary data do suggest that breastfeeding and healthy term births are quite compatible. Sherrill Mosconas 1993 survey of 57 California mothers who breastfed during pregnancy concluded that breastfeeding resulted in no apparent adverse consequences to the mothers pregnancies.3 There are also countless anecdotal reports of mothers who have breastfed throughout pregnancy have given birth to healthy term babies. Of course, some pregnancies are not destined to proceed as we hope, whether the mother is breastfeeding or not, and so breastfeeding mothers have suffered their share of preterm labor and miscarriage as well.Most mothers notice no contractions during breastfeeding, even during pregnancy (93% in the Moscona survey).3 Interestingly, even those who experience intense nursing contractions often find that the contractions cease soon after ending the breastfeeding session.3,4 Like Braxton-Hicks contractions, nursing contractions commonly occur without disrupting the pregnancy. How might that work? The scientific literature has a lot to tell us about that.The well-protected uterusThe specter of breastfeeding-induced preterm labor appears to spring in large part from an incomplete understanding of the interactions between nipple stimulation, oxytocin, and pregnancy.The first little-known fact is that during pregnancy less oxytocin is released in response to nipple stimulation than when a woman is not pregnant.5But the key to understanding breastfeeding during pregnancy is the uterus itself. Contrary to popular belief, the uterus is not at the beck and call of oxytocin during the 38 weeks of the preterm period. Even a high dose of synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) is unlikely to trigger labor until a woman is at term.6Instead, the uterus must actively prepare in order for labor to commence. You could say that there are two separate states of being for the uterus: the quiescent baby-holder and the active baby-birther. These states make all the difference to how the uterus responds to oxytocin, and so, one can surmise, to breastfeeding. While the baby is growing, the uterus is geared to have a muffled response to oxytocin; at term, the bodys preparations for labor transform the uterus in ways that make it respond intensely to oxytocin.Many discussions of breastfeeding during pregnancy mention oxytocin receptor sites, the uterine cells that detect the presence of oxytocin and cause a contraction. These cells are sparse up until 38 weeks, increasing gradually after that time, and increasing 300-fold after labor has begun.6,7 The relative scarcity of oxytocin receptor sites is one of the main lines of defense for keeping the uterus quiescent throughout the entire preterm periodbut it is not the only one.A closer look at the molecular biology of the pregnant uterus reveals yet more lines of defense. In order for oxytocin receptor sites to respond strongly to oxytocin they need the help of special agents called gap junction proteins. The absence of these proteins renders the uterus down-regulated, relatively insensitive to oxytocin even when the oxytocin receptor site density is high. And natural oxytocin-blockers, most notably progesterone, stand between oxytocin and its receptor site throughout pregnancy. 8,9,10With the oxytocin receptor sites (1) sparse, (2) down-regulated, and (3) blocked by progesterone and other anti-oxytocin agents, oxytocin alone cannot trigger labor. The uterus is in baby-holding mode, well protected from untimely labor.4A balanced approachOnly direct research can definitively tell us whether breastfeeding can elevate the risk of preterm labor or miscarriage in any woman. But as you can see, the available research gives us valid reasons to doubt that breastfeeding could trigger labor before the body has already begun to prepare for it. With increasing first-hand experience among health professionals, many well-respected sources are asserting that breastfeeding is safe in healthy pregnancies, including Ina May Gaskin, LM,4 the American Academy of Family Physicians,11 and Ruth Lawrence, MD, in Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession.12Complicated pregnancies always call for more complicated decisions, but weaning can still be avoided in many cases. I have corresponded with many mothers who breastfed through high risk pregnancies, even threatened preterm labor, and have given birth to healthy term babies.4 Sometimes reduced nursing or weaning seems to be for the best; no two mothers choices are the same.You may wish to work with your caregiver to draw up a plan for moving forward with your eyes open. As in any pregnancy, you should be on the look out for signs of preterm labor. Any mother who is experiencing contractions that concern her should end the breastfeeding session and see if the contractions stop as well. Some caregivers judge that it is helpful to observe the affects of breastfeeding on uterine contractility, fetal heart rate, or the state of the cervix.In closing, I would like to share a bit of my own story. When I became pregnant with my second child, I worried that breastfeeding might interfere with my healthy pregnancy. My midwives Anne Hirsch, LM, and CharLynn Daughtry, LM, CPM, were accustomed to supporting breastfeeding mothers. They provided me with the support I needed to hold onto my breastfeeding relationship with my two-year-old Nora Jade. What a difference it made. After I gave birth to Miles at home, my daughter rushed in to meet her brother, and she immediately wanted to nurse with him. That na-na is for brother, she said. As they nursed and gazed at each other wide-eyed across my chest, I wrapped an arm around each of them, marveling at my bodys powers to provide.When deciding about the health of breastfeeding during pregnancy, each mother must sort through her options, her feelings, and what her own body is telling her. Trust yourself to make the best choice for your family.A primer on the signs of preterm laborRemember to contact your caregiver immediately if you experience any of these possible warning signs:Four or more uterine contractions in an hourentire uterus is tight, hard, balled up to the touch; may or may not feel painfulLow backachePelvic pressureCramping (like menstrual cramps)Increased vaginal discharge, which may include mucus, blood, or waterIf these signs occur (or any contractions concern you) during a breastfeeding session, end the session. It is important to remember that breastfeeding can cause contractions, and, like Braxton-Hicks, these contractions do not automatically mean you are going into labor.If you have stopped nursingor werent nursing at that particular timeand you are still having or think you are having more than two or three contractions an hour, you should:Begin timing how often one occurs and how long each lasts.Empty your bladder.Drink a large glass of water (dehydration can sometimes lead to contractions).Lie on your left side, or recline with feet elevated, consciously relaxing.And again, if after this you find you are having four or more contractions in an hour, you should call your prenatal care provider immediately.AUTHOR BIOHilary Flower lives in Florida with her 3 children.

I am delighted to have been asked to comment specifically on the risks of miscarriage for a breastfeeding woman. Hilary Flower has provided a detailed explanation that is easily accessible to the lay person, as to why the normal pregnant uterus only responds weakly to the action of oxytocin hormone until the very end of pregnancy. Undoubtedly, this is one of natures own safety checks to prevent miscarriage and preterm labour in women continuing to breastfeed regularly during their next pregnancy. I feel sure that this book will provide women with confidence and reassurance to believe that breast is best for their baby.Lesley Regan, PhD, MDHead of the Recurrent Miscarriage Clinic at St. Marys Hospital in London, the largest miscarriage referral unit in Europe, and author of Miscarriage: What every woman should knowAdventures in Tandem Nursing is a rare gema book that reassures, informs, and entertains simultaneously.

How Breast Milk Protects Newborns,http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/how_breastmilk_protects_newborns/,"Written by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPCSome of the molecules and cells in human milk actively help infants stave off infection.Doctors have long known that infants who are breast-fed contract fewer infections than do those who are given formula. Until fairly recently, most physicians presumed that breast-fed children fared better simply because milk supplied directly from the breast is free of bacteria. Formula, which must often be mixed with water and placed in bottles, can become contaminated easily. Yet even infants who receive sterilized formula suffer from more meningitis and infection of the gut, ear, respiratory tract and urinary tract than do breast-fed youngsters.The reason, it turns out, is that mothers milk actively helps newborns avoid disease in a variety of ways. Such assistance is particularly beneficial during the first few months of life, when an infant often cannot mount an effective immune response against foreign organisms. And although it is not the norm in most industrial cultures, UNICEF and the World Health Organization both advise breast-feeding to two years and beyond. Indeed, a childs immune response does not reach its full strength until age five or so.All human babies receive some coverage in advance of birth. During pregnancy, the mother passes antibodies to her fetus through the placenta. These proteins circulate in the infants blood for weeks to months after birth, neutralizing microbes or marking them for destruction by phagocytes-immune cells that consume and break down bacteria, viruses and cellular debris. But breast-fed infants gain extra protection from antibodies, other proteins and immune cells in human milk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Once ingested, these molecules and cells help to prevent microorganisms from penetrating the bodys tissues. Some of the molecules bind to microbes in the hollow space (lumen) of the gastrointestinal tract. In this way, they block microbes from attaching to and crossing through the mucosa-the layer of cells, also known as the epithelium, that lines the digestive tract and other body cavities. Other molecules lessen the supply of particular minerals and vitamins that harmful bacteria need to survive in the digestive tract. Certain immune cells in human milk are phagocytes that attack microbes directly. Another set produces chemicals that invigorate the infants own immune response.Breast Milk AntibodiesAntibodies, which are also called immunoglobulins, take five basic forms, denoted as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE. All have been found in human milk, but by far the most abundant type is IgA, specifically the form known as secretory IgA, which is found in great amounts throughout the gut and respiratory system of adults. These antibodies consist of two joined IgA molecules and a so-called secretory component that seems to shield the antibody molecules from being degraded by the gastric acid and digestive enzymes in the stomach and intestines. Infants who are bottle-fed have few means for battling ingested pathogens until they begin making secretory IgA on their own, often several weeks or even months after birth.The secretory IgA molecules passed to the suckling child are helpful in ways that go beyond their ability to bind to microorganisms and keep them away from the bodys tissues. First, the collection of antibodies transmitted to an infant is highly targeted against pathogens in that childs immediate surroundings. The mother synthesizes antibodies when she ingests, inhales or otherwise comes in contact with a disease-causing agent. Each antibody she makes is specific to that agent; that is, it binds to a single protein, or antigen, on the agent and will not waste time attacking irrelevant substances. Because the mother makes antibodies only to pathogens in her environment, the baby receives the protection it most needs-against the infectious agents it is most likely to encounter in the first weeks of life.Second, the antibodies delivered to the infant ignore useful bacteria normally found in the gut. This flora serves to crowd out the growth of harmful organisms, thus providing another measure of resistance. Researchers do not yet know how the mothers immune system knows to make antibodies against only pathogenic and not normal bacteria, but whatever the process may be, it favors the establishment of good bacteria in a babys gut.Secretory IgA molecules further keep an infant from harm in that, unlike most other antibodies, they ward off disease without causing inflammation-a process in which various chemicals destroy microbes but potentially hurt healthy tissue. In an infants developing gut, the mucosal membrane is extremely delicate, and an excess of these chemicals can do considerable damage. Interestingly, secretory IgA can probably protect mucosal surfaces other than those in the gut. In many countries, particularly in the Middle East, western South America and northern Africa, women put milk in their infants eyes to treat infections there. I do not know if this remedy has ever been tested scientifically, but there are theoretical reasons to believe it would work. It probably does work at least some of the time, or the practice would have died out.An Abundance of Helpful MoleculesSeveral molecules in human milk besides secretory IgA prevent microbes from attaching to mucosal surfaces. Oligosaccharides, which are simple chains of sugars, often contain domains that resemble the binding sites through which bacteria gain entry into the cells lining the intestinal tract. Thus, these sugars can intercept bacteria, forming harmless complexes that the baby excretes. In addition, human milk contains large molecules called mucins that include a great deal of protein and carbohydrate. They, too, are capable of adhering to bacteria and viruses and eliminating them from the body.The molecules in milk have other valuable functions as well. Each molecule of a protein called lactoferrin, for example, can bind to two atoms of iron. Because many pathogenic bacteria thrive on iron, lactoferrin halts their spread by making iron unavailable. It is especially effective at stalling the proliferation of organisms that often cause serious illness in infants, including Staphylococcus aureus. Lactoferrin also disrupts the process by which bacteria digest carbohydrates, further limiting their growth. Similarly, B12 binding protein, as its name suggests, deprives microorganisms of vitamin B12. Bifidus factor, one of the oldest known disease-resistance factors in human milk, promotes the growth of a beneficial organism named Lactobacillus bifidus. Free fatty acids present in milk can damage the membranes of enveloped viruses, such as the chicken pox virus, which are packets of genetic material encased in protein shells. Interferon, found particularly in colostrum-the scant, sometimes yellowish milk a mother produces during the first few days after birth-also has strong antiviral activity. And fibronectin, present in large quantities in colostrum, can make certain phagocytes more aggressive so that they will ingest microbes even when the microbes have not been tagged by an antibody. Like secretory IgA, fibronectin minimizes inflammation; it also seems to aid in repairing tissue damaged by inflammation.Cellular DefensesAs is true of defensive molecules, immune cells are abundant in human milk. They consist of white blood cells, or leukocytes, that fight infection themselves and activate other defense mechanisms. The most impressive amount is found in colostrum. Most of the cells are neutrophils, a type of phagocyte that normally circulates in the bloodstream. Some evidence suggests that neutrophils continue to act as phagocytes in the infants gut. Yet they are less aggressive than blood neutrophils and virtually disappear from breast milk six weeks after birth. So perhaps they serve some other function, such as protecting the breast from infection.The next most common milk leukocyte is the macrophage, which is phagocytic like neutrophils and performs a number of other protective functions. Macrophages make up some 40 percent of all the leukocytes in colostrum. They are far more active than milk neutrophils, and recent experiments suggest that they are more motile than are their counterparts in blood. Aside from being phagocytic, the macrophages in breast milk manufacture lysozyme, increasing its amount in the infants gastrointestinal tract. Lysozyme is an enzyme that destroys bacteria by disrupting their cell walls.In addition, macrophages in the digestive tract can rally lymphocytes into action against invaders. Lymphocytes constitute the remaining 10 percent of white cells in the milk. About 20 percent of these cells are B lymphocytes, which give rise to antibodies; the rest are T lymphocytes, which kill infected cells directly or send out chemical messages that mobilize still other components of the immune system. Milk lymphocytes seem to behave differently from blood lymphocytes. Those in milk, for example, proliferate in the presence of Escherichia coli, a bacterium that can cause life-threatening illness in babies, but they are far less responsive than blood lymphocytes to agents posing less threat to infants. Milk lymphocytes also manufacture several chemicals-including gamma-interferon, migration inhibition factor and monocyte chemotactic factor-that can strengthen an infants own immune response.Added BenefitsSeveral studies indicate that some factors in human milk may induce an infants immune system to mature more quickly than it would were the child fed artificially. For example, breast-fed babies produce higher levels of antibodies in response to immunizations. Also, certain hormones in milk (such as cortisol) and smaller proteins (including epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, insulinlike growth factor and somatomedin C) act to close up the leaky mucosal lining of the newborn, making it relatively impermeable to unwanted pathogens and other potentially harmful agents. Indeed, animal studies have demonstrated that postnatal development of the intestine occurs faster in animals fed their mothers milk. And animals that also receive colostrum, containing the highest concentrations of epidermal growth factor, mature even more rapidly.Other unknown compounds in human milk must stimulate a babys own production of secretory IgA, lactoferrin and lysozyme. All three molecules are found in larger amounts in the urine of breast-fed babies than in that of bottle-fed babies. Yet breast-fed babies cannot absorb these molecules from human milk into their gut. It would appear that the molecules must be produced in the mucosa of the youngsters urinary tract. In other words, it seems that breast-feeding induces local immunity in the urinary tract.In support of this notion, recent clinical studies have demonstrated that the breast-fed infant has a lower risk of acquiring urinary tract infections. Finally, some evidence also suggests that an unknown factor in human milk may cause breast-fed infants to produce more fibronectin on their own than do bottle-fed babies.All things considered, breast milk is truly a fascinating fluid that supplies infants with far more than nutrition. It protects them against infection until they can protect themselves.Further ReadingSlade HB, Schwartz SA.

Natural treatments for nursing moms,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/natural-treatments/,"Although many medications are compatible with breastfeeding, its always a good idea to minimize the use of medications when nursing. Following are various natural treatments for nursing moms that I have collected.Keep in mind that herbal and other natural treatments in general are not without risk for nursing moms  herbs can be just as pharmacologically active as meds from the pharmacy. Before using any herbal treatment, investigate whether it is safe for nursing moms.Birth Control: Can breastfeeding be used to prevent pregnancy?Cold & Allergy: Natural remediesDehydration: Oral rehydration formula recipesEngorgement Cabbage Fenugreek seed poultice Juice Jar breast pump Reverse Pressure SofteningHomeopathic remediesItchy nipples: Vinegar rinseLow milk supply How to increase Associated with menstruation Herbal remediesMastitis: Non-antibiotic treatmentMigraine: Natural TreatmentsOil of Oregano for thrush?Plugged milk duct Lecithin PotatoSore nipples Tea bags Broken skin on the nipple During ovulation: Evening primrose oilToo much milk: Sage and other herbsThrush: Links to various natural treatmentsAdditional InformationNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Dehydration: Oral Rehydration Formula RecipesFor adults, lost fluids and electrolytes can be replaced with virtually any beverage plus a source of sodium chloride (salted crackers, etc.), or you can use an oral rehydration formula. For children and babies who are no longer nursing, a commercial rehydration formula (like Pedialyte) is generally recommended. For nursing babies and children, breastmilk is best.Here is a recipe to make an electrolyte replacement fluid [source: Diarrhea from the U.S. Pharmacist website]: teaspoon salt1 teaspoon baking soda8 teaspoons sugar8 ounces orange juiceDilute to 1 liter with water[top]Homeopathic remediesAlthough there is little  if any  professional literature in this field on the use of homeopathic medicine, my reading and research has led me to the conclusion that these remedies pose minimal  if any  risk to the nursing baby. Homeopathic remedies are reportedly very safe for nursing moms and babies because the remedies (by definition of homeopathy) contain only very dilute versions of the active substances. Many lactation consultants have used or recommended homeopathic remedies to their clients.Most experts believe that homeopathic remedies are unlikely to pose a problem for the nursing baby and mother.[top]Itchy nipples: Vinegar rinseMix 1 tablespoon white vinegar with about a cup of water. Lean over the cup and soak nipple in it for a minute or so, then stand over the sink and pour it slowly over the nipple. This can bring immediate relief. If you have itchy nipples, keep in mind that you might have thrush.[top]Low milk supply associated with menstruation: Calcium/magnesium supplementSome women experience a drop in milk supply from ovulation (mid-cycle) until the first day or two of the next menstrual period. A womans blood calcium levels gradually decrease during this period of time, and for some women the drop in blood calcium causes a drop in milk supply. For women who have this problem, calcium/magnesium supplements may be helpful. This practice has also been reported to eliminate most uterine cramping and some premenstrual discomfort such as water retention.The recommended calcium supplement dosage is between 500 mg calcium/250 mg magnesium and 1500 mg calcium/750 mg magnesium (the higher dosage is generally more effective). Calcium dosages this high should not be taken alone, but as a calcium/magnesium (or calcium/magnesium/zinc) combination. Otherwise the calcium will not be adequately absorbed into your body. The amount of supplement depends on the composition of your diet  the more animal protein, the more calcium/magnesium needed. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, the lower dosage may work fine for you. If you supplement more than 500 mg calcium per day, then divide the dose so youre not taking it all at once  calcium absorption is best when a person consumes no more than 500 mg at one time.Start the supplement when you ovulate, and continue through the first few days of your menstrual period. If periods are irregular, then begin calcium/magnesium at 14 days after the beginning of your last menstrual cycle, or simply take the supplement every day.[top]Mastitis: a non-antibiotic treatmentTake moms and babys clothes off, get into bed and nurse, nurse, nurse (mastitis appears to be the bodys way of telling mom to SLOW DOWN). Get as much rest as possible.Between feedings, use a cold compress on the breast to help with any inflammation. Some moms use hot compresses directly before nursing, but others prefer to stick to the cold. Compresses/poultices that can be helpful:Make a rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) infusion: to make an infusion, add 2-4 teaspoons of fresh or dried rosemary to a cup of boiling water. Infuse (steep) for 10 minutes, then strain.Use a fenugreek seed poultice;Make a dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) compress: boil about an ounce of minced dandelion root in two to three cups of water until only half the liquid remains; use compresses of the resulting brew.When your baby nurses on the affected side (use that side first), massage the breast towards the nipple. Massage the breast often during feedings and between feedings to help loosen the plugged area.If there is a fever, mom can takeProbiotic supplementsSeveral studies have shown thatprobiotic supplements (certainLactobacillus strains) are effectivein treatinginfectious mastitis and also resulted in a lower occurrence of repeat mastitis compared to antibiotic treatment.Raw garlic At least 2-3 raw cloves per day, 4-5 cloves a day if possible. Chop a clove into 5 or 6 pieces and then swallow the pieces whole like pills.Raw garlic acts as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, without the added antibiotic side effects of the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, or the development of yeast infections or thrush. The antimicrobial property in garlic, allicin, is very sensitive to heat and is destroyed when cooked. In order for it to work, it needs to be raw. Swallowing the cloves with orange juice helps with the taste for some. Allicin is also what gives garlic its pungent odor, so the deodorized garlic capsules that some companies offer are essentially useless, if they are being taken for the antimicrobial properties. However, deodorized garlic is still beneficial for its blood pressure reducing properties and for stimulating the immune system.Tincture of echinacea, 3-4 times/dayTincture of Oregon grape root, 3-4 times a dayVitamin C (3000-5000 mg/day megadose)Another option: Mix a dropperful of echinacea tincture, three cloves of raw garlic and four to six ounces of carrot juice in a blender and drink the mixture every two hours.A very warm shower can help  let the water just run over your breast.You can also take ibuprofen, which will help with inflammation and pain.If the mastitis does not improve or gets worse after using this treatment for 24-48 hours, contact your doctor  you may need antibiotic treatment.More information on treating mastitis can be found here: Mastitis and Plugged Ducts[top]Migraine: Natural TreatmentIve collected a few suggestions that are reported to be helpful for migraines:Cayenne Pepper:Taking cayenne inside the nose helps to open up the blood vessels. This enables the blood to get nutrients to all parts of the brain. Warning  this can burn a bit, so keep the grains of cayenne down to as few as possible.To stop a migraine follow these simple steps:Open the capsule and dip the flat end of a dry toothpick into the cayenne to pick up 3-4 grains.Block one nostril and gently put cayenne up the other nostril.Sniff deeply 3-4 times until you feel the flecks of pepper in your throat. (If you dont feel this, do it again).Once you feel the warmth in your throat, you headache should be gone in minutesOther suggestions:Taking 500 mg of magnesium per day and increasing your water intake to 8-10 glasses per day can be helpful. One person reported that her migraines were still coming at the time they usually did (during her cycle), but were much less intense and went away faster.Another person resolved her migraine problem by eliminating ALL animal fat the week before menstruation (skim milk, non-fat yogurt ok), and adding evening primrose oil to her diet.If you feel that you need migraine meds, keep in mind that a number of migraine meds are considered compatible with breastfeeding, including Sumatriptan (Imitrex).Here are a couple of outside links:Natural Migraine Treatment FAQ.

Warm water dips (or saline dips), breastmilk, medical-grade lanolin (Lansinoh, etc.) and hydrogel dressings are more commonly used to treat sore nipples. Any time that mom has sore nipples, the cause of the soreness should also be addressed. Studies are conflicting on whether tea bags are helpful for reducing the pain of sore nipples (Riordan 2005). The tannic acid in the tea (which has astrigent qualities) can cause drying and cracking (Lawrence 2005), and anecdotal evidence suggests that some babies do not suck as well after tea bags have been used.In some locations, wet tea bags remain a popular folk remedy for the treatment of nipple pain. They are inexpensive and can be found in most homes, making them easily accessible at the onset of difficulties. They may be soothing because of the moist warmth. Tea bags have been the subject of a number of studies; they appear neither to prevent nor reduce nipple soreness (Lavergne 1997). Furthermore, the tannic acid in the tea can act as an astringent causing drying and cracking, rather than healing. from Nipple Pain: Causes, Treatments, and Remedies by Jahaan MartinBuchko BL, Pugh LC, Bishop BA, Cochran JF, Smith LR, Lerew DJ.

It is reported useful for nursing moms who are trying to conceive. It is also reported useful for treating postpartum depression, sore nipples during ovulation, PMS, fibrocystic breasts, Raynauds syndrome and plugged ducts. EPO is derived from Oenothera biennis seeds and is an excellent source of essential fatty acids and their more complex metabolites GLA ( gamma linoleic acid). The suggested dosages that I have seen vary from 500-6500 mg per day for various problems: 500 mg per day has been suggested for breastfeeding moms with sore nipples during ovulation; 1000 mg 3 times a day for PMS or fibrocystic breasts. According to Hale, overt toxicity of this product appears to be quite low. No pediatric concerns have been reported. The Botanical Safety Handbook regards EPO as safe when used appropriately. Overdoses of essential fatty acids have been known to provoke gall bladder attacks.[top]Additional InformationNatural Remedies for Labour and Postpartum by Stacelynn Caughlan, Cl.N., C.H., R.N.C.Disclaimer: Most herbal treatments have not been thoroughly researched, particularly in regard to lactation.

Breastfeeding and Vaccines,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/meds/vaccines-bf/,"Vaccines in generalBreastfeeding does not affect the safety of vaccinations for mom or baby.Although breastfeeding passes many immune factors to baby, breastfeeding should not be considered a substitute for immunization. Research indicates that when breastfed babies are vaccinated, they will produce higher levels of antibodies in comparison to formula fed babies.According to the US Centers for Disease Control document General Recommendations on Immunization (February 8, 2002) [PDF version for printing]:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Neither inactivated nor live vaccines administered to a lactating woman affect the safety of breast-feeding for mothers or infants. Breast-feeding does not adversely affect immunization and is not a contraindication for any vaccine. Limited data indicate that breast-feeding can enhance the response to certain vaccine antigens. Breast-fed infants should be vaccinated according to routine recommended schedules.Although live vaccines multiply within the mothers body, the majority have not been demonstrated to be excreted in human milk. Although rubella vaccine virus might be excreted in human milk, the virus usually does not infect the infant. If infection does occur, it is well-tolerated because the viruses are attenuated. Inactivated, recombinant, subunit, polysaccharide, conjugate vaccines and toxoids pose no risk for mothers who are breast-feeding or for their infants.Information on specific vaccinesAnthrax VaccinePer the US Centers for Disease Control document Use of Anthrax Vaccine in the United States (December 15, 2000):No data suggest increased risk for side effects or temporally related adverse events associated with receipt of anthrax vaccine by breast-feeding women or breast-fed children. Administration of nonlive vaccines (e.g., anthrax vaccine) during breast-feeding is not medically contraindicated.CDC Update: Interim Recommendations for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis for Children and Breastfeeding Mothers and Treatment of Children with Anthrax (November 16, 2001) discusses the use of antibiotics for prevention of anthrax in breastfeeding mothers and children.Chicken Pox VaccineWhether attenuated vaccine VZV is excreted in human milk and, if so, whether the infant could be infected are not known. Most live vaccines have not been demonstrated to be secreted in breast milk. Attenuated rubella vaccine virus has been detected in breast milk but has produced only asymptomatic infection in the nursing infant. Therefore, varicella vaccine may be considered for a nursing mother. ACIP, Prevention of Varicella, pp. 19-20.Flu VaccineMany moms wonder specifically about the flu vaccine. This, like other vaccines, can be administered to nursing mothers. According to Prevention and Control of Influenza: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), from the US Centers for Disease Control:Influenza vaccine does not affect the safety of mothers who are breastfeeding or their infants. Breastfeeding does not adversely affect the immune response and is not a contraindication for vaccination.There are currently two forms of the flu vaccine:The intranasal (nasal mist) form of the influenza vaccine (trade-name FluMist) is an attenuated (weakened) live vaccine. It is approved for use only in healthy people between the ages of 5 and 49 years. Per the CDC, The current estimated risk of getting infected with vaccine virus after close contact with a person vaccinated with the nasal-spray flu vaccine is low (0.6%-2.4%).The standard, injectable form of the flu vaccine is an inactivated (killed) vaccine.The CDC indicates that either form of the vaccine is acceptable for a breastfeeding mother, as long as she otherwise meets requirements for receiving the vaccine.US Centers for Disease Control has general information on the current Flu Season and the CDC maintains a Weekly Flu Map for the US.See also:Flu injections and breastfeeding by Wendy Jones PhD, MRPharmSMMR VaccinePer the US Centers for Disease Control document Measles  Q&A about Disease & Vaccine:Breast feeding does not interfere with the response to MMR vaccine, and your baby will not be affected by the vaccine through your breast milk.Smallpox VaccineThe US Centers for Disease Control, recommends that breastfeeding mothers not get the smallpox vaccination. There is no evidence that vaccinia virus is transmitted in breast milk (see the above CDC information on vaccinations in general). However, the concern is that the breastfed baby, due to close proximity to the mother, might come into physical contact with the vaccination site. Note that current guidelines recommend that any person who has been vaccinated with this vaccine (breastfeeding or not) avoid close physical contact with babies under a year old for 2-3 weeks (until the scab falls off)  this would presumably affect all parents who hold, feed, care for, cuddle or sleep with their babies.Following are US Military guidelines for preventing exposure to the vaccinia virus via contact with the vaccination site. Per the US Military Clinical Policy for the DoD Smallpox Vaccination Program (Nov. 26, 2002) [from pp. 5-6 Care of the Vaccination Site]:Vaccinia virus can be cultured from the site of primary vaccination beginning at the time of development of a papule (i.e., two to five days after vaccination) until the scab separates from the skin lesion (i.e., 14 to 21 days after vaccination). During that time, case must be taken to prevent spread of the virus to another area of the body or to another persion by inadvertant contact. Disease transmission from intact scabs is unlikely, but high-risk individuals may be vulnerable to scab particles. Historically, the rate of spread of vaccinia virus to contacts is quite rare, about 27 cases per million vaccinations.The most important measure to prevent inadvertent contact spread from smallpox vaccination sites is thorough hand washing (e.g., alcohol-based waterless antiseptic solution, soap and water) after any touching of the vaccination site.Minimizing close physical contact with infants less than one year of age is prudent until the scab falls off. If unable to avoid infant contact, wash hands before handling an infant (e.g., feeding, changing diapers) and ensure that the vaccination site is covered with a porus bandage and clothing. It is preferable to have someone else handle the infant. Smallpox vaccine is not recommended for use in a nursing mother in non-emergency situations.Smallpox Vaccine: Pregnancy and Breastfeeding from the CDCCDC Smallpox InformationUS Military information on smallpox vaccinationGeneral Smallpox InformationSigns and Symptoms of Smallpox by Dana D.

Do mom’s vaccines protect her breastfed baby?,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/meds/vaccine-protection/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCMany moms wonder whether their babies will be protected from any illness that mom has been immunized against as long as breastfeeding continues. Breastfeeding will enhance babys response to immunizations that he receives, however, breastfeeding will not act as a substitute for immunization.The immunities that our bodies generate when we get an illness or receive a vaccination are IgG immunities. IgG is the major immunoglobulin circulating in the blood and is the type of antibody that provides long-term resistance to illnesses  the IgG antibodies recognize germs that weve been exposed to previously so that they can be destroyed more quickly.IgG protection from mom primarily comes to her baby via the placenta prior to birth this maternal IgG in babys system gradually disappears by 6-8 months postpartum. A childs own IgG synthesis gradually increases until it reaches adult levels by 7-8 years of age [ref: Behrman: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 16th ed., Copyright  2000 W. B. Saunders Company. p. 595]. The child continues to get some IgG protection from breastmilk for as long as nursing continues, but IgG does not enter the breastmilk in quantities high enough to vaccinate baby (though its certainly helpful).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Immunities that babies receive from nursing are primarily IgA (IgG and other immunoglobulins are present in much lower quantities). IgA concentrates in body fluids such as tears, saliva, and the secretions of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and has an important protective function.The many immune components in breastmilk can make a huge difference when it comes to keeping baby healthy. Even though baby does not receive enough of moms IgG immunities via breastmilk to qualify as an immunization against a particular illness, there are many other immunities (IgA, certain fatty acids, etc) in the breastmilk that are active against the same illnesses.As an example, what protection does baby get from the chicken pox (varicella) virus if mom had chicken pox as a child?First off, baby would not be expected to be immune to chicken pox, particularly after 6-8 months when placental immunity has faded away. However, other immune factors in breastmilk will give baby some protection from chicken pox. Per Dr. Jack Newman (in How Breast Milk Protects Newborns), Free fatty acids present in milk can damage the membranes of enveloped viruses, such as the chicken pox virus, which are packets of genetic material encased in protein shells. The secretory IgA in breastmilk has also been shown to be active against the chicken pox virus in vitro. Case reports suggest thatas with other viral infectionsbreastfed babies who get chicken pox will often (but not always) get milder cases.Additional InformationBreastfeeding and Vaccines @ Immune factors in human milk @  The Immune System and Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases from The Immune Deficiency Foundation Patient and Family Handbook For The Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases, Fourth EditionUnderstanding The Immune System from the National Institute of HealthHahn-Zoric M, Fulconis F, Minoli I, et al.

My baby is sick – should I continue to breastfeed?,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/baby-illness/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCAbsolutely! Anytime a sick baby is able to take anything by mouth, it should be his mothers milk. Moms milk provides antibodies specifically tailored to fight babys illness, and is quickly and easily digested.Temporary weaning, besides depriving baby of antibodies to fight the illness and the most easily digestible food source available, can make life miserable for both mother and baby. Nursing is extremely comforting to an ill baby and a major part of the healing process. Mom would have to pump to maintain milk supply and then there would still be some risk that supply would drop somewhat. Not pumping would put mom at risk for breast infection and extreme discomfort.Colds and congestionBaby refuses to nurse when sickVomiting and DiarrheaBreastmilk vs. PedialyteAdditional Information and ReferencesColds and congestionIf baby has a cold and is congested, it can make breastfeeding difficult. However, it is almost always easier for a sick baby to nurse than to take a bottle. If your baby has a stuffy nose and is having a hard time breathing and nursing at the same time, try the following:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Keep baby as upright as possible while nursing. At night, try propping up on lots of pillows and nursing/sleeping semi-upright. Also try the Australian position (mom is down under)  in this position, mom is lying on her back and baby is on top (facing down), tummy to tummy with mom.The best thing you can do to help babys illness end quickly is to nurse often  that way she gets lots of the antibodies that your body is making to help her fight off the illness. Frequent nursing also helps to ensure that baby is getting plenty of milk (congested babies often nurse for shorter times since its hard to breathe and nurse at the same time).Use saline drops (or breastmilk) & a rubber suction bulb to clear babys nose before nursing (if baby wont tolerate the bulb syringe, then the saline drops/breastmilk alone should still help).Put baby on your knees, face up and tilt your knees a little downhill (so babys head is angled away from you, toward the floor).Put 2-3 drops of saline in each nostril and let it sit for a minute or so.To suction the mucus out, squeeze the bulb part of the syringe first, gently stick the rubber tip into one nostril, then slowly release the bulb.If baby is really congested, you may have to do this several times a day. Do it BEFORE baby nurses; if you do it afterwards your baby may spit up everything shes eaten because syringing can stimulate the gag reflex.To prepare saline drops at home, dissolve one teaspoon of salt in two cups of warm water.Run a vaporizer or humidifier, preferably in a small closed room.Boil a pot of water (some moms use small crock pots/potpourri pots), remove from the stove and add a few drops of essential oil (for example, eucalyptus, sage or balsam), and let the scent permeate the air. This may help relieve some head congestion.Do NOT apply products containing peppermint oil, camphor or menthol on the face (especially in the nose) or chest of a baby or young child. There have been cases where the direct application of menthol or camphor products (for example, Vicks VapoRub) to babys skin resulted in severe breathing difficulties or liver problems (see Camphor Hepatoxicity, Camphor Monograph and Menthol Toxicology).Nurse in a steamy bathroom. To pump up the steam, run a really hot shower and set a chair outside the shower for nursing.The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommend that children under the age of six not be given over-the-counter cough or cold medicines due to the risk of serious and life-threatening side effects. There is also no evidence that over-the-counter cold meds actually benefit children younger than six years old. There are several well controlled studies where there has been no difference shown between children given medication and those who have not.Sometimes moms are advised to limit or discontinue breastfeeding because milk increases mucus production. This is not good advice for two reasons:You are not a cow and your milk is not a dairy product. So even if dairy is a problem, your milk would not be.In addition, there is no scientific evidence that cows milk results in the production of more mucus unless you are allergic to dairy products.Baby refuses to nurse when sickSome babies may refuse to nurse when sick (particularly if something like a sore throat or pressure from an ear infection makes nursing painful for baby). If this happens, try different nursing positions  particularly those where baby is upright  and keep offering to nurse at least every hour or so. See also: What to do about a nursing strike. Rest assured that your baby will return to nursing when he feels better. Here are some things to try if baby is too uncomfortable to nurse:feed baby expressed milk from a cup, dropper, spoon or syringetry momsicles, or freeze your milk until its slushy and let baby eat it with a spoonfor older babies (over six months) who are eating solids: if baby will take solids but not nurse, add lots of breastmilk to the solids. You might also try making yogurt from breastmilk.Vomiting and DiarrheaAnother time when moms can be unsure about whether to continue nursing is when baby has diarrhea or is vomiting. Frequent and loose stools in a breastfed baby is not necessarily diarrhea. Here is more information on normal stooling patterns for breastfed babies: What Are Babys Stools Supposed to Look Like? Diarrhea in a breastfed baby is diagnosed when a baby has 12-16 stools per day (or more often than the babys regular stool frequency), watery stools, and an offensive odor to the stools. Just one of these symptoms does not in itself mean the baby has diarrhea.The current recommendations when vomiting or diarrhea is present in the breastfed child are as follows:Breastfeeding should be the FIRST choice if your child can take anything by mouth. Because of the ease and rapidity with which breastmilk is digested, even if your child vomits or stools shortly after nursing, he will still have retained some of the nutrients. Other foods that are often suggested (such as Pedialyte, sports drinks, gelatins and sodas) offer little nutritional value and none of the antibodies that human milk contains.When your breastfed child is ill youll want to offer more frequent feedings  this can limit the volume taken in at one time and helps to comfort and soothe a sick child. If your child is vomiting often and not keeping the milk down for long, it may be helpful to breastfeed frequently but limit the length of each nursing session (so your child takes in less milk at once). Another option is for Mom to express some milk before breastfeeding so that the milk flow is slower. RARELY does the baby who is allowed to breastfeed at will during a vomiting or diarrhea illness become dehydrated.The use of an oral rehydration therapy such as Pedialyte is a sound recommendation for a formula-fed infant who is vomiting or who has diarrhea, but using this in place of breastmilk offers no benefit to the breastfed baby. Human milk is a natural fluid, unlike formula and other milk products, that again is easily and rapidly digested.Forego the Pedialyte as long as baby continues to nurse well and as long as there are no signs of dehydration. If baby is showing signs of dehydration, talk to your doctor. Following are signs of dehydration:fewer than 2 wet diapers in a 24-hour periodbaby not behaving normally (more irritable, less active, sleeping more)lethargylistlessnessweak cryno tears (in an infant older than 3 months)dry mouthskin that stays wrinkly-looking when pinched (pull up the skin on the front of the hand; it should pop easily back into place  not stay pinched or wrinkly-looking)eyes that look sunkencool, clammy extremities, especially the fingers and toesfast breathing, or a heart that is beating faster than usualfeverBabies who are allowed to continue breastfeeding through an illness such as this are less likely to become dehydrated than those who are taken off the breast. Continued nursing also provides your child with precious antibodies that will prevent the illness from worsening and speed healing. Nursing is also very comforting to your child, which is healing in itself.Breastfed babies sometimes need oral rehydration therapy (Pedialyte, etc), though far less often than artificially fed infants. The World Health Organization recommends continuing to breastfeed during and after oral rehydration therapy. Research shows that babies lose more weight and actually have more stools during diarrhea when they are deprived of breastmilk.Sometimes moms are recommended to withhold breastmilk because it is a dairy product. Breastmilk is NOT considered a dairy or milk product (mom is not a cow!).Anytime there is diarrhea (in adults as well as babies) it can take a while for the bowel to heal and the stools to get back to normal. So even if you identify the problem and take corrective action, you may not see favorable results for a few weeks. This is because if the bowel gets irritated it is harder for the bowel to digest lactose  the undigested lactose then actually creates more irritation and runny stools it can be tough to turn around at times. There is usually an inflammatory response with diarrhea  that is the part that takes time to heal. When the cause of the problem is removed (when baby recovers from the illness), the gut will heal even if the baby is still fed breastmilk. More here on secondary lactose intolerance.Breastmilk vs. PedialyteWhen baby is sick, moms are sometimes told to discontinue or restrict breastfeeding and substitute an oral rehydration therapy such as Pedialyte. This outdated practice has been shown to offer no benefits to the breastfed baby, and can even delay healing.Your milk has four things that your baby needs even more than usual when hes sick:Antibodies to fight this illness  you want baby to get as much of these as possible. Encourage *more* nursing rather than less. Pedialyte has no antibodies.Liquids to keep baby hydrated. Your baby may not be eating as much because he doesnt feel well. Sick babies are more likely to nurse than to take anything else by mouth, so nursing is important to keep baby hydrated. Keeping baby well hydrated also helps keep the mucus secretions thinned out if baby has a cold or other congestion. So again, you want to nurse *more*. Pedialyte will keep baby hydrated, but so will breastmilk.Concentrated nutrients. Breastmilk is easily and quickly digested, so baby gets more nutrients and absorbs them faster. Pedialyte will keep baby hydrated but has little nutritional value. Again, its best to nurse *more* since baby may not be eating as much if he feels bad.Comfort. Sick babies need more comforting  what better way to do this than at the breast?See the section above for more information on the use of Pedialyte in breastfed babies  Breastfed babies sometimes do need oral rehydration therapy (Pedialyte, etc), though far less often than artificially fed infants. The World Health Organization recommends continuing to breastfeed during and after oral rehydration therapy.Additional Information and References@ Babys health issues: LinksSurgery  Mom or BabyShould breastfeeding continue when mom is sick?Will lying down to nurse cause ear infections?@ other websitesWithdrawal of Cold Medicines: Addressing Parent Concerns from the AAPThe AAP Practice Parameter on The Management of Acute Gastroenteritis in Young Children states that Infants fed human milk can be nursed safely during episodes of diarrhea.Runny Nose (with green or yellow mucus) parent info sheet from the US Centers for Disease ControlChildhood Illness Index from AskDrSears.comBaby Health: Colds from Babycenter.com (general health information)Working with Your Childs Doctor by Janice Berry, from New Beginnings, Vol. 16 No. 6, November-December 1999, pp. 196-199.ReferencesBhattacharya SK, et al.

The US Red Cross okays blood donation for nursing moms after 6 weeks postpartum. Donating blood causes a small loss of blood volume (and therefore a loss of fluid), so there is a theoretical possibility for a short-term temporary reduction in milk supply. Moms with vulnerable supplies may want to avoid donation. In general, women who are not pregnant, have good iron levels (that will be tested before donation), are not taking antibiotics, and are at least 100 pounds are good candidates for blood donation.Can a Lactating Woman Donate Blood?

Should breastfeeding continue when mom is sick?,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/mom-illness/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCIt is very, very rare for a mom to need to stop breastfeeding for any illness. There are only a few very serious illnesses that might require a mom stop breastfeeding for a period of time or permanently. Per Dr. Ruth Lawrence, HIV and HTLV-1 are the only infectious diseases that are considered absolute contraindications to breastfeeding in developed countries (Lawrence & Lawrence 2001).During any ordinary illness such as a cold, sore throat, flu, tummy bug, fever, mastitis, etc. you should continue to breastfeed. Just remind your doctor you are nursing so that if medications are needed he can prescribe something that is compatible with breastfeeding. Most medications are safe to take while breastfeeding, and for those that are not recommended there is almost always an alternative medication that is safe.If mom has food poisoning, breastfeeding should continue. As long as the symptoms are confined to the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps), breastfeeding should continue without interruption as there is no risk to the baby. This is the case with most occurences of food poisoning. If the food poisoning progresses to septicemia, meaning the bacteria has passed into moms bloodstream (mom would most likely be hospitalized), see this guidance from Dr. Ruth Lawrence:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Maternal infections of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract do not pose a risk to infants except in the rare circumstances when septicemia occurs and bacteria might reach the milk. Even in this event, continued breastfeeding while the mother receives appropriate antibiotic therapy that is compatible with breastfeeding is the safest course for the infant. If the infecting organism is especially virulent or contagious (e.g., an invasive group A streptococcal infection causing severe disease in the mother), breastfeeding should continue after a temporary suspension during the first 24 hours of maternal therapy. Prophylactic or empiric therapy for the infant, against the same organism, may be indicated. [source: Lawrence RM & Lawrence RA. Given the Benefits of Breastfeeding, what Contraindications Exist? Pediatric Clinics of North America 2001 (February);48(1): 235-51.]The best thing you can do for your baby when youre sick is to continue to breastfeed. When you have a contagious illness such as a cold, flu, or other mild virus, your baby was exposed to the illness before you even knew you were sick. Your milk will not transmit your illness to baby, but it does have antibodies in it that are specific to your illness (plus anything else you or baby have been exposed to)  theyll help prevent baby from getting sick, or if he does get sick, hell probably not be as sick as you.Withholding your breastmilk during an illness increasesthe possibility that baby will get sick, and deprives babyof the comfort and superior nutrition of nursing.You can also take measures to prevent baby from getting sick by doing the usual things to prevent the spread of illness: washing hands often, avoid sneezing/coughing on baby, limiting face-to-face contact, etc .When youre sick, it can help to just tuck baby into bed beside you and nurse lying down whenever baby gets hungry. If baby starts getting sick and not wanting to nurse, then see Baby refuses to nurse when sick.Many times moms dont nurse frequently enough and dont get enough fluids to keep the milk supply going. Sometimes medications can cause your milk supply to diminish, as well. To avoid a decreased milk supply, drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, continue to nurse often and avoid/limit any medications that tend to decrease milk supply.References and Additional Information@ Cold and Allergy Remedies Compatible with BreastfeedingNatural treatments for nursing momsIs This Safe When Breastfeeding?

We have found that if 500ml of water in a one litre aluminium cooking pot is boiled, and between 50ml and 150ml of breast milk is placed in a standard peanut butter jar in the water, the milk heats up to between 59C and 63C for approximately 15 minutes. This process is called Pretoria Pasteurisation and is very inexpensive, requiring almost no technological support. Thus, almost any mother can pasteurise her own milk.The next step was to check if this process destroys HIV. This study has been successfully completed and no living virus could be demonstrated in breast milk from either HIV-infected mothers who expressed their breast milk, or in HIV naive breast milk spiked with HIV.Over and above killing the virus, a significant advantage of this inexpensive method is that about 80% of the essential ingredients (antibodies, vitamins, etc.) of breast milk are unaffected.Jeffrey BS, Mercer KG.

Keep in mind that your breast size will more than likely increase during pregnancy and breastfeeding, so the vest you wear pre-pregnancy may be too tight when you are breastfeeding  if the vest is too tight, it could cause problems with plugged ducts. If you are exceptionally prone to plugged ducts, the additional pressure from the weight of the vest might be a problem, but not under most circumstances. There are a number of case reports of nursing moms who have worn a bulletproof vest with no problem.[Contents]Chlorinated swimming poolsNot a problem. If baby is in the water, too, he will get more chlorine from the water around him than the tiny residual on moms breast.

LLL FAQ[contents]Hair RemovalIn general, topical products (including hair removal products like Nair, etc.) that are applied to the skin do not end up in breastmilk, due to poor absorption into moms bloodstream. The only caution I can find (and this was actually talking about using Nair to remove hair in the areola area) was to do a spot test first to make sure youre not allergic (and this applies to anyone using this type of product).There is no evidence that electrolysis or laser hair removal would affect breastfeeding or your breastfed baby.[contents]Hot tubsNursing moms should simply observe the usual precautions when using a hot tub.

Per Thomas Hale, PhD (author of Medications and Mothers Milk), most topicals are so poorly absorbed through the skin that they never really attain significant plasma levels in mom, and so they never end up in milk. This ought to be the case with hydroquinone, as it is know that skin absorption is minimal.[contents]Skin creamsSkin creams and lotions in general, including those containing alpha hydroxy acids, are not a problem for breastfeeding moms. Most are best kept away from the nipple area (so that baby does not swallow it). When it comes to topical medicines, virtually nothing passes through the skin to the bloodstream unless it is specifically formulated to do so (such as the nicotine patches).[contents]Sunscreen, Self-tanning productsBecause these are topically applied, very little would absorb through the skin into the bloodstream and therefore into your milk. They should not be a problem for the breastfeeding mom and baby. Do be careful about applying it on the breast  make sure baby doesnt get any in his mouth.The spray tanning booths (also called UV-free tanning, airbrush tanning, spray on tanning, etc.) come under the category of self-tanning products. To prevent baby ingesting the self-tanning lotion, wash the self-tanning product from your breasts before nursing.[contents]TanningTanning is completely compatible with breastfeeding and will not alter the milk whatsoever. There is no record of any dangers to the breastfed baby in relation to tanning. Sometimes clients are given Carotene to enhance the tanning  that should be avoided while breastfeeding.

Exercise and Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/mom-exercise/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCModerate exercise improves a mothers health and has a positive effect on her emotional well-being. Some of the benefits include:Higher level of cardiovascular fitnessImproved blood lipid profiles and insulin responseA feeling of well-being from improved energy and reduced stress levelsEnhanced maternal-infant relationshipAlleviation of depression symptoms in those with major depressive disordersResearch has shown that moderate exercise does not affect milk supply, milk composition, or babys growth. Exercising to exhaustion may have a short-term effect on lactic acid and IgA content of a mothers milk (more details below).Does exercise affect milk supply or nutrient content?No. Studies have shown no difference in milk production or nutrient composition or babies weight gain. One study showed a slight increase in milk supply for the women who exercised regularly, but because of the small size of the study this increase may not be significant.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Does exercise affect immunologic factors in milk?A couple of small studies have shown that there is no difference in immunologic factors after moderate exercise, but that IgA levels are decreased short-term after exhaustive exercise. Most breastfeeding mothers do not exercise to exhaustion, but for those that do so and breastfeed soon after, a decrease in IgA levels in one feeding per day is unlikely to be significant.More details: In 1997, a study by Gregory et al found that IgA levels in breastmilk were decreased for a short time (10-30 minutes) after mom had exercised strenuously (exhaustive exercise), but that levels had returned to normal within an hour. They also observed that IgA levels increased after the breast had been emptied, whether or not mom had been exercising strenuously. In 2003, Lovelady et al looked at immunologic factors (IgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme) in breastmilk after moderate exercise, and found no difference in the milk of exercising and non-exercising mothers.Does lactic acid increase in breastmilk after exercise?Research has not shown a noticeable increase in lactic acid buildup after moderate exercise (50% & 75% intensity). The lactic acid in breastmilk does increase somewhat if mom exercises to maximum (100%) intensity, also described as exhaustive exercise. This increase may be present up to 90 minutes post-exercise. There are no known harmful effects for the baby.Will baby refuse the breast after mom exercises?Most studies have found no difference in acceptance of the breast, even after maximum intensity exercise.Although a highly publicized 1992 study indicated that baby might fuss or refuse expressed milk from a mom who had been exercising at 100% intensity, the results were questionable because the babies were fed the milk by dropper (unfamiliar to these babies), and the mothers reported that the babies had not had problems with nursing after exercise in the past. A more recent study showed no change in infants acceptable of moms milk an hour after exercise, even for the moms who exercised at maximum intensity (and thus did have a slight increase in lactic acid in their milk).If baby seems to object to the taste of moms milk after strenuous exercise, keep in mind that it might have nothing to do with the exercise  baby might be distracted or objecting to the salty taste of sweat on your breast, etc. If this happens consistently, mom might try expressing a little milk (3-5 mL from each breast) before nursing baby, postponing feeding for a half hour to let the lactic acid levels subside, and/or decreasing workout intensity a bit in the future.Exercise guidelines for breastfeeding mothersFor your own comfort, you may wish to nurse before exercising and wear a good, supportive bra (especially during strenuous exercises such as running, jumping, etc).Some babies dont like nursing when mom has been sweating (due to the salt on moms skin) so you may wish to rinse your breasts or take a shower before nursing.If you regularly lift weights or do other exercises involving repetitive arm movement and you develop plugged ducts, cut back and start again more slowly.Keep yourself hydrated.Additional informationMore exercise-related FAQsCan I lose weight while breastfeeding?Swimming & chlorinated swimming poolsHot tubsInsect repellentScuba divingSunscreen & self-tanning productsTanningThe Active Mommy Conundrum: Can Exercise Harm Breastfeeding?

Breast-feeding mothers can exercise: results of a cohort study. Public Health Nutr. 2007 Oct;10(10):1089-93. Epub 2007 May 22.Exercise does not affect breast-feeding outcomes at the usual levels of activity undertaken by mothers. Breast-feeding and exercise are important for maintaining and promoting health, and this study provides reassurance to health professionals wishing to encourage mothers to continue both behaviours.Bopp M, Lovelady C, Hunter C, Kinsella T. Maternal diet and exercise: effects on long-chain polyunsaturated Fatty Acid concentrations in breast milk. J Am Diet Assoc. 2005 Jul;105(7):1098-103.These results suggest that women consuming adequate amounts of LC-PUFA can exercise moderately without decreasing the LC-PUFA in their breast milk.Lovelady CA. The impact of energy restriction and exercise in lactating women (Review). Adv Exp Med Biol. 2004;554:115-20.Exercise improves cardiovascular fitness, plasma lipids, and insulin response in lactating women. However, exercise alone, without caloric restriction, does not promote weight loss. Once lactation is established, over-weight women may restrict their energy intake by 500 kcal/day to promote a weight loss of 0.5 kg/week without affecting the growth of their infants. Moderate exercise does not affect maternal immune status or levels of sIgA, lactoferrin, and lysozyme in human milk. Further research is needed to determine the effect of exercise and energy restriction on maternal bone health and immune status and composition of human milk.Lovelady CA, Fuller CJ, Geigerman CM, Hunter CP, Kinsella TC. Immune status of physically active women during lactation. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2004 Jun;36(6):1001-7.The results of this study suggest that women may exercise moderately during lactation and increase their fitness level without impairing their immune function.Rich M, Currie J, McMahon C. Physical exercise and the lactating woman: a qualitative pilot study of mothers perceptions and experiences. Breastfeed Rev. 2004 Jul;12(2):11-7.The main themes to emerge from the content analysis of the qualitative data included perceived well-being from improved energy and stress levels, and weight control.Lovelady CA, Hunter CP, Geigerman C. Effect of Exercise on Immunologic Factors in Breast Milk. Pediatrics 2003 February;111(2):e148-e152.This study found that nursing mothers who exercis[ed] aerobically at least 30 minutes/day for 3 days/wk had a higher level of cardiovascular fitness. In addition, there were no significant differences in the concentrations of IgA, lactoferrin, or lysozyme after moderate exercise compared with sitting rest.Larson-Meyer DE. Effect of Postpartum Exercise on Mothers and their Offspring: A Review of the Literature. Obes Res. 2002 Aug;10(8):841-53.In lactating women, several studies have collectively determined that neither acute nor regular exercise has adverse effects on a mothers ability to successfully breast-feed.Wright KS, Quinn TJ, Carey GB. Infant acceptance of breast milk after maternal exercise. Pediatrics. 2002 Apr;109(4):585-9.These data support the hypothesis that moderate or even high-intensity exercise during lactation does not impede infant acceptance of breast milk consumed 1 hour postexercise.Cary GB, Quinn TJ. Exercise and lactation: are they compatible? (Review) Can J Appl Physiol. 2001 Feb;26(1):55-75.Human studies suggest no detrimental effect of exercise during lactation on milk composition and volume, infant growth and development, or maternal health. Studies also demonstrate improved cardiovascular fitness in lactating, exercising women and suggest a quicker return to pre-pregnancy body weight and a more positive sense of well-being, compared to sedentary controls.Lovelady CA, Williams JP, Garner KE, Moreno KL, Taylor ML, Leklem JE. Effect of energy restriction and exercise on vitamin B-6 status of women during lactation. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2001 Apr;33(4):512-8.Energy restriction and exercise from 4 to 14 wk postpartum in overweight, breastfeeding women consuming adequate dietary intakes and 2.0 mg of supplemental vitamin B-6 does not adversely affect vitamin B-6 status or infant growth.Babyak M, et al. Exercise treatment for major depression: maintenance of therapeutic benefit at 10 months. Psychosom Med. 2000 Sep-Oct;62(5):633-8.Among individuals with MDD, exercise therapy is feasible and is associated with significant therapeutic benefit, especially if exercise is continued over time.McCrory MA, et al. Randomized trial of the short-term effects of dieting compared with dieting plus aerobic exercise on lactation performance. Am J Clin Nutr 1999 May;69(5):959-67.Short-term weight loss (1 kg/wk) through a combination of dieting and aerobic exercise appears safe for breast-feeding mothers and is preferable to weight loss achieved primarily by dieting because the latter reduces maternal lean body mass. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.Quinn TJ, Carey GB. Does exercise intensity or diet influence lactic acid accumulation in breast milk? Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1999 Jan;31(1):105-10.In lactating women whose caloric needs are being met: 1) dietary carbohydrate intake, within a practical range, does not influence lactic acid levels in breast milk at rest or after exercise; 2) lactic acid appearance in the milk is a function of exercise intensity; and 3) moderate intensity exercise will not increase breast milk lactic acid levels.Fly AD, Uhlin KL, Wallace JP. Major mineral concentrations in human milk do not change after maximal exercise testing. Am J Clin Nutr. 1998 Aug;68(2):345-9.In conclusion, maximal exercise did not alter concentrations of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium in milk. Thus, with respect to mineral concentrations in milk, there is no contraindication for exercise during lactation.Dewey KG. Effects of maternal caloric restriction and exercise during lactation (Review). J Nutr 1998 Feb;128(2 Suppl):386S-389S.Gradual weight loss (2 kg/mo) [4.4 lbs/mo] seems to have no adverse effect on milk volume or composition, provided that the mother is not undernourished and is breast-feeding her infant on demand. Aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular fitness and does not affect milk energy transfer to the infant, but exercise alone is not likely to increase the rate of weight loss unless dietary intake is controlled. Less information is available on the effect of rapid weight loss. Data from a recent randomized intervention trial indicate that a short-term (11 day) energy deficit of 35%, achieved by dieting or a combination of dieting and increased exercise, results in weight loss >1 kg/wk and does not adversely affect lactation. Exercise enhances maintenance of lean body mass and is therefore a recommended component of any weight loss program. Maternal plasma prolactin concentration generally increases under conditions of negative energy balance, which may serve to protect lactation. Further research is required on the longer-term effect of energy restriction and on the effects of energy balance in lactating women with low fat reserves.Carey GB, Quinn TJ, Goodwin SE. Breast milk composition after exercise of different intensities. J Hum Lact. 1997 Jun;13(2):115-20.Milk LA [lactic acid] after the 100% intensity session was significantly elevated through 90 minutes postexercise, while there was no significant increase in milk LA at any collection time after the 50% or 75% intensity sessions. There were no significant differences in milk pH, lipid, ammonium, or urea measurements after any of the exercise sessions. These data show that unlike maximum intensity exercise, moderate intensity exercise does not increase breast milk LA content.Gregory RL, Wallace JP, Gfell LE, Marks J, King BA. Effect of exercise on milk immunoglobulin A. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997 Dec;29(12):1596-601. This study observed short-term decreased IgA levels in breastmilk after exhaustive exercise. Milk IgA concentrations increased significantly in both exercise and resting control groups after the breasts were emptied, suggesting that breast emptying stimulated milk IgA synthesis. The results provide evidence that exercise alters milk IgA and IgA1 concentrations for 10-30 min after exhaustive exercise, but recovers by 1 h, and provide additional support for exercise effects on the mucosal immune system.Lovelady CA, Nommsen-Rivers LA, McCrory MA, Dewey KG. Effects of exercise on plasma lipids and metabolism of lactating women. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1995 Jan;27(1):22-8.Dewey KG, et al. A randomized study of the effects of aerobic exercise by lactating women on breast-milk volume and composition. N Engl J Med 1994 Feb 17;330(7):449-53.In this study, aerobic exercise performed four or five times per week beginning six to eight weeks post partum had no adverse effect on lactation and significantly improved the cardiovascular fitness of the mothers.Prentice A. Should lactating women exercise? Nutr Rev. 1994 Oct;52(10):358-60.After 12 weeks, aerobic capacity was significantly higher in the women who had exercised than in the controls, but no differences in body weight, body fatness, energy expenditure, or resting metabolic rate (RMR) were noted. The exercise program had no effect on breast milk output or composition or infant weight gain. This demonstrates that recreational exercise sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness without substantially altering energy balance does not adversely affect lactation performance.Wallace JP, Inbar G, Ernsthausen K. Infant acceptance of postexercise breast milk. Pediatrics. 1992 Jun;89(6 Pt 2):1245-7.Maximal exercise resulted in a significant increase in lactic acid concentration in breast milk that may be high enough to affect the taste of the milk. The decreased acceptance of postexercise milk was associated with increased lactic acid concentration.Wallace JP, Rabin J. The concentration of lactic acid in breast milk following maximal exercise. Int J Sports Med. 1991 Jun;12(3):328-31.Following maximal exercise, a significant increase in the concentration of lactic acid was found in the blood at 5 minutes postexercise and breast milk at 10 minutes postexercise. Although elevated, the lactic acid concentration of the 30-minute sample of breast milk was not significantly different from the resting sample. Maximal exercise can result in significant increase in lactic acid concentration in breast milk. Further research is needed to demonstrate whether the taste of the milk is affected.Lovelady CA, Lonnerdal B, Dewey KG. Lactation performance of exercising women. Am J Clin Nutr. 1990 Jul;52(1):103-9.Exercising women differed significantly from control subjects in maximum oxygen consumption, percent body fat, total energy expenditure, and energy intake. There was no difference between the groups in plasma hormones or milk energy, lipid, protein, or lactose content. Exercising subjects tended to have higher milk volume (839 vs 776 g/d) and energy output in milk (538 vs 494 kcal/d). Thus, there was no apparent adverse effect of vigorous exercise on lactation performance.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding and Cigarette Smoking,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/smoking/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCShould a mother who smokes cigarettes breastfeed?What happens to babies when they are exposed to cigarette smoke?How does does smoking affect breastfeeding?How to minimize the risk to your baby if you smokeReferences and More InformationShould a mother who smokes cigarettes breastfeed?First of all, a mom who cant stop smoking should breastfeed. Breastfeeding provides many immunities that help your baby fight illness and can even help counteract some of the effects of cigarette smoke on your baby: for example, breastfeeding has been shown to decrease the negative effects of cigarette smoke on a babys lungs. Its definitely better if breastfeeding moms not smoke, but if you cant stop or cut down, then it is better to smoke and breastfeed than to smoke and formula feed.The more cigarettes that you smoke, the greater the health risks for you and your baby. If you cant stop smoking, or dont want to stop smoking, its safer for your baby if you cut down on the number of cigarettes that you smoke.What happens to babies when they are exposed to cigarette smoke?Babies and children who are exposed to cigarette smoke have a much higher incidence of pneumonia, asthma, ear infections, bronchitis, sinus infections, eye irritation, and croup.Colic occurs more often in babies whose mothers or fathers smoke or if a breastfeeding mother smokes. Researchers believe that not only does the nicotine transferred into mothers milk upset baby but the passive smoke in the home acts as an irritant. Babies of smoking parents fuss more, and mothers who smoke may be less able to cope with a colicky baby (due to lower levels of prolactin).Heavy smoking by breastfeeding moms occasionally causes symptoms in the breastfeeding baby such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea.Babies of smoking mothers and fathers have a seven times greater chance of dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Children of smoking parents have two to three times more visits to the doctor, usually from respiratory infections or allergy-related illnesses.Children who are exposed to passive smoke in the home have lower blood levels of HDL, the good cholesterol that helps protect against coronary artery disease.Children of smoking parents are more likely to become smokers themselves.A recent study found that growing up in a home in which two parents smoked could double the childs risk of lung cancer later in life.How does does smoking affect breastfeeding?Smoking has been linked to:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Earlier weaning. One study showed that the heaviest smokers tend to wean the earliest.Lower milk productionInterference with milk let-downLower levels of prolactin. The hormone prolactin must be present for milk synthesis to occur.One study (Laurberg 2004) indicated that smoking mothers who live in areas of mild to moderate iodine deficiency have less iodine in their breastmilk (needed for babys thyroid function) compared to nonsmoking mothers. The study authors suggested that breastfeeding mothers who smoke consider taking an iodine supplement.Although smoking has been linked to milk production and let-down problems, this may be related to poor lactation management rather than physiological causes. Dr. Lisa Amir, in a review published in 2001, concluded that Although there is consistent evidence that women who smoke breastfeed their infants for a shorter duration than non-smokers, the evidence for a physiological mechanism is not strong.How to minimize the risk to your baby if you smokeThe ideal: Stop smoking altogether.Cut down. The less you smoke, the smaller the chance that difficulties will arise. The risks increase if you smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day.Dont smoke immediately before or during breastfeeding. It will inhibit let-down and is dangerous to your baby.Smoke immediately after breastfeeding to cut down on the amount of nicotine in your milk during nursing. Wait as long as possible between smoking and nursing. It takes 95 minutes for half of the nicotine to be eliminated from your body.Avoid smoking in the same room with your baby. Even better, smoke outside, away from your baby and other children. Dont allow anyone else to smoke near your baby.This article is dedicated to the memory of my mother-in-law, a long-time smoker who died of lung cancer in January 1999.

Cold and Allergy Remedies Compatible with Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/meds/cold-remedy/,"The common cold will usually run its course within 7 to 14 days. There are many natural remedies and over the counter products that are compatible with breastfeeding. Image credit: Jerry Bunker on flickrNatural RemediesGeneralRest. Drink lots of water and take hot baths. Run a humidifier.Take in extra vitamin C from foods, juices or in supplement form.Echinacea is generally recognized to be safe for nursing moms.Garlic eaten raw, cooked, or taken as a supplement can help. Raw is always best, though its hardest to get down.Homeopathic remedies, are considered safe for nursing moms.OMT is a very gentle form of osteopathic manipulation, which can enhance the immune system, and help keep the fluids draining from the head and neck so bacteria and viruses are less likely to be able to grow. This can help to reduce or even prevent chronic ear and respiratory infections. OMT has been shown to have a dramatic effect on fluid in the ears, and works well on any type of upper respiratory infection.Head congestionUse a saline nasal spraySteam treatments:Boil a pot of water, remove from the stove and (optional) add a few drops of essential oils (for example: eucalyptus, sage and balsam). Drape a bath towel over your head and breathe deeply for 5 minutes. Do this 2 or 3x a day until symptoms subside.Put two inches of apple cider vinegar in a pan and heat until it begins to steam. Inhale the vapor. If the vapor is too strong, add a little water. Repeat as needed.Essential Oils: Place a drop or two of either eucalyptus or peppermint essential oil on a cotton ball or handkerchief and hold near the nose while breathing deeply.A couple of cautions: Do not use the oil in the nose  it can cause swelling. Do not use peppermint oil or menthol (one of the main components in peppermint oil) or camphor on or near the breast where baby might ingest it, and do not apply directly on the skin of a baby or young child. There have been cases where the direct application of menthol or camphor products (for example, Vicks VapoRub) to babys skin resulted in severe breathing difficulties or liver problems (see info on colds and congestion in baby).Cayenne pepper: Sprinkle it on your food, or put a quarter teaspoon in a glass of water and drink.Drink fenugreek tea to relieve head and chest congestion and cough.What To Do When You Have Sinus Pain by Allison IshmanChest congestionAnise steam treatment: Boil a pot of water, remove from the stove and add about 3 teaspoons of dried anise. Drape a bath towel over your head and breathe deeply for 5 minutes. Do this 3x a day to help keep the chest clear.Drink fenugreek tea to relieve head and chest congestion and cough.Sore, itchy throat and/or coughDrink strong black tea (use 2 tea bags per cup).Drink hot lemonade with honey. Or make a mixture of one part lemon juice and two parts honey. Sip throughout the day.Drink fenugreek tea to relieve head and chest congestion and cough.Use Zinc gluconate lozenges, but avoid taking large amounts of zinc for more than seven days, because it can interfere with other minerals in the body.Salt water gargle:Mix a 1 tablespoon of salt in eight ounces of warm water. Gargle the whole mixture (dont swallow) several times a day.Apple-cider vinegar and water gargle.Mix 1-6 teaspoons (1/3  2 tablespoons) vinegar in a glass of water; you can mix it as strong as you can stand it. Gargle one mouthful (swallow afterward or spit it out). Repeat twice. Do this every hour, or as needed.Slippery elm bark can help with sore throat and cough. It comes in herbal cough drops and throat lozenges (check the other ingredients!), or you can make a tea. For tea, use 1 to 3 teaspoons of powdered bark per cup, boil and simmer 15 minutes. Up to 3 cups per day.Chamomile tea gargle (you can also drink the tea)Medications generally regarded as safeGeneral guidelinesTreat only the symptoms you have: avoid a combination medicine when a single one will do the job.Short-acting forms of drugs (6 hours or less) are generally better than the long-acting varieties (but see the info below on the nonsedating antihistamines).Use nasal spray instead of oral medications when possible (see below).Take any medication right AFTER you nurse and only as needed.The current edition of Medications and Mothers Milk by Thomas Hale, PhD has information on many cold medications (including specific guidance on combination products) in the Appendix. Many of the active ingredients in cold and allergy medications are listed below.Cough & sore throat medsSore throat sprays or lozenges are generally considered safe, as are cough drops. Avoid eating excessive amounts of cough drops containing menthol. Large amounts of menthol can reduce milk supply.Many forms of Robitussin, Delsym and Benylin are considered compatible with breastfeeding. Always check the active ingredients, as there are many versions.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Pain medsBoth Advil/Motrin (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (Acetaminophen) are considered compatible with breastfeeding.Aleve (Naproxen) is also AAP-approved for nursing mothers, but (per Hale) should be used with caution due to its long half-life and its effect on babys cardiovascular system, kidneys and GI tract; short-term, infrequent or occasional use is not necessarily incompatible with breastfeeding.Aspirin use is discouraged in children due to the risk of Reyes syndrome. Although the risk is probably low, it is also discouraged in nursing mothers because of the potential risk of Reyes syndrome and bleeding.Eye dropsEye drops designed for cold/allergy symptom relief are considered compatible with breastfeeding.Nasal sprays or gelsNasal sprays are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding.Decongestant nasal sprays are generally for short-term use (3-7 days) only; consult your health care provider and the package instructions for specific information.Of the preparations available for treatment of allergic symptoms, corticosteroid nasal sprays (e.g., Flonase, Nasacort, etc.) and cromolyn sodium nasal spray (a mast cell stabilizer, e.g., Nasalcrom) are considered to be, by far, some of the most effective and safest to use in breastfeeding moms. The plasma levels of these drugs are extremely low, and thus milk levels would be even lower.A homeopathic nasal gel, made by Zicam and containing ionic zinc gluconate, was recalled by the US FDA in 2009 because it has been associated with long lasting or permanent loss of smell (anosmia) [this is not related to lactation  see the FDA information page and Jafek BW, Linschoten MR, Murrow BW. Anosmia after intranasal zinc gluconate use. Am J Rhinol. 2004 May-Jun;18(3):137-41]. Zicam contains small amounts of zinc (Zincum Gluconicum)  266 micrograms per squirt; in one study (Mossad 2003) the daily dosage used was 2.1 mg per day. Zinc is considered compatible with breastfeeding, particularly in small amounts (excessive amounts are not a good idea, for moms sake rather than babys). The amount of systemic absorption of nasal sprays/gels is minimal compared to oral ingestion.DecongestantsBoth pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are generally considered to be safe for the breastfed baby, but pseudoephedrine may reduce milk supply.Pseudoephedrine & milk supply: Thomas Hale Ph. D., a renowned breastfeeding pharmacologist (Breastfeeding Pharmacology), notes that breastfeeding mothers with poor or marginal milk production should be exceedingly cautious in using pseudoephedrine and that it is apparent that mothers in late-stage lactation may be more sensitive to pseudoephedrine and have greater loss in milk production (Medications and Mothers Milk, 2012 edition).Dr. Hale is referring to this study: Aljazaf K, et. al. Pseudoephedrine: effects on milk production in women and estimation of infant exposure via breastmilk. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Jul;56(1):18-24.If you do take pseudoephedrine and notice a drop in milk supply (many moms do not, but research shows that it can decrease milk supply by as much as 24%), simply stop the medication and take measures to increase milk supply  the problem should resolve fairly quickly.Be very cautious about taking pseudoephedrine on a regular basis, as it has the potential to permanently decrease your milk supply. Regular use of pseudoephedrine (120 mg/day) has occasionally been used to decrease milk production in moms with overproduction, where the usual methods to regulate milk production were not working.AntihistaminesMoms use of sedating antihistamines (including Benadryl and Chlor-Trimeton products) are generally regarded to be compatible with breastfeeding, but always double-check the active ingredients as they can vary greatly. Monitor your infant for possible drowsiness if you use this type of antihistamine. The non-sedating antihistamines (below) are generally preferred and are less likely to sedate baby.The ingredients of Claritin, Claritin-D, Clarinex, Allegra, Allegra-D, and Zyrtec are generally regarded to be compatible with breastfeeding (again  always double-check the active ingredients). Loratadine (Claritin) has been studied and the amount of loratadine that passes into breastmilk is extremely low. Claritin-D and Allegra-D have the decongestant pseudoephedrine added (see above about possible effect on milk supply). Dr. Hale has said that he prefers the non-sedating antihistamines (even though they are long-acting) over the sedating allergy medications.Milk supply: A common concern is that the sedating antihistamines might lower milk supply but, per Dr. Thomas Hale, there is no current research supporting this belief  only some anecdotal reports. If you feel that your supply has decreased, it could simply be a byproduct of decreased nursing frequency or dehydration due to your illness.If you feel that a medication is the cause of a sudden drop in milk supply, then stop taking (or decrease your use of) the medication  if the med is indeed the cause, then supply should increase again soon after you stop taking it.

Breastfeeding and Mercury Exposure,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/chemicals/mercury/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCSince mercury is all around us in the environment, we all have                 small amounts of mercury in our bodies. There are different forms                 of mercury, and each form is absorbed into the body differently: Elemental/metallic mercury (like you find in old thermometers) is very poorly absorbed orally (0.01%) but well absorbed via inhalation (>80%). Inorganic mercury compounds are poorly absorbed orally (7-15%). Inorganic mercury compounds are found in mercury disk batteries and are used as antibacterials (Silvadene cream, for example). Organic mercury (methylmercury fungicides, phenyl mercury, ethylmercury) is well absorbed orally (90%). One of the organic mercury compounds, methylmercury, is the type we worry about when it comes to eating mercury contaminated fish and seafood. Thimerosal (a preservative) contains approximately 49% ethylmercury, which is an organic mercury. Organic mercury compounds tend to bioaccumulate  build up in the body over time  in humans and animals.As with other environmental contaminants, our exposure to mercury                 begins before birth. Most of a babys mercury exposure                 from the mother occurs during pregnancy, via the placenta. Mercury in human milkAlthough mercury does pass into breastmilk, the amount of mercury                 in breastmilk is not expected to be a problem under normal circumstances.                 Per Lawrence & Lawrence, in Breastfeeding: A Guide for the                 Medical Profession (2005, p. 417), Acute exposures to                 methylmercury from industrial or environmental sources should be                 evaluated on a case-by-case basis, although it appears breastfeeding                 is safe. A 2004 review on mercury and lead during breastfeeding                 (Dorea 2004) noted that cows milk-based formulas pose a greater                 risk of infant exposure to neurotoxic substances. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The mothers diet appears to be, by far, the primary source of                 mercury in breastmilk  studies have shown higher levels of mercury                 in the breastmilk of mothers who eat large amounts of fish. Mercury                 levels in breastmilk are about one-third the level of mercury in                 the mothers blood. The amount of mercury that reaches the milk                 depends upon the form of the mercury: inorganic mercury compounds                 enter the milk easily but are poorly absorbed by baby; organic mercury                 compounds do not enter the milk easily but the small amounts that                 do get through are easily absorbed by baby. Studies have shown that                 mercury levels in breastfed babies are highest right after birth                 and decline significantly by 2-3 months of age (Sakamoto 2002, Sandborgh-Englund                 2001, Drexler 1998). Amalgam dental fillingsA German study (Drexler 1998) found that during the first week                 after birth, the amount of mercury in the study mothers milk was                 associated with the number of amalgam (silver) dental                 fillings; at two months, the amount of mercury in breastmilk was                 much lower and associated with the mothers fish consumption (rather                 than the number of amalgam fillings). These authors concluded that                 the additional exposure to mercury of breast-fed babies from                 maternal amalgam fillings is of minor importance compared to maternal                 fish consumption. Some studies have found similar correlations                 between amalgam fillings and mercury levels (Drasch 1998, Oskarsson                 1996), but another German study (Klemann 1990) found no correlation                 between the total surface area of the mothers amalgam dental fillings                 and mercury in amniotic fluid, maternal blood, newborn blood or                 breastmilk, and concluded that maternal amalgam fillings are                 of no importance for the mercury load of the fetus and the neonate. Hale (Medications and Mothers Milk, 2004, p. 528) recommends                 that the replacement of amalgam fillings should if possible                 be postponed until after pregnancy and breastfeeding as the removal                 of amalgam fillings while breastfeeding could potentially increase                 the transfer of mercury to the breastfed infant. If replacement                 of an amalgam filling is necessary, Hale recommends that the dentist                 take routine precautions when removing the old amalgam: use                 copious amounts of cold water irrigation to minimize heat, use a                 rubber dam to isolate her mouth from the particles, and use an alternate                 source of air (oxygen) to minimize mercury vapor inhalation. Development of children exposed to mercury via breastmilkIn the two long-term studies of children exposed to methylmercury                 via breastmilk, no adverse effects were documented;                 in fact, the breastfed children scored better on developmental tests.                 A study in the Seychelles islands (Grandjean 1995) found that babies                 who were exposed to methylmercury via their mothers milk had higher developmental scores than formula fed babies, suggesting that if                 methylmercury exposure from human milk had any adverse effect on                 milestone development in these infants, the effect was compensated                 for or overruled by advantages associated with nursing. Another                 study in the Faroe Islands (Jensen 2005) found marginally                 better neuropsychological performance in 7 year olds who had                 been exposed to methylmercury via breastmilk.How do I minimize my childs exposure to mercury?Since mercury levels in babies begin to accumulate before birth,                 the US Food & Drug Administration advises pregnant women to                 avoid eating several types of fish that tend to have higher levels                 of mercury. Per the FDA, While it is true that the primary                 danger from methylmercury in fish is to the developing nervous system                 of the unborn child, it is prudent for nursing mothers and young                 children not to eat these fish as well. See Should                 I be avoiding certain kinds of fish? for more information.Additional Information Chemical                 Pollution and Mothers Milk: Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, and Other Metals from the Natural Resources Defence CouncilReferences (most recent listed first)Lawrence R, Lawrence R.

Perchlorate in Breastmilk: Responses to Concerns,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/chemicals/dasgupta-response/,"by Purnendu K Dasgupta. Reprinted with permission from the author.March 3, 2005Dear Kellymom:I am the senior author of the Texas Tech Breast Milk Study that has been much publicized and much misinterpreted. Since many women who breast feed visit your site, I would appreciate it if you could bring my viewpoint to your readers:As you obviously know, the topic in general and the paper in particular have received wide press coverage. Some of them report what I said accurately, others wrote what was in their mind. I cannot be responsible for them even when sometimes they put things in quote marks.First, I would like to assure you that even in my wildest imagination it did not cross my mind to advise someone to stop breast feeding just because perchlorate is detectable in breast milk. There are so many physiologic and psychological benefits of breast feeding, I truly regret if our paper has caused any one to stop breast feeding even for a day. Also, one needs to recognize that with improved detection technologies, we can detect almost anything at some level in almost anything.Our study was funded out of our pockets and internal funds  it is too small  it is preliminary  and it is far from perfect. No sweeping generalizations are in order and were not intended. We are hoping that a grant we have applied for will be funded and allow us to conduct a broader study.Aside from any issues on perchlorate, some of the women (even some with low perchlorate) we studied had very low levels of iodide. In a study on 100 pregnant women published in 2004 in Thyroid, scientists from the Boston Medical Center found 49 to be taking iodine below the recommended daily allowance (RDA, and Boston is not exactly seafood-deprived: after iodized salt, seafood is the second most important source of iodine). The median urinary iodine (UI) concentration in this study was 149 ug/L, just below the 150 ug/L UI value that is considered to correspond to adequate iodine intake (220 ug/day for a pregnant woman).Completely independent of our study, several experts have been saying for some time that this country is becoming iodine deficient. The effect of perchlorate (as far as presently known, the only effect) is to further aggravate iodine deficiency by inhibiting iodide transport. I am not expert on what levels of perchlorate will present a real problem; the venerable panel appointed by the National Academy of Sciences have already done that. However, one needs to be aware that any effect of perchlorate will depend on the iodine nutrition level; if the iodine nutrition level is poor, any effect of perchlorate will be magnified.Be concerned about your iodine nutrition. Contrary to what many believe, the majority of salted processed food does not contain iodized salt. It is the increased consumption of prepackaged and preprocessed food that is at least in part responsible for the reduced iodine intake.Unless you are into eating Sushi (specifically the seaweed wrappers), make sure that your vitamin contains the level of iodine recommended for a lactating mother (290 ug/day). At least up to 1100 ug/day is believed to safe but one should not attempt to overdose on iodine, either.What I have stated, not in the paper, but in a few interviews, is that health food stores sell dried Kelp capsules (that typically contain 300-400 ug organic iodine, which is only partly absorbed, and which is equivalent to 2-3 wrappers of typical Sushi offerings). One a day and not more than one a day should be fine. Although many real doctors have taken real issue with my suggestion about iodine supplements, one is not talking about radiation sickness pills here containing many milligrams of iodide. Japanese women on the average take twice our RDA and the average pediatric and maternal health in Japan are both much better (although admittedly there are far too many confounding covariates to make much of such a simplistic statement: they also walk much longer distances everyday.).It was not our intention to cause alarm. However, we feel that even though we had a woefully small number of samples (36), American breast feeding mothers are better off knowing that many of the women had appallingly low concentration of iodide in their breast milk  whereas 100-200 ug/L is normal and nutritionally recommended, in a third of the samples in which iodide was measured, it was below 20 ug/L. Note also that what we measured was iodide, which is only one form of iodine. There is some evidence that other forms of iodine make up to half of total iodine in breast milk.It may be disconcerting, but I believe that we are ultimately better off knowing that all of the women tested had easily measured values of perchlorate in their breast milk, some at levels that nature surely did not intend.I would hasten to add that in a paper we published a month ago, we showed that some perchlorate is formed naturally, for example, every time sea salt particles go through lightning. We can detect perchlorate in the majority of rain samples in trace quantities.I am too old to be an activist. If I were, I would write my congressperson to legislate that FDA make iodization of all food grade salt mandatory, as for example Austria has recently done. It costs nothing, especially when you think iodine deficiency causes mental retardation. As a nation, we cannot afford to fall any further behind. I would also urge my congressperson to pass legislation to clean up at least the more grievous acts of perchlorate contamination.There is nothing more beautiful than a mother breast feeding a child. I sincerely wish all your readers and their babies well.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Thank you,Purnendu K DasguptaPaul Whitfield Horn ProfessorDepartment of Chemistry and BiochemistryTexas Tech UniversityLubbock TX(revised per Dr. Dasguptas comments at 4:05 pm EST, March 3, 2005)Additional InformationIodine Nutrition in Industrialized Nations from the Network for Sustained Elimination of Iodine Deficiency.

My Views on Weaning,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/considering-weaning/weaningphilosophy/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCI think that anyone who wants to breastfeed at all (no                 matter how limited) is doing a great thing for her child. Any breastmilk                 that your baby gets  even if only for a few days or weeks  is                 going to help your baby. And although breastfeeding is very beneficial                 to your child at any age, it is most important when your baby is                 younger  when his immune system is the least developed, and when                 he is not getting significant nutrition from other sources. So I                 want to help and support anyone who is interested in breastfeeding,                 no matter how long she wishes to continue.Weaning  when and how  is a personal decision that a mother makes                 for herself and her child. I personally feel quite strongly that                 a child-led approach to weaning is best, and that is what works                 for my family. I do hope that every mom will take the needs of her                 child into consideration when it comes to weaning, and if she feels                 that mother-led weaning is best for her, that she will do this gradually,                 since its easier on both mom and baby.If I question a moms decision to wean, its because it sounds                 like she is being pushed into it by the opinions of others around                 her, or because she may not be fully informed about the benefits                 of continuing to nurse. I dont think a mom should be forced into                 weaning when she doesnt really feel that her and her baby are ready                 for it. Weaning should indeed be the mothers decision (though                 I hope that she will also follow the lead of her child). Many mothers                 wean because everyone said it was time or because its                 too hard to deal with negative comments or looks. If a mother appears                 to be unsure about weaning, I will certainly give her information                 on the many benefits of continuing to breastfeed.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.In addition, depending on a moms reasons for wanting to wean,                 there are often options  short of total weaning  that can meet                 the moms needs while still allowing her baby to get breastmilk.                 Since I feel that its important for a baby to receive breastmilk                 for at least a year, Ill first try to find a solution that                 will work for a mom and still allow her baby to nurse at least part-time. Very often, the conventional answer to many problems/difficulties                 is to wean  many women arent aware that there is often an option to weaning. I want to make sure that moms know their options. For                 example, I know several moms who weaned when they returned to work;                 they said later that they wouldnt have weaned if they had known                 there was another way. If the only acceptable solution to a mom                 is weaning, then I will support her in that decision  I just want                 to make sure that she knows about other options before she makes                 this decision.My main wish is that everyone has the information necessary to                 make informed decisions about breastfeeding. My goal is to                 offer support to breastfeeding moms, to dispel myths and to present                 the current scientific research about breastfeeding. I want all                 moms to have the information and support they need to continue breastfeeding                 as long as they wish.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Partial Weaning & Combination Feeding,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/wean-how/weaning-partial/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCBreastfeeding is not an all-or-nothing process. You can always keep one or more feedings per day and eliminate the rest. Many moms will continue to nurse only at night and/or first thing in the morning for many months after baby has weaned from all other nursings. If you wish to begin feeding your baby formula in addition to breastmilk in the early months, your chances of success are greatly increased by exclusively breastfeeding for at least the first 3-4 weeks, then slowly weaning from some of the nursing sessions.Is part-time nursing beneficial for baby?Will my milk dry up if I only nurse once or twice per day?Partial weaning as an option for working mothersIs part-time nursing beneficial for baby?Absolutely! As long as baby is getting moms milk, he will continue to receive many benefits from breastmilk and the act of breastfeeding.Benefits of partial breastfeeding include:Comfort, bonding, skin-to-skin benefitsMom can provide 100% of these even if very little breastmilk is being obtained during nursing.Oral developmentThe type of sucking required for breastfeeding improves your babys oral development (even if he gets little milk).Disease, allergy-prevention, immunological benefitsResearch has shown that the benefits of breastfeeding are generally dose-related: the more breastmilk, the greater the benefit. But even 50 ml of breastmilk per day (or less  there is little research on this) mayhelp to keep your baby healthier than if he received none at all. In fact, the immunities in moms milk have been shown to increase in concentration as the quantity of milk decreases.Nutritional benefitsThere are components of mothers milk which cannot be duplicated  even a small quantity of these can be invaluable to your baby.Will my milk dry up if I only nurse once or twice per day?Most moms find that they can wean down to a few feedings a day (or even just one) and maintain their supplies at this level for extended periods of time. In established lactation, milk production depends primarily upon milk removal  if milk is removed from the breast, then the breast will continue to make milk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Breast refusal due to flow preference is probably a greater danger to the breastfeeding relationship than too-low milk supply. Frequent use of bottles increases the possibility that baby will become frustrated with the slower flow of milk at the breast, and this may lead to breast refusal and an earlier weaning than anticipated. See What can I do when baby wants a faster milk flow? for some tips on dealing with flow preference.Partial weaning as an option for working mothersPartial weaning canbe anoption for working moms:who are unable to pump at work due to work schedule or lack of a place to pumpwho do not wish to pump at workwho have been pumping but are ready to wean from pumping during work hours (many pumping moms wean from the pump at around a year, although some continue pumping long-term).Partial weaning in a work situation generally involves offering the child formula, milk, or other foods when mom and baby are separated, and nursing only when mom and baby are together.Some of these moms encourage their child to reverse cycle (nurse more when mom and baby are together) so that few (or no) supplements are needed during work hours.Some moms feel that their supply decreases too much when they are nursing infrequently and not pumping at all. If you feel that your milk supply is decreasing after a period of no pumping during work hours, you might consider trying to pump at least once per day, even if its just for a brief period.The key to maintaining your breastfeeding relationship without pumping during work hours is to only nurse when you are with baby. For example, if you have a regular five-day-per-week daytime job, then use no bottles during the evening or on weekends. Take advantage of every opportunity to put your baby to your breast when the two of you are together. Limit pacifier use when at home, too, so that baby seeks out the breast to satisfy his need to suck. If your baby associates mom with nursing only (rather than bottle feeding), then he may be less likely to refuse the breast due to bottle/flow preference.Additional information@ Weaning (including how-to information)Weaning from the PumpIs it safe to use cows milk or other milks as a supplement to breastfeeding?Milk (human, formula, cow, goat, soy, rice)@ other websitesMaking Combination Feeding Work by Paula YountMaking it Work: Working without Pumping from New Beginnings, Vol. 17 No. 3, May-June 2000, pp. 98-99.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Night Weaning,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/wean-how/weaning-night/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC, Becky Flora, IBCLC and Paula YountBreastfeeding is not an all-or-nothing process. Night weaning is a workable alternative for many moms, and baby continues to receive the many nutritional and immunilogical benefits of breastmilk.Remember that sleeping through the night is a developmental milestone (like walking or toilet training) that different babies will reach at different times. At some point, your child will sleep through the night  even if you do nothing to encourage it.If night weaning is not going well, then consider backing off and trying again a little later. The closer your child is to reaching this milestone on his own, the easier it will be for both child and parents.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Getting your baby to sleep is not a battle to be won, as it is so often portrayed in books and the media. The real goal should be for your family to get the sleep they need, while respecting the needs of the youngest family member(s).Gentle methods for encouraging less night nursingFollowing are suggestions for easing your baby into less night nursingEliminate discomfortTeething.If you suspect teething at all, it may help to give baby a pain reliever before bedtime (check with babys doctor for suggestions). Some babies nurse more often to try to relieve gum pain. Teething pain is often worse at night.Room temperature.Find your babys temperature comfort level: some babies will wake if they get too hot or too cold.Solid foods.Has baby recently started solids? Many babies (particularly those under six months) start or increase night waking after the introduction of solids, due to problems digesting the food. Try avoiding solids in the evening, or consider decreasing or eliminating the solids until babys digestive system matures more. Several studies have shown that adding solids to a babys diet does not help baby to sleep more at night.Allergy.Babies with food allergies, environmental allergies or eczema may wake more at night due to discomfort.Reflux.Discomfort from reflux may also keep baby up at night.Illness.Illnesses like ear infections and colds can interrupt babys sleep, and result in increased night nursing. A bad diaper rash or other rash might also affect babys sleep. Anytime baby suddenly increases night waking, keep an eye out for illness.Maximize babys nursing during the day and during any night wakingsNurse more during the day.Encourage baby to nurse more often during the day (perhaps every 2 hours instead of every 3), so that she takes in more milk during the daytime hours.Minimize distractions.During the day, nurse in a room that is as free of distractions as possible. Turn off the light, close the door, pull the blinds, etc. Get your older children busy doing something before you start nursing. Try nursing while lying down. Sometimes babies can become so distracted during daytime feedings that they dont take in enough milk and then have to make up for it with more frequent night feedings. One study showed that older babies can consume as much as 25% of their total daily intake of mothers milk during the night, probably partly because of daytime distractibility.Tank up before bedtime.Nurse often in the hours leading up to bedtime (at least every 1-2 hours). Some moms nurse on one breast only during this time period so that baby gets more of the higher fat milk available at the end of a feeding (this helps baby go longer between feedings). When baby wakes at night, try nursing on the other breast for all or most of the night, again so that baby gets more of the higher-fat milk.Listen to your child.Only your child knows if shes really hungry  dont automatically assume that your child is not hungry or thirsty. Many adults wake at night for a drink of water or even to get a snack.Maximize sleep for the entire familyDream feed.Nurse baby right before you go to bed (even if baby has already gone to bed), so that you get a longer period of sleep before she wakes again. Many babies barely wake at this time, even though they may get a good nursing in.Try to begin settling baby before hes overtired.Some babies have a hard time going to sleep when theyre overtired, so keep an eye out for signs of sleepiness.Try different sleep arrangements.Find out what sleeping arrangement work best for the entire family while continuing to meet babys needs.Full-time co-sleeping.Many babies sleep better when they are close to mom. Consider sleeping close to your baby  many families have found that baby and the rest of the family gets more sleep this way (click here for information on safety). Sleeping near your baby and nursing baby to sleep will not teach bad sleep habits. All the co-sleeping babies/toddlers who I know have begun to sleep through the night at some point without any type of training or encouragement or change in sleep location.Part-time co-sleeping.Part-time co-sleeping works for many families, where baby sleeps in her crib until the first night waking and then joins mom and dad for the rest of the night.Separate beds.If youre not comfortable with baby in your bed or if you are currently sleeping with baby and no one is getting any sleep, then try other options. Consider placing baby on a pallet on the floor beside the bed, or place babys crib with the rail down beside your bed. That way, baby will be close enough that nursing wont interrupt sleep quite so much (such as when you get up each time and go to babys room). Another option that works for some families is putting a bed for just mom and baby in babys room for awhile, or Dad might instead choose to sleep in another location himself.Gentle methods of night weaning for toddlersLimit Access.After you nurse, place the baby back in her area, or slide her away from you so that close proximity doesnt encourage more frequent nursing. Wear clothing that makes it harder for baby to access your breast at night.Get Dad in on the nighttime routine!If your baby appears to be waking only for comfort during the night, she may accept Dad as the comforter (and wont expect Dad to nurse her). Dad can comfort baby in other ways, such as offering a drink, just lying next to her, holding her, etc. Dad may even be able to sleep with baby in another room with less interruption than if baby were sleeping near mom.Increase daytime contact.Allow baby unlimited nursing and cuddling during the day. Sometimes toddlers will seek out the breast more at night when they arent getting enough close cuddling during the day. Sometimes we as busy mothers, especially if we have other children, forget to pick these little ones up often during the day and just sit and cuddle with them. If you can increase this close contact during the day, she may need it less at night. If you work, night nursing may be her way of trying to reconnect with you.Talk to your child.With an older child, you may be able to explain something like this, When the sun goes down, or when we go night-night, num nums (or whatever she calls them) go night-night, too. She probably wont accept or understand this completely at first, but if you say it before bed each night and repeat it each time she awakens, in time shell get it.Just say no or later.With an older child (over 18 months), feel secure enough to say no (at least some of the time) while staying sensitive to your childs needs. At night, you might say, not now, but we will later. She may  or may not  awaken again to nurse later.Substitute other comfort measures.You also may try other things to settle her, such as a back rub, just holding and cuddling, getting her a drink of water, humming softly, etc.Is night weaning necessary to get baby to sleep through the night?People may tell you something to the effect of If you nurse your child at night (or sleep near your child, or a zillion other things), you wont be able to discontinue it in the future. This sells books, but it isnt true at all!Remember that night waking in babies and young children is temporary!Children grow out of night waking, even when we do nothing to discourage it. This period of time will be a very tiny part of your childs years with you.A childs internal timetable for sleeping through the night can vary greatly. Some parents are comfortable with letting the child lead when it comes to night weaning, but for others night nursing truly interferes with their quality of life. If night nursing is not working for you, then encourage changes while taking into account the needs of your child.Your goal is to maximize sleep for everyone, and if what youre doing works, then youve met your goal. If its not working (or stops working) then you can always do things differently. All parents find that they change the way they do things as their child grows older and reaches different developmental stages  sleep is just another thing that changes as your child grows.Additional information@ Night weaning Jack (one moms story)Nursing to Sleep and Other Comfort NursingSleeping Through the NightParenting: Nighttime & SleepWill giving formula or solids at night help baby sleep better?Read excerpts from Good Nights by Dr. Jay GordonBook Reviews@ other websitesFifteen ways to help your baby sleep by Pinky McKayRead excerpts from The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth PantleyPillow Talk: Helping your Child Get a Good Nights Sleep By Paul M.

What is weaning? When is it time to wean?,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/considering-weaning/weaning_intro/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC, Becky Flora, IBCLC and Paula YountThe word wean means a passage from one relationship to another not a loss or detachment from a relationship.The weaning process begins the first time your baby takes food from a source other than your breast  whether its formula from a bottle or mashed banana from a spoon. Weaning is the gradual replacement of breastfeeding with other foods and ways of nurturing.From a strictly medical point-of-view, the younger the baby the more important it is for him to receive breastmilk. For the premature baby, the benefits of breastmilk may be even more important than for the term baby. The more immature the baby, the greater the need for the protective features of breastmilk. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that for ideal nutrition, your baby should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, and that nursing should continue after the introduction of solids for at least 12 months and longer if mother and baby wish. The World Health Organization recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, and that breastfeeding be continued for up to two years of age or beyond. Read more here about the advantages of breastfeeding.Its a myth that the benefits of breastmilk stop at a certain point. Instead, they continue and are more significant and longer-lasting for both you and your child the longer breastfeeding continues. In fact, the antibodies in human milk are more concentrated the lesser the frequency of breastfeeding is (say with a toddler or older child). If you nurse on into your childs toddler years he wont even need cows milk as long as he receives other foods rich in protein, calcium, and fats, and nurses at least a couple of times a day. Read more here about the benefits of nursing past a year.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.All children reach an age of being ready to wean at different times. While one may be ready  or at least more willing  at 18 months, another may not be ready until closer to 2, 3 or 4 years of age. The word wean means a passage from one relationship to another  not a loss or detachment from a relationship.In ancient writings, the word wean meant to ripen  like a fruit nourished to readiness, its time to leave the vine Weaning was a joyous occasion because a weaned child was valued as a fulfilled child; a child was so filled with the basic tools of the earlier stages of development that she graduated to take on the next stage of development more independently. from The Baby Book by William Sears. MD and Martha Sears, RN, p. 187Its important to be realistic about your expectations for weaning. Stopping breastfeeding does not make mothering any easier or force your child to grow up any faster. Your baby will still demand lots of your attention; supplying this in ways other than nursing can be challenging. Breastfeeding can be a real work saver when you can count on it as a surefire way of getting a baby to quiet down or sleep. Often there are ways other than total weaning to cope with mothers feelings of restlessness or being tied down.If you choose to do so, there are many benefits to continuing to breastfeed as your baby grows into toddlerhood. This is the most natural path to follow. Babies who are allowed to wean at their own pace usually continue to nurse well past their first birthday (though this does not mean that you would be unable to wean later on if that is what you wish). As your baby learns to eat other foods and to drink from a cup, breastfeeding becomes more important for comfort and reassurance than for nourishment. When allowed to do so, children wean gradually, at their own developmental rate and when they are truly ready.All children will eventually wean, whether they are allowed to self-weanor are encouraged to wean on an earlier time frame.Additional informationWhat If I Want To Wean My Baby? by Diane Wiessinger, MS, IBCLCIs Baby Weaning or Is It a Nursing Strike? by Nancy MohrbacherWeaning and Mothers Feelings by Diane Bengson, from New Beginnings, Vol. 15 No. 6, November-December 1998, pp, 164-67Deciding When to Wean by Jeri CarrWeaning: What does it mean? by William Sears, MD and Martha Sears, RNWeaning articles from NEW BEGINNINGSNursing after the first year @ FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Frequently Asked Questions about Weaning,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/wean-how/weaning_faqs/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC, Becky Flora, IBCLC and                 Paula YountComfort measures for baby during weaningIs weaning going too fast for baby?What if baby gets sick during the weaning process?How much additional milk does baby need during the weaning process?Comfort measures for baby                 during weaningMother-led weaning can be a hard transition for your child, depending                 upon how close this is to his own natural timetable for weaning.If youre actively weaning, offer lots of cuddling, lots                 of one-on-one time, lots of kisses and hugs. Many moms who are weaning                 are often afraid to do this for fear that it might encourage their                 child to nurse again. Your child needs this to make up for                 the decreased physical contact that results from decreased nursing.                 Spend time rocking and lying with him, rubbing his back, stroking                 him, etc. Make time to hold baby and focus on him much like you                 did when you were nursing. Sit or lie down together. Look at him;                 talk to him. Do something with him. Dont watch TV, answer the phone,                 or try to do anything else. At some times, a quick cuddle may suffice                 but try to make time for at least one lengthier session together                 once a day. Let him know in every way you can that you still want                 closeness with him. Try to meet those needs that nursing meets in                 as many different ways as you possibly can. If baby expresses a strong need to nurse, dont refuse. But if                 youre in the weaning process and your baby doesnt indicate a desire                 to nurse, you may prefer not to offer, either. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Is weaning going too fast                 for baby?Watch your baby for signs of stress; hell let you know if weaning                 is going to quickly for him. Some signs that may indicate that weaning                 is going too quickly: a new or increased fear of separation increased crying, whining, clinginess, or tantrumssudden increase in night waking biting when it has never occurred a new or increased attachment to a stuffed animal, toy, or blanket new thumb or pacifier sucking stomachache, constipation, vomiting, refusal to eat new or increased withdrawal, aloofness  Dr. William Sears, in one of his books, mentions that certain behaviors                 of children; i.e. aloofness, aggression, excessive whininess, frequent                 mood swings, etc. may all be diseases of premature weaning.                 He talks of weaning as a ripening which implies a state                 of readiness. Weaning should not be a detachment from the mother                 but rather a state in which the child feels so full and so                 right that he is ready to take on other relationships and                 move on to other things. Weaning a child before his time can leave                 a child feeling unfulfilled and his sense of trust violated, according                 to Dr. Sears. Many of these behaviors, he believes, can at least                 in part be traced back to premature weaning and pushing a child                 into independence before he is completely ready. Weaning readiness is a developmental milestone and some children reach it before others. If weaning seems to                 be going too quickly for your child (or you  nursing is a two-way                 street), then theres no reason not to slow down the process or                 even back up a bit. You dont have to pick up all the nursing sessions                 again. But you can, if you want to, pick up those that your                 child seems to need the most. Or, dont offer at all, but dont                 deny him to the point that he gets desperate. Be flexible and understanding                 of your childs needs. If your child is having a hard time with weaning, then time may be the best remedy. You may find that by waiting a while longer                 your child will be more ready for this milestone and the whole process                 will be easier. Now may simply not be the right time.What if baby gets sick during                 the weaning process?Its very normal for nursing children to want to nurse more often                 when ill. Breastfeeding provides them with fluids and nutrition                 that they many times refuse from other sources when ill. Children                 who are not nursing are sometimes at risk of dehydration during                 an illness because they refuse to drink. This is rare for                 the nursing child (one of the many benefits of continuing to nurse                 into toddlerhood!). Nursing is also very comforting to your child                 at a time when he feels bad. More here on nursing                 when baby is sick.We normally would never encourage a mother to initiate or progress                 with weaning when a child is sick. Weaning during a good time, when                 your child is well, is a drastic change for the child, especially                 if he is not ready. Weaning while he is ill and not feeling like                 himself is even more drastic.If your child gets sick during the weaning process, seriously consider                 allowing him to nurse as he needs until he is well again. Continued,                 unrestricted nursing will probably speed the healing process and                 to be honest, theres really no better way to comfort an ill toddler                 than nursing. Once hes recovered, you can take more deliberate                 approaches to weaning.How much additional milk                 does baby need during the weaning process?If your baby is older than 9-10 months and still breastfeeds regularly                 (at least a few times a day), and is expanding his interest in solid                 foods, he does not require any additional milk (formula,                 cows milk, soy milk, rice milk or the equivalent nutrients from                 other foods). Instead of additional milk you can offer your child solids, with                 water or juice (no more than 3-4 ounces a day) and any expressed                 milk you may have stored. The dairy industry has done a great job at convincing us that our                 diet is lacking in something if we dont drink cows milk! Cows                 milk is really just a convenient source of calcium and other                 nutrients  its not required. There are many people in many                 parts of the world who do not drink cows milk and still manage                 to get all the calcium,                 protein, fats, vitamin D,                 etc. that milk has to offer. Too much cows milk in a childs diet                 can (1) put him at risk for iron-deficiency anemia (because cows                 milk can interfere with the absorption of iron) and (2) decrease                 the childs desire for other foods.  After the age of 12 months (or sometimes                 later, depending upon your child), milk becomes a more minor                 part of your childs diet. If you have a child who refuses to drink                 regular milk and is no longer nursing regularly, you can offer yogurt,                 cheese, and ice-cream as substitutes. Also, you might put milk into                 various food products: pancakes, waffles, French toast, scrambled                 eggs, mashed potatoes, and baked goods. Added protein may be offered                 via creamy peanut butter and a well-cooked egg yolk; calcium may                 be derived from calcium-fortified juice or green vegetables.

Weaning: How does it happen?,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/considering-weaning/how_weaning_happens/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC, Becky Flora, IBCLC and Paula YountChild-led WeaningMother-led WeaningSudden Weaning (cold-turkey)Gradual WeaningPartial WeaningChild-led WeaningChild-led weaning occurs when a child no longer has a need to nurse  nutritionally or emotionally. A baby who self-weans is usually well over a year old, is getting most of his nutrition from solids, is drinking well from a cup, and cuts down on nursing gradually. If children are truly allowed to self-wean in their own time, most will do so somewhere between the 2nd and 4th year. Obviously, some will wean before this time and some will wean after this time, too.Additional InformationWhat is child-led weaning like? @ Do Babies Under 12 Months Self-Wean? @ Is Baby Weaning or Is It a Nursing Strike? by Nancy MohrbacherWeaning as a Natural Process by Brylin HightonA Natural Age of Weaning by Katherine Dettwyler, PhDBaby-Led WeaningWhat Does It Mean? by Lynette QuigleyA Time to Wean by Katherine Dettwyler, PhDLetting Go: A Weaning Story by Lu Hanessian Weaning Ages in a Sample of American Women Who Practice Extended Breastfeeding by Muriel Sugarman, MD & Kathleen A. Kendall-Tackett, PhD, IBCLCMother-led WeaningIf you feel that you need to encourage weaning before your baby is truly ready, it is possible to gently and lovingly help your child along the way, while at the same time remaining as flexible and as respectful to his needs as possible. Some children, even though theyre not truly ready, can be gently weaned without too much of a protest. Its important to always conduct mother-led weaning in a way that is gentle, gradual, flexible, patient, and as respectful to your childs needs as possible. Be aware of any signs that the weaning process is going too quickly for your child and be ready to slow things down some if necessary.If you want to take an active approach to weaning before baby show signs on his own, you might consider waiting until at least the age of 18 months. At this age most children can be told no and asked to wait on nursing more easily than a younger child can.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Sudden WeaningStopping breastfeeding abruptly, or cold turkey, can be very distressing for both mother and baby and can cause plugged ducts, breast infection, or even a breast abscess. Hormone levels are also more likely to take a drastic plunge, causing mood swings, depression, etc. Its very rare that sudden weaning is truly necessary. If someone suggests to you that this is required, get a second opinion. It would also be helpful to talk to a lactation consultant and/or a La Leche League Leader, who will be able to suggest alternatives and, if necessary, help you to wean with as little distress to mom and baby as possible.Additional InformationIs weaning really necessary? @ Lactation suppression @ Helping a Toddler Adjust to Sudden Weaning from New Beginnings, Vol. 16 No. 5 September October 1999 pp. 186-187.Weaning by Angie SohlerGradual WeaningGradual weaning allows you to gradually substitute other kinds of nutrition, affection and attention to compensate for the loss of nursing. Gradual weaning also allows the immunity levels in your breast milk to increase (as overall milk supply decreases) and thus give your child a last bit of extra protection against infection. Weaning should occur as slowly as your situation permits to make it easier on both you and your child.How long weaning takes depends upon too many variables to predict. Be as patient and as flexible as you possibly can. Weaning will happen, but you may feel at times that youre taking one step forward and two steps back. When youre actively weaning, be sure to offer lots of cuddling and extra affection during the day. As your child grows older, nursing becomes much more than a way to satisfy hunger and thirst. It provides him with much comfort, security and closeness, so be as sensitive to his needs as you possibly can be throughout the process.Additional informationWeaning @ Partial WeaningWeaning is not an all-or-nothing process.

The Many Benefits of Breastfeeding (Resources),http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/bf-benefits/,"Position Statements Comprehensive Lists of BenefitsMedical Benefits Info and Studies on Specific BenefitsPosition StatementsAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement: Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk.The AAP outlines 15 recommended breastfeeding practices and a number of statements on the role of pediatricians in promoting and protecting breastfeeding. Among other things, they recommend that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months and that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired.American Dietetic Association Position Statement: Breaking the barriers to breastfeeding It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) that broad-based efforts are needed to break the barriers to breastfeeding initiation and duration. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and breastfeeding with complementary foods for at least 12 months is the ideal feeding pattern for infants. Increases in initiation and duration are needed to realize the health, nutritional, immunological, psychological, economical, and environmental benefits of breastfeeding.The American Academy of Family Physicians Position Paper on BreastfeedingBreastfeeding should ideally continue beyond infancy, but this is currently not the cultural norm and requires ongoing support and encouragement. Breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy is not unusual. If the pregnancy is normal and the mother is healthy, breastfeeding during pregnancy is the womans personal decision. If the child is younger than two years of age, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned.

Infants should be introduced to nutrient-rich, solid foods with particular attention to iron at six months with continued breastfeeding for up to two years and beyond.The World Health Organization (WHO)Breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; it is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers. As a global public health recommendation, infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Thereafter, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues for up to two years of age or beyond. Exclusive breastfeeding from birth is possible except for a few medical conditions, and unrestricted exclusive breastfeeding results in ample milk production.UNICEFThe aim is to create an environment globally that empowers women to begin skin-to-skin with her baby and breastfeed after birth, to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months and to continue to breastfeed for two years or more with age appropriate, responsive complementary feeding.Address of Pope John Paul II on Breastfeeding.

A recent study (see below) shows that babies who were breastfed by their mothers for more than eight weeks were less likely to die from sudden infant death syndrome. After eliminating other factors know to affect SIDS risk, such as sleeping position, income, maternal smoking, and the babys age, researchers found babies who were breastfed for less than eight weeks were between three and five times more likely to die from SIDS than babies who were breastfed for four or more months. But the study authors point out that the protective effect of breastfeeding is minor in comparison to the well-proven reduction in SIDS risk provided by putting babies to sleep on their backs.Alm B, et al.

The new study, by researchers at the University of Minnesota Cancer Center (published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute), found that the longer babies were breast-fed, the more they were protected. For babies breast-fed for at least one month, the leukemia risk was reduced by 21 percent, while the risk was reduced by up to 30 percent for infants breast-fed for six months or longer, the study found.

The study indicated that the breast milk nutrients, taste, and the infants contact behavior associated with breastfeeding moderates the pain caused by a vaccination injection as long as it is given when the infant is suckling. The researchers studied the babies facial expressions during injections to discover the tolerance differences between receiving the shot before or after and during breastfeeding. The findings were presented Monday at the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academics Society in Baltimore.Psychological factorsBreast-Feeding Mothers Less Likely to Abuse Kids. The longer the mother breast-fed her infant, the less likely her risk of being reported for subsequent abuse, Dr. Lane Strathearn of the Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston told Reuters Health. Strathearn added that breast-feeding also appeared to be related to the severity of abuse inflicted on children. The shorter the period of time women spent breast-feeding, the more likely their children were to suffer the most severe forms of neglect and physical abuse. The researcher bases his conclusions on surveys of 7,695 mothers about how long they breast-fed their infants. Time periods ranged from not at all to longer than 6 months. Data were then collected over 14 years to see if the children became the subject of any reports of abuse. These research findings were presented Wednesday, July 10, 2002 at the 14th International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect in Denver, Colorado (see the link for more details).Nursing Can Lower Rates of Infant Abandonment.

Another source also indicates that shaking has the potential to destroy the protein structure of large proteins in biologically active substances: many large proteins cannot be shaken to reconstitute, as shaking can destroy the protein structure(Morrow T, Felcone LH.Defining the difference: What Makes Biologics Unique. Biotechnol Healthc. 2004;1(4):24-9). How likely is this to be an issue? We dont know! So far there has not been research done on the bioactive properties of shaken vs. non-shaken breastmilk (fun research project  any takers?). Some feel that the forces required to change the milk are significantly more than could be provided via shaking. Others note that shear forces from shaking are not the only issuebursting of bubbles caused by shaking may also damage cells or denature proteins. To play it safe, use the smallest amount of force needed to mix the layers, keeping in mind that the layers will mix better as the milk warms. If you do shake the milk, it might not be a problem at alland even if it turns out that shaking makes a difference it will still be the best nutrition for your child.Travelling with Breast Milkby Robyn Roche-Paull, BSN, RNC-MNN, IBCLCTraveling as a Pumping Mother by Nicole GoodmanPackaging and Shipping Frozen Breastmilk from Breastfeeding in Combat BootsUsing Dry Ice Safely when Traveling with Breastmilk from the Childrens Hospital of PhiladelphiaJeffery SL, Cubison TC, Greenaway C, Gilbert PM, Parkhouse N.

My expressed breastmilk doesn’t smell fresh. What can I do?,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/milkstorage/lipase-expressedmilk/,"Human milk that has truly soured has a very distinct sour taste and odor  much like soured cows milk. If your milk doesnt smell distinctly sour or rancid, then it should be safe to feed to your baby.First, troubleshoot your storage proceduresIf you repeatedly notice that your stored milk doesnt smell or taste fresh, it might help to go through your storage procedures to see if there is something you could do to improve the smell/taste of your milk:Storage containers: Standard glass or plastic bottles (or any type of leak-proof food storage containers) are acceptable for storing mothers milk, as are disposable bottle liners or mothers milk bags. The best materials are glass or food-grade polypropylene or polybutylene (hard) plastic. Polyethylene bags (bottle liners) do not preserve nutrients and immune properties as well as glass or hard plastic. (Jones & Tully 2005)If youre using standard plastic bottle liners, instead try using bags specifically designed for storing human milk.If youre storing in plastic, try glass instead.Storage conditions:Do you plan to freeze the milk? If youre not expecting to use refrigerated milk within 5-8 days of expression, then freeze as soon as possible after expression. Use as soon as possible after thawing (but always within 24 hours).Make sure that all packages in your refrigerator or freezer are sealed well, so that your milk cannot absorb odors from other foods. A box of baking soda placed in the refrigerator or freezer may help to absorb odors.Store your milk in the BACK of the refrigerator or freezer, not in the door. Dont store your milk against the wall of a self-defrosting freezer.Is your freezer cold enough? If your freezer keeps ice cream hard, then the temperature is right.Does your milk smell or taste soapy?A few mothers find that their refrigerated or frozen milk begins to smell or taste soapy, even though all storage guidelines have been followed closely. Per Lawrence & Lawrence (p. 781), the speculation is that these mothers have an excess of the enzyme lipase in their milk, which begins to break down the milk fat soon after the milk is expressed. Most babies do not mind a mild change in taste, and the milk is not harmful, but the stronger the taste the more likely that baby will reject it.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Lipase is an enzyme that is normally present in human milk and has several known beneficial functions:Lipases help keep milk fat well-mixed (emulsified) with the whey portion of the milk, and also keep the fat globules small so that they are easily digestible (Lawrence & Lawrence, p. 156).Lipases also help to break down fats in the milk, so that fat soluble nutrients (vitamins A & D, for example) and free fatty acids (which help to protect baby from illness) are easily available to baby (Lawrence & Lawrence, p. 156).The primary lipase in human milk, bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), has been found to be the major factor inactivating protozoans (Lawrence & Lawrence, p. 203).Per Lawrence & Lawrence (p. 158), the amount of BSSL in a particular mothers milk does not vary during a feed, and is not different at different times of day or different stages of lactation. There is evidence that there may be a decrease in lipase activity over time in mothers who are malnourished.Many mothers who need to store their expressed milk but have problems with excess lipase sometimes wonder whether changing their diets may help. This post to the LLLI forums discusses some ideas from human milk researcher Leon Mitoulas about this question: Can diet changes help with the Lipase issue?What can I do if my storage problem is due to excess lipase? Once the milk becomes sour or rancid smelling/tasting, there is no known way to salvage it. However, newly expressed milk can be stored by heating the milk to a scald to inactivate the lipase and stop the process of fat digestion. Scald the milk as soon after expression as possible.To scald milk:Heat milk to about 180 F (82 C), or until you see little bubbles around the edge of the pan (not to a full, rolling boil).Quickly cool and store the milk.Scalding the milk will destroy some of the antiinfective properties of the milk and may lower some nutrient levels, but this is not likely to be an issue unless all of the milk that baby is receiving has been heat-treated.Per Lawrence & Lawrence, bile salt-stimulated lipase can also be destroyed by heating the milk at 144.5 F (62.5 C) for one minute (p. 205), or at 163 F (72 C) for up to 15 seconds (p. 771).What if your milk tastes/smells sour, or even rancid, rather than soapy?If your milk tastes/smells sour or rancid rather than soapy, the cause may be chemical oxidation rather than lipase (Mohrbacher, p. 461). Moms intake of polyunsaturated fats may be involved, or free copper or iron ions in her water. When this happens, Mohrbacher has a few suggestions to try:avoid your usual drinking water (either drinking it or having milk come into contact with it)avoid fish-oil and flaxseed supplements, and foods like anchovies that contain rancid fatsincrease your antioxidant intake (including beta carotene and vitamin E).If you have frozen milk in your freezer that your child refusesSome options:Try mixing the rejected frozen milk with fresh milk. Start with half frozen, half fresh and adjust the amount of frozen milk up or down depending on your childs preferences.Consider donating your frozen milk to a milk bank. Lipase and other taste issues are not typically an problem for milk banks.

How to bottle feed the breastfed baby,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/feeding-tools/bottle-feeding/,"paced bottle feeding tips for a breastfeeding supportive style of bottle feedingPDF version (great for child care providers)by Eva Lyford. Reprinted with permission from the author.Often, as infant feeding specialists, lactation consultants and other experts in the field of human lactation are asked how to properly bottle-feed a baby. Direct breastmilk feedings from the mothers breast are always preferred to any artificial source or substance. In addition, there are often alternatives to bottle-feeding, such as cup feeding, which should be explored. For the baby who has to be bottle-fed, following is some information to help make the experience a good one for the baby and also to make sure that breastfeeding is fully supported even when artificial feedings are used. This information can also be useful in evaluating infant care providers and for instructing them on how to bottle-feed a breastfed infant. Note that when working through any feeding difficulties with an infant, a lactation consultant is an excellent resource for evaluating methods for their appropriateness to the specific situation. While useful for any bottle-fed infant, this information is particularly targeted towards infants under 6 months of age. Babies should be bottle-fed:When their cues indicate hunger, rather than on a schedule.Held in an upright position; it is especially important to avoid letting the baby drink from a bottle when lying down. Such a position is associated with bottle caries and an increased frequency of ear infections. Note also that babies should be held often at times when they are not being fed, to avoid the baby being trained to eat in order to be held.With a switch from one side to the other side midway through a feed; this provides for eye stimulation and development, and thwarts the development of a side preference which could impact the breastfeeding mother.For 10-20 minutes at a time, to mimic the usual breastfeeding experience. Care providers should be encouraged to make appropriate quantities last the average length of a feeding, rather than trying to feed as much as they can in as short a time as possible. This time element is significant because the infants system needs time to recognize satiety, long before the stomach has a chance to get over-filled.Gently, allowing the infant to draw nipple into mouth rather than pushing the nipple into the infants mouth, so that baby controls when the feed begins. Stroke babys lips from top to bottom with the nipple to illicit a rooting response of a wide open mouth, and then allow the baby to accept the nipple rather than poking it in.Consistent with a breastfed rhythm; the caregiver should encourage frequent pauses while the baby drinks from the bottle to mimic the breastfeeding mothers let-down patterns. This discourages the baby from guzzling the bottle and can mitigate nipple confusion or preference.To satiation, so that baby is not aggressively encouraged to finish the last bit of milk in the bottle by such measures as forcing the nipple into the mouth, massaging the infants jaw or throat, or rattling the nipple around in the infants mouth. If baby is drowsing off and releasing the bottle nipple before the bottle is empty that means baby is done; dont reawaken the baby to finish.The benefits of bottle-feeding in this manner:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The infant will consume a volume appropriate to their size and age, rather than over- or under-eating. This can support the working and pumping mom who then has an increased likelihood of pumping a daily volume equivalent to the babys demand.This can minimize colic-like symptoms in the baby whose stomach is distended or over-fed.It supports the breastfeeding relationship, hopefully leading to longer durations and increased success at breastfeeding particularly for mothers who are separated from their nurslings either intermittently or recurrently.Bottle feeding Myth 1: Bottle feeding lets me know how much nutrition the baby has had.Moms who bottle-feed, whether using expressed breast milk or anything else, should be aware that while artificial feeding may seem to be a very accurate measure of volume consumed, in fact it is often not. Bottle-fed infants more often regurgitate some quantity of a feed, or get a less than perfect balance of fore and hind milk than they might if feeding directly from the breast. If a substance other than breastmilk is used, the increased metabolic workload for the baby, lower digestibility of nutrients and increased waste substantially dilute the benefit of a feed, although it is more easily measured.Bottle feeding Myth 2: It is simple to bottle-feed safely.Bottle-feeding caregivers face certain challenges in feeding a baby safely.Wash hands before handling bottles or feeding baby.Wash bottles and nipples/teats with hot water and soap, and rinse well. Some sources recommend sterilization of all feeding equipment, particularly bottle nipples/teats.If infant formula is used:Wash, rinse, and dry the top of the formula can before you open it. Make sure that all equipment used has been thoroughly cleaned: can opener, measuring cups/spoons, mixing container, etc.Lot numbers should be kept for any infant formula or bottled water fed to the baby, so that parents can determine whether the product was subject to a recall.For powdered formula, a clean source of water must be available, free from bacteria. If tap water is used, the caregiver must decide whether to boil the water to eliminate bacteria (which may concentrate any heavy metals in the water), or to use unboiled water. Because powdered infant formula is not sterile, it should be mixed with water that is at least 70C/158F to kill any harmful bacteria that may be present in the formula (to reduce the risk of infection, do not mix with cooled watereven if it is bottled or has already been boiled). Cool formula before feeding to baby.Quantities the baby will need should be carefully estimated, since unused formula must be discarded after the feed.If you are using both breastmilk and infant formula during the same feed, its best not to mix them in the same bottle. This is simply to avoid wasting breastmilk when baby does not finish the bottle (since it contains formula, contents must be discarded at the end of the feed). Feed the breastmilk, then follow with formula.More information here from the American Academy of Pediatrics and UNICEF UKFor more information on infant feeding myths, see Dr. Jack Newmans Breastfeeding MythsAdditional resourcesThere are a number of options for feeding baby when you are unable to directly breastfeed  a bottle is only one of them.

Is Breastfeeding Linked to Tooth Decay?,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/tooth-decay/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage courtesy of Ran Yaniv Hartstein / flickr.comIts often said that breastfeeding (particularly while lying down at night) will cause tooth decay, just like letting a baby sleep with a bottle of milk can cause baby bottle mouth. Essentially, a valid link has not been made between breastfeeding (nighttime or otherwise) and cavities. However, breastfed babies can certainly get cavities, sogood dental hygiene is important.Before the use of the baby bottle, dental decay in baby teeth was rare. Two dentists, Dr. Brian Palmer and Dr. Harold Torney, have done extensive research on human skulls (from 500-1000 years ago) in their study of tooth decay in children. Of course these children were breastfed, probably for an extended length of time. Their research has led them to conclude that breastfeeding does not cause tooth decay.One of the reasons for nighttime bottles causing tooth decay is the pooling of the liquid in babys mouth (where the milk/juice bathes babys teeth for long periods of time). Breastmilk is not thought to pool in the babys mouth in the same way as bottled milk because the milk doesnt flow unless the baby is actively sucking. Also, milk from the breast enters the babys mouth behind the teeth. If the baby is actively sucking then he is also swallowing, so pooling breast milk in the babys mouth appears not to be an issue.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.A bacteria (present in plaque) called Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans, or strep mutans)is thought to be the primary cause of tooth decay. These bacteria use food sugars to produce acid  this acid directly causes the decay. Strep mutans thrives in a combination of sugars, low amounts of saliva and a low ph-level in the saliva. A portion of the population (around 20%) is thought to have increased levels of this high acid producing bacteria, putting them at higher risk for developing dental decay. After your baby gets teeth, he can get this bacteria through saliva to saliva contact from mother (or other caregiver) to baby. To help prevent transfer of this bacteria to baby, avoid any saliva to saliva contact such as sharing spoons & cups, wet kisses on the mouth, chewing food for baby, or putting babys pacifier in your mouth. On the other hand, one study indicates that children of moms with high levels of strep mutans may actually have some protection (immunization) from decay through frequent saliva to saliva contact in the months before babys teeth erupt.Per Brian Palmer, Human milk alone does not cause dental caries. Infants exclusively breastfed are not immune to decay due to other factors that impact the infants risk for tooth decay. Decay causing bacteria (streptococcus mutans) is transmitted to the infant by way of parents, caregivers, and others (Palmer 2002).Until relatively recently, the only studies that had been done were on the effects of lactose (milk sugar, which breastmilk does contain) on teeth, not the effects of complete breastmilk with all its components. Breastmilk also contains lactoferrin, a component in breastmilk that actually kills strep mutans (the bacteria that causes tooth decay). A study in the March/April 1999 issue of Pediatric Dentistry utilized extracted teeth to obtain most of its results and studied children only for determining the pH changes in dental plaque (Erickson 1999)  this study concluded that human breast milk is not cariogenic.A Finnish study could not find any correlation between caries and breastfeeding among children who were breastfed longer (up to 34 months) (Alaluusua 1990). Valaitis et al concluded, In a systematic review of the research on early childhood caries, methodology, variables, definitions, and risk factors have not been consistently evaluated. There is not a constant or strong relationship between breastfeeding and the development of dental caries. There is no right time to stop breastfeeding, and mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed as long as they wish. (Valaitis 2000). Another review in 2013 (Lavigne 2013),revealed that there was no conclusive evidence that prolongedbreastfeeding increased the risk of early childhood cavities.In an unpublished masters thesis by Dr. Torney (Torney, 1992), no correlation was found between early onset (< 2 yrs) dental caries and breastfeeding patterns such as frequent night feeds, feeding to sleep, etc. He is convinced that under normal circumstances, the antibodies in breastmilk counteract the bacteria in the mouth that cause decay. However, if there are small defects in the enamel, the teeth become more vulnerable and the protective effect of breastmilk is not enough to counteract the combined effect of the bacteria and the sugars in the milk. Enamel defects occur when the first teeth are forming in utero. His explanation is based on quite a large study of long-term breastfed children with and without caries.According to this research, a baby who is exclusively breastfed (no supplemental bottles, juice, or solids) will not have decay unless he is genetically predisposed, i.e.. soft or no enamel. In a baby who does have a genetic problem, weaning will not slow down the rate of decay and may speed it up due to lack of lactoferrin.Much research indicates that its the other foods in babys diet (rather than breastmilk) that tend to be the main problem when it comes to tooth decay. The 1999 Erickson study (in which healthy teeth were immersed in different solutions) indicated that breastmilk alone was practically identical to water and did not cause tooth decay  another experiment even indicated that the teeth became stronger when immersed in breastmilk. However, when a small amount of sugar was added to the breastmilk, the mixture was worse than a sugar solution when it came to causing tooth decay. This study emphasizes the importance of tooth brushing and good dental hygiene.In summary:Although breastfed childrencan get cavities, breastmilk alone does not appear to be the cause.Foodsother than breastmilk tend to be the main problem.Some childrenare at a higher risk of tooth decaydue to small defects in the tooth enamel and/or increased levels of decay-causingstrep mutansbacteria. In these children, weaning is not likely to slow the decay, and may evenspeed it up due to the lack of lactoferrin (a component in breastmilk thatkills strep mutans).What can parents do to help their childavoid tooth decay?Accustom your child to oral carefrom birth by gentlycleaningthe gums with water and a soft cloth or gauze.Cleanyour childs teeth twice a day (morning and night) as soon as teeth begin to appear.Take care of your own mouth  this reduces the amount of bacteria transmitted to your child. See this article for some suggestions for reducing the amount of decay-causing bacteria.If your child is getting anything other than breastmilk (including medications), clean teeth well before bedtime. Breastmilk combined with sugaris worse than sugaralonewhen it comes to tooth decay, so you want to make sure no other foods are left on babys teeth if you will be breastfeeding throughthe night.It may be helpful foryour child tosip water after meals to help wash food particles away.Reducethe amount of timethat sugary substances contact the teeth. Dont allow baby to carry a cup or a bottle around during the day. This results in a constant bathing of babys teeth with whatever hes drinking. Avoid too many sugary, sticky foods as well.What about fluoride?Some parents and health care professionals prefer to avoid fluoride; others feel that it can be helpful. The American Dental Associationcurrently recommends usinga smear of fluoride-containing toothpaste or an amount about the size of a grain of rice for children under 3 years old.If youre wondering about fluoride supplementation, talk to your dentist about the amount of fluoride in your drinking waterread more about fluoride supplements for babies here: Does My Baby Need Vitamins?Links to additional informationTaking Care of Your Breastfed Babys Teeth byAmy Peterson BS, IBCLC, and Scott Chandler, DMDBreastfeeding and tooth decay from the Australian Breastfeeding AssociationBreastfeeding and Dental/Oral Health from La Leche League GBEarly Childhood Caries: New Knowledge Has Implications for Breastfeeding Families, by Anne Altshuler, RN, MS, IBCLC, from LEAVEN, Vol. 42 No. 2, April-May-June 2006, pp. 27-31.1.La Leche League International articles:Breastfeeding and Dental HealthBig Bad Cavities: Breastfeeding Is Not the Cause by Lisa Reagan, from Mothering Issue 113, July/August 2002Infant Dental Decay  Is it related to Breastfeeding? by Brian Palmer, DDS These are the notes for one of Dr. Palmers slide presentations.Breastfeeding and Infant Caries: No Connection by Brian Palmer, DDS Published in: ABM NEWS and VIEWS, The Newsletter of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2000, Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec), p27 & 3Very Young Kids Teeth  Yahoo email group for parents to share experience and information about dealing with issues with their young childrens teeth and dental health.

Why are my nipples sore after months of pain-free nursing?,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/sorenipples-older/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCSometimes a mom will get sore nipples after weeks or months with no problems. Following are six potential causes, plus some troubleshooting tips.1. BlockageMastitis or a plugged duct or a milk blister is a possibility, particularly if only one breast/nipple or area of the breast is sore. Its unusual to have mastitis, plugged duct, or a milk blister on both sides at once.2.Hormonal changesAre you ovulating or about to get your period? The hormonal changes at these times can cause sore nipples for a few days. Typically, both sides will be sore. Many moms of older babies are more bothered with latch on during these times, and it may feel as if baby is clamping down or scraping his teeth on the nipple, even though he doesnt seem to have changed his latch. Mom may also feel generally uncomfortable and even irritated with nursing. Some moms get relief from the soreness by taking evening primrose oil or a calcium/magnesium supplement.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Any chance of pregnancy? Often the first sign of pregnancy for nursing moms is sore nipples. More here on pregnancy and breastfeeding. As with soreness that comes with ovulation or menstruation, both sides will typically be sore since the soreness is caused by hormonal changes.3. TraumaHas your baby been pulling on the nipple, biting, scraping teeth or leaving tooth indentations or practicing creative nursing positions? Any type of nipple trauma can cause soreness, and soreness may be on one or both sides. Any broken skin will also make you more vulnerable to bacterial infections.4. Skin irritationIs baby teething? Many times moms experience nipple irritation as a result of teething. The increased saliva and the enzymes in it can irritate nipples. This can be lessened by rinsing the babys saliva off the nipples after the feeding. With teething, both sides would typically be sore.Has baby started solids? Remnants of food left in babys mouth can also cause soreness. Rinse babys mouth or give him a sip of water before nursing.Are you prone to getting eczema or psoriasis? Either can cause nipple soreness.Are you using a new soap, laundry detergent, nipple ointment/cream, skin lotion, shampoo, powder, hair spray, perfume or deodorant? An allergic reaction to any of these might cause sore nipples.Have you been exposed to poison ivy?5. ThrushIfyou get sore or cracked nipples all of a sudden, it can be useful to check for thrush symptoms. Thrush usually causes pain in both sides.6. Latch and positioningAny time you experience soreness, go back to the basics of positioning and latch just as you did in the early days. Even if you have not had problems with this in the past, latching/positioning can occasionally be a problem as baby gets older because older babies usually nurse in all kinds of positions, and the latch can get sort of sloppy too. One or both sides may be sore. Improving latching/positioning may be helpful even if there is another primary cause of the soreness. For example, many moms experience sore nipples when pregnant and although this has a hormonal cause, good positioning and latch can still improve the soreness to some extent.Following are general treatment measures for sore nipples:Sore nipples or breasts?

A technical article by Lisa Marasco, BA, IBCLC and Jan Barger, MA, RN, IBCLC. Babies, most especially breastfed babies, need to be fed on cue and should be allowed to set their own routine, rather than placed into a predetermined schedule. It is our further conclusion that practices which interfere with respecting babies cues have been responsible for low weight gains, failure to thrive, milk supply failure, involuntary early weaning, and possibly even some cases of colic, not to mention infant regression and depression due to lack of parental responsiveness to babys frantic cues.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Milk Secretion: An Overview by Margaret C.

Q&A: Preventing Thrush,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/child/preventing-thrush/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCQUESTION:I need to take an antibiotic, and I know that this increases my risk of developing thrush. Is there anything I can do to reduce this risk?ANSWER:Yes, anytime mom or baby needs to take antibiotics, it may be helpful to use probiotics (acidophus, etc.) as a preventative. There is evidence in the medical literature that probiotics can decrease the risk of candida overgrowth (Drisko 2003, Payne 2003, Kopp-Hoolihan 2001, Lykova 2000). Antibiotics increase the risk of thrush and other yeast infections because they tend to kill off the good bacteria along with the bad. These good bacteria are what normally prevent an overgrowth of the yeast (candida) that is always present in our bodies. By taking probiotics, you replace some of the good bacteria in your digestive tract that are needed to prevent a yeast overgrowth.What are probiotics?What kind of probiotic should I look for?DosageSome ways to treat babyWhen and how long?SafetyAdditional informationUseful referencesWhat are probiotics?Probiotics are friendly or good bacteria that are normally present in our bodies and help to prevent the overgrowth of harmful organisms. Examples of probiotics include Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, etc. We often hear only about Lactobacillus acidophilus (often simply called acidophilus), which is the most common probiotic, but there are many different probiotic preparations. Bifidobacteria are the predominant bacteria in the intestinal tract of breastfed infants and thus would be a good probiotic choice for an infant or young child.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.It may also be helpful to take prebiotics in addition to the probiotics. Prebiotics are soluble fibers that stimulate the growth of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of prebiotics include inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS). The term synbiotic is used when probiotics and prebiotics are combined in the same product.What kind of probiotic should I look for?The most common variety of probiotic is Lactobacillus acidophilus, but there are other formulations available. For baby, consider a variety that contains more Bifidobacteria than Lactobacillus.Dairy-free formulations are available.Many probiotics require refrigeration. Check the label for storage directions.You can also eat yogurt or other dairy products with live acidophilus cultures. Unsweetened is best, since sugar feeds the yeast.DosageProbiotics are generally measured in billions of active cultures rather than milligrams (mg). The number of active cultures varies widely from brand to brand.Various dosage recommendations range from 10-40+ billion active cultures per day. Daily maintenance dosages commonly range from 2-5 billion active cultures per day.Most sources suggest that both mom and baby take probiotics. Check your label for baby dosage  it commonly ranges from 1-3 billion active cultures per day.Many recommend that you start with a lower dosage, and increase it after a week or so.Some ways to treat babyOpen the capsule, dip your clean finger in the powder and let baby suck it off; orMix the powder with a small amount of expressed milk or water; orMake a paste of the powder with expressed milk or water and swab it in babys mouth; orAdd to solid food (for babies over 6 months).When and how long?Take the probiotics between antibiotic doses (remember that antibiotics can kill these good bacteria). Some recommend waiting two hours after taking the antibiotic.Continue with the probiotics during the time you are taking the antibiotics and for 1-2 weeks after.SafetyVarious probiotics have been used safely in infants (including premature infants), children and adults for many years. Many of these probiotics are found naturally in the GI tract. Some people who take more than 1-2 billion active cultures per day experience mild GI upset (thus the suggestion to start with a lower dosage and increase after a week or so).Prebiotics: Some people experience GI effects, especially if the dosage is high. There have been reports of anaphylaxis in one person following IV administration of the prebiotic inulin, and in another person who consumed large amounts of inulin from multiple sources. These anaphylactic sensitivities are very rare.Per SK Dash in Selection criteria for probiotic supplements:Lactic acid bacteria have a long history of safe use in dairy products. However, some probiotic supplements now contain bacteria, which have no record of safe use in humans or even animals. There are instances of probiotic supplements containing soil bacteria that are not normal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract. These cultures may potentially be pathogenic. It is imperative to select bacteria for incorporation in probiotic supplements that are on the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) list. L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium species are normal inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract and are GRAS. Probiotic formulations containing these beneficial bacteria along with prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are considered safe.Additional informationPreventing and treating the side effects of antibiotics from AskDrSears.comIdentifying and Treating Thrush by Cheryl Taylor White, CBEAcidophilus from AskDrSears.comLactobacillus Acidophilus from wikipediaProbiotics from PeaceHealthFructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and Other Oligosaccharides from PeaceHealthProbiotics Basics from usprobiotics.org (sponsored by the California Dairy Research Foundation)Thrush Resources @ Useful referencesYoung RJ, Huffman S.

Recurrent Mastitis or Plugged Ducts,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/recurrent-mastitis/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCRisk factors for recurrent plugged ducts or mastitisMost mothers do not have repeated bouts of mastitis or plugged ducts, but when there is a history its always a good idea to look at additional risk factors. Make sure that you are aware of the symptoms of plugged ducts and mastitis so you can start treatment immediately. See Mastitis and Plugged Ducts for more information.Risk factor: Inadequate treatment of previous mastitisA major risk factor for recurring mastitis is failure to completely recover from a previous bout of mastitis due to slow treatment, incorrect treatment (wrong antibiotic, for example), or treatment that was not long enough. Has the treatment of previous bouts of mastitis been delayed, inadequate or incomplete? If you were treated for a previous bout of mastitis, did you take a complete course of antibiotics? Have you had repeated prescriptions for the same antibiotic? Amoxil is often ineffective against the bacteria that causes mastitis. Some of the drugs of choice for treating this are Keflex, Dicloxacillin, and Erythromycin. Treatment should continue for 10-14 days. See the links below for additional information.In addition, some moms get recurrent plugged ducts due to inflammation from an ongoing subclinical case of mastitis.A related risk factor is a previous plugged duct. The duct can be deformed (stretched out a bit) at the location of a previous plug, which can put that particular area more at risk for plugging in the future. To reduce this risk, be vigilant about keeping the milk flowing well after a plugged duct is resolved.Risk factor: Poor milk drainageAre latch-on and positioning optimal? Problems with either can affect milk drainage, and whenever the milk flow is hindered you are at risk for plugged ducts and mastitis. Always go back to the basics when you are having problems.Are you supporting the breast from underneath? This is not always needed, particularly after the first few weeks. However, if you are having problems with plugged ducts or mastitis, lifting the breast from underneath can increase milk drainage.Are you interrupting feedings or cutting them short (due to outdated advice to limit nursing duration, a busy schedule, taking care of other children or family members, etc.)? This can lead to a backup of milk in the breast and thus increases the risk for engorgement, plugged ducts, or mastitis.Do you press down on the top or side of your breast to make extra breathing space for baby? This should not be necessary (babys nose is designed so baby can breathe while nursing) and can cause plugged ducts and/or sore nipples.Look for anything that results in consistent pressure on the breast tissue  this can block milk flow and lead to plugged ducts. See if you can associate any of the following things with the location of the plug(s): Are you sleeping on one side or on your stomach a lot? Do you carry a heavy purse or bag on one side? Are you carrying the baby in a front carrier or sling? Do you wear an underwire bra that presses in one area? Are you wearing any type of bra that does not fit well? Do you wear a sleep bra that stays pushed up or to the side for much of the time at night? Are you wearing constrictive clothes?Are you having problems with oversupply or engorgement? Do you feel that you have too much milk? Does your baby choke, gag, strangle when nursing because of a fast milk flow? Do you leak a lot? Remedying the oversupply will help to reduce your risk for plugged ducts and mastitis.Do you use a nipple shield? Use of a nipple shield can result in poor milk drainage from the breast.Sometimes moms who pump often (to replace missed nursings) are more prone to plugged ducts because a breastpump simply cannot drain the breast as effectively as the baby. You might try slightly moving the breastshields around to different quadrants of the breast so that these areas will be softened more efficiently.Any kind of exercise that involves repetitive motions of the upper arm may lead to plugged ducts or mastitis.Have your breasts been operated on, scarred, bumped, handled roughly, or otherwise injured? Any breast surgery can cause scarring and/or pressure on milk ducts. Other things that can cause plugged ducts/mastitis are an anatomical problem or variation in a particular duct, breast lumps or cysts, past injuries. In any of these cases, mastitis will recur in the same area of the breast. Recurring mastitis in the same location is one of the warning signs of a breast tumor (but this is rare cause of recurring mastitis).Risk factor: Nipple problemsLook for dried milk secretions on the nipple. If you notice this, apply a warm cloth to the nipple until the dried milk peels off and then try to express some milk. Sometimes this can cause a plugged duct because the duct cannot empty well through the nipple.Have you had any nipple damage? Sore, cracked, or bleeding nipples can offer a point of entry for bacteria. Secondary staph infections may be responsible for delayed healing.Milk blisters can cause repeated plugged ducts.Secondary infections such as thrush (yeast/fungal infection) can cause inflammation within the milk ducts which increases the risk of plugged ducts or mastitis. Moms who are experiencing recurrent plugged ducts or mastitis due to thrush may benefit from taking an anti-inflammatory medication (like ibuprofen) to reduce the inflammation.Risk factor: Mothers overall healthHave you been very tired or busy, worried or stressed? Many times mothers who have recurring bouts of mastitis are not getting enough rest or are trying to do too much. Mastitis is often the bodys way of telling Mom to slow down.Have you been ill? Might you be anemic? Lowered resistance to infection or anemia can cause or contribute to recurrent plugged ducts. A blood test for anemia is a good idea when there is a history of repeated mastitis. Increasing foods containing natural sources of iron (or supplemental vitamins with iron) and a Vitamin C supplement may be helpful.Are bouts associated with hormonal changes (ovulation or menstruation)?Do you have food allergies? According to La Leche Leagues Breastfeeding Answer Book, food allergies occasionally result in plugged ducts that occur either premenstrually or before ovulation:In her book Breastfeeding Matters, Maureen Minchin theorizes that if a mom has allergies, recurring mastitis/plugged ducts might be caused by the complex immune responses that occur when she is exposed to an allergen. In a group of food-intolerant women, Minchin observed that their plugged ducts, which rarely progressed to overt infection and which often recurred either premenstrually or before ovulation, were often accompanied by other symptoms of allergy intolerance.Do you smoke? Smoking can lower your resistance to infections.Risk factor: Mothers dietAre you eating regularly, and eating plenty of fresh food and vegetables? This will help to increase your resistance to infection.Are you drinking to satisfy thirst? Lack of sufficient fluids can contribute to plugged ducts. Make sure you are drinking something each time you sit down to nurse or pump.Too much saturated fat in the diet can be a problem. Reduce animal fats / limit your fat to polyunsaturated fats and take one tablespoon of lecithin (a dietary supplement available at most pharmacies, health foods stores, etc.) Adding lecithin to the diets of moms with recurrent plugged ducts has been shown to be very effective.Either too much salt or too little salt in the diet has been linked to this problem.Risk factor: Babys healthHas your baby been ill? Occasionally, baby can have the bacteria in the back of his throat and be reinfecting mom with mastitis. This can be determined by swabbing the babys throat. If the culture is positive, then baby should be treated along with mom. A culture of your milk can also help your health care provider better determine the best treatment (antibiotic-wise).Treatments for recurrent plugged ducts or mastitisThese treatments should be used in addition to your efforts to find and remedy the source of the problem. Keep in mind that if the source of your recurrent plugged ducts or mastitis is something fixable (for example: oversupply, infrequent nursing, too tight bra, etc.), then solving the underlying problem is the most effective thing you can do.Treatments: Dietary supplements and dietA Vitamin C supplement can be helpful for any mom suffering with recurrent plugged ducts or mastitis.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Many moms have found that taking lecithin (a dietary supplement) can help to resolve and prevent recurrent plugged ducts.Several studies have shown thatprobiotic supplements (certainLactobacillus strains) are effectivein treatinginfectious mastitis and also resulted in a lower occurrence of repeat mastitis.It is also helpful to make sure that youre getting enough liquids, and to reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet.Treatments: Therapeutic breast massageDaily breast massage may help to improve milk drainage and prevent plugged ducts and mastitis. SeeBreastfeeding Medicine of Northeast Ohios video fora demonstration of the basics of therapeutic breast massage.Treatments: Long-term, low-dose antibioticsIf you follow the complete course of treatment with an appropriate antibiotic and the mastitis continues to recur, Dr. Ruth Lawrence (Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession, page 281) suggests long-term, low-dose antibiotics for 2-3 months or even the duration of lactation. This type of treatment has broken the cycle of repeated mastitis for some women. If this treatment is chosen, its also a good idea to have an antifungal medication prescribed along with the antibiotic and/or to supplement the mothers diet with acidophilus to lessen the risk of thrush.Treatments: AcupunctureAcupuncture has also been used successfully for recurrent plugged ducts or mastitis.Treatments: Homeopathic remediesSome moms with recurrent plugged ducts or mastitis have also had good luck withhomeopathic treatment.Treatments: TimeIf you are relatively early postpartum and your recurrent plugs/mastitis seem to be tied to an overabundant milk supply, a little more time may be the best remedy. Hormonal changes occur by about 12 weeks (give or take a bit) that make milk supply more stable and you may notice less of a tendency to get the plugs.References and additional informationMastitis and Plugged Ducts @ Lecithin treatment for recurrent plugged ducts @ Breastfeeding and breast abscess @ LLL FAQ: Repeated Cases of MastitisFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Nausea when breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/nausea-bf/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCA small percentage of moms report nausea during a breastfeeding session in the early weeks of breastfeeding . It goes away for most (but not all) moms by the end of the 6th-8th week. If nausea during breastfeeding begins when baby is older, consider the possibility of pregnancy.Nausea that occurs with the milk let-down may be related to the release of oxytocin. Oxytocin is the hormone that causes the milk ejection reflex (MER or let-down), and it also helps make digestion more efficient and is associated with other gut hormones that can cause nausea. According to Dr. Ruth Lawrence (author of Breastfeeding: A guide for the medical professional), the nausea described has been compared to the nausea of pregnancy that comes in waves. Symptoms are similar to low blood sugar: nausea, headache, hunger, etc.Other symptoms during let-down: Some mothers experience itching (usually of the breast or underarm area) during letdown; this may be due to the increased blood flow or a response to oxytocin release. Hormone-related headaches or feelings of depression (or anxiety, agitation or anger) during let-down can also occur on occasion. Mothers with a history of sexual abuse may experience various symptoms when breastfeeding.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Tips to combat nauseaMost mothers find that getting something to drink and eating complex carbohydrates (like a piece of bread or a cracker) right before and/or during the breastfeeding session seems to calm the nausea.As this is similar to morning sickness, consider trying the various suggestions offered to reduce morning sickness.Snack often to avoid low blood sugar.Try increasing your fluid and/or water intake a bit, even if youre already drinking to thirst. One mother who was already drinking other liquids to thirst found that her nausea went away when she started drinking more water.Wait it out. The nausea should start to improve and will usually disappear after the early weeks of breastfeeding.Nausea that is not associated with let-down may be related to mild dehydration, low blood sugar or exhaustion.Are you taking time to drink enough fluids? Drinking to thirst is recommended for nursing mothers, but mothers busy with a new baby dont always get a chance (or take the time) to drink when theyre thirsty. Keep several bottles of water around the house in places where you typically sit down with baby, so that there is something easily available when youre thirsty.How are you doing with your nutrition in general? Are you taking time to eat? Low blood sugar can occur when you are not eating well and nausea can be a sign of low blood sugar. Besides eating something prior to breastfeeding, take a look at how you are eating in general, and if you have been forgetting to eat you might want to try to improve your diet.Most all new moms are operating on little sleep, and exhaustion is often accompanied with nausea.

Plugged Ducts and Mastitis,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/mastitis/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCHow do I know if I have mastitis or a plugged duct?Common (and not-so-common) side effects of plugged ducts or mastitisWhat are the usual causes of plugged ducts or mastitis?What is the usual treatment for plugged ducts and mastitis?Does mastitis always require antibiotics?References and additional informationHow do I know if I have a plugged duct or mastitis?PLUGGED DUCTA plugged (or blocked) duct is an area of the breast where milk flow is obstructed. The nipple pore may be blocked (see Milk Blister), or the obstruction may be further back in the ductal system. A plugged duct usually comes on gradually and affects only one breast.Local symptomsMom will usually notice a hard lump or wedge-shaped area of engorgement in the vicinity of the plug that may feel tender, hot, swollen or look reddened. Occasionally mom will only notice localized tenderness or pain, without an obvious lump or area of engorgement. The location of the plug may shift.A plugged duct will typically feel more painful before a feeding and less tender afterward, and the plugged area will usually feel less lumpy or smaller after nursing. Nursing on the affected side may be painful, particularly at letdown.Systemic symptomsThere are usually no systemic symptoms for a plugged duct, but a low fever (less than 101.3F / 38.5C) may be present.MASTITISPer Maureen Minchin (Breastfeeding Matters, Chapter 6), mastitis is an inflammation of the breast that can be caused by obstruction, infection and/or allergy. The incidence of postpartum mastitis in Western women is 20%; mastitis is not nearly so common in countries where breastfeeding is the norm and frequent breastfeeding is typical. Mastitis is most common in the first 2-3 weeks, but can occur at any stage of lactation. Mastitis may come on abruptly, and usually affects only one breast.Local symptomsLocal symptoms are the same as for a plugged duct, but the pain/heat/swelling is usually more intense. There may be red streaks extending outward from the affected area.Systemic symptomsTypical mastitis symptoms include a fever of 101.3F (38.5C) or greater, chills, flu-like aching, malaise and systemic illness.Common (and not-so-common) side effects of plugged ducts or mastitisPlugged ductMilk supply and pumping output from the affected breast may decrease temporarily. This is normal and extra nursing/pumping generally get things back to normal within a short time.Occasionally a mom may express strings or grains of thickened milk or fatty-looking milk.After a plugged duct or mastitis has resolved, it is common for the area to remain reddened or have a bruised feeling for a week or so afterwards.MastitisSide effects may be the same as for a plugged duct, plus:Expressed milk may look lumpy, clumpy, gelatin-like or stringy. This milk is fine for baby, but some moms prefer to strain the lumps out.Milk may take on a saltier taste due to increased sodium and chloride content  some babies may resist/refuse the breast due to this temporary change.Milk may occasionally contain mucus, pus or blood.What are the usual causes of plugged ducts or mastitis?Plugged ductMastitisMilk stasis / restricted milk flow may be due to:Engorgement or inadequate milk removal (due to latching problems, ineffective suck, tongue-tie or other anatomical variations, nipple pain, sleepy or distracted baby, oversupply, hurried feedings, limiting babys time at the breast, nipple shield use, twins or higher order multiples, blocked nipple pore, etc.).Infrequent/skipped feedings (due to nipple pain, teething, pacifier overuse, busy mom, return to work, baby suddenly sleeping longer, scheduling, supplementing, abrupt weaning, etc.).Pressure on the duct (from fingers, tight bra or clothing, prone sleeping, diaper bag, etc.).Inflammation (from injury, bacterial/yeast infection, or allergy).Stress, fatigue, anemia, weakened immunityMilk stasis (usually primary cause)Same as for blocked duct.Blocked duct is also a risk factor.InfectionSore, cracked or bleeding nipples can offer a point of entry for infection.Hospital stay increases moms exposure to infectious organisms.Obvious infection on the nipple (crack/fissure with pus, pain) is a risk factor.Past history of mastitis is a risk factor.Stress, fatigue, anemia, weakened immunityWhat is the usual treatment for plugged ducts and mastitis?Its always best to treat a plug immediately and aggressively to avoid escalating into mastitis.CAUTION: Do NOT decrease or stop nursingwhen you have a plugged duct or mastitis,as this increases risk of complications (including abscess).GENERAL SUPPORTIVE MEASURESPlugged DuctNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.RestAdequate fluidsNutritious foods will help to strengthen moms immune systemMastitisBed rest (preferably with baby)Increase fluids, adequate nutritionGet help around the houseBREASTFEEDING MANAGEMENT SAME for plugged duct or mastitis important to start treatment promptlyHeat, Massage, Rest, Empty BreastGeneralNurse frequently & empty the breasts thoroughly.Aim for nursing at least every 2 hrs. Keep the affected breast as empty as possible, but dont neglect the other breast.When unable to breastfeed, mom should express milk frequently and thoroughly (with a breast pump or by hand).Before nursingUse heat & gentle massage before nursing- Warm compress. Try using a disposable diaper: fill the diaper with hot water (try the temperature on your wrist first to avoid burns), squeeze the diaper out a bit, then put the inside of the diaper toward the breast. This will stay warm much longer than a wet cloth.- Basin soak. Fill sink or bowl with hot water and submerge breast in water while massaging the plugged area toward the nipple. Some report better results when epsom salts are added to the water  add a handful of epsom salts per 2 quarts (2 liters) of water. Rinse with fresh water before nursing, as baby may object to the taste.- Hot Shower. It can be helpful to massage in the shower with a large-toothed comb. The comb should be drawn through a bar of soap until it is very soapy and then used to gently massage over the affected area in the direction of the nipple.Loosen bra & any constrictive clothing to aid milk flow.Massage willhelp to improve milk drainage and improve symptoms. SeeBreastfeeding Medicine of Northeast Ohios video fora demonstration of the basics of therapeutic breast massage.While nursingNurse on the affected breast first; if it hurts too much to do this, switch to the affected breast directly after let-down.Ensure good positioning & latch. Use whatever positioning is most comfortable and/or allows the plugged area to be massaged.Note: Advice to point babys chin (or nose) toward the plugged area is not necessarily going to be helpful as it is based on the idea that the milk ducts take a nice, direct route to the nipple  recent research tells us that this is not true, and that a particular duct might begin in one area of the breast but can wander in many different directions before terminating in any area of the nipple.Use breast compressions.Massage gently but firmly from the plugged area toward the nipple.Try nursing while leaning over baby (sometimes called dangle feeding) so that gravity aids in dislodging the plug.After nursingPump or hand express after nursing to aid milk drainage and speed healing.Use cold compresses between feedings for pain & inflammation.See also How do you treat a milk blister?MEDICATION *Plugged ductMastitisAnalgesiaPain reliever/anti-inflammatory(e.g., ibuprofen)Second choice  pain reliever alone(e.g.,acetaminophen)AnalgesiaSame as for plugged ductAntibiotic?NoAntibiotic?No: If symptoms are mild and have been present for less than 24 hours.Yes: If symptoms are not improving in 12-24 hours, or if mom is acutely ill.Most common pathogen is penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Typical antibiotics used for mastitis:- Dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, amoxycillin-clavulinic acid- Cephalexin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, nafcillinMost recommend 10-14 day treatment to prevent relapse. Do not discontinue treatment earlier than prescribed.Consider probiotic to reduce thrush risk.Several studies have shown thatprobiotic supplements (certainLactobacillus strains) are effectivein treatinginfectious mastitis and also resulted in a lower occurrence of repeat mastitis.Some mothers also use natural treatments.* Consult your health care provider for guidance in your specific situation. The medication information is taken from the references listed below and is provided for educational purposes only.Does mastitis always require antibiotics?No, mastitis does not always require antibiotics.Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast that is most commonly caused by milk stasis (obstruction of milk flow) rather than infection. Non-infectious mastitis can usually be resolved without the use of antibiotics. However, per the World Health Organization document Mastitis: Causes and Management, Without effective removal of milk, non-infectious mastitis was likely to progress to infectious mastitis, and infectious mastitis to the formation of an abscess.Per the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicines Clinical Protocol for Mastitis:If symptoms of mastitis are mild and have been present for less than 24 hours, conservative management (effective milk removal and supportive measures) may be sufficient. If symptoms are not improving within 12-24 hours or if the woman is acutely ill, antibiotics should be started.If a mom with mastitis has no obvious risk factors for infection (as noted in the box below), it is likely that the mastitis is non-infectious and, if properly treated, will resolve without antibiotics.When you have mastitisTalk to your DR about startingantibiotics immediately if:Mastitis is in both breasts.Baby is less than 2 weeks old, oryou have recently been in the hospital.You have broken skin on the nipplewith obvious signs of infection.Blood/pus is present in milk.Red streaking is present.Your temperature increases suddenly.Symptoms are sudden and severe.Follow-upRe-evaluate treatment plan if symptoms do not begin to resolve within 2-3 days.Investigate further if mom has more than 2-3 recurrences in the same location.Consider the possibility of thrush if sore nipples begin after antibiotic treatment.As always, consult your own health care provider to determine how this information applies to your specific circumstances.References and additional information@ How do you treat a milk blister?Non-antibiotic treatment of mastitisRecurrent Mastitis or Plugged DuctsLecithin treatment for recurrent plugged ductsBreastfeeding and breast abscess@ other websitesAcademy of Breastfeeding Medicine.

Help — My Baby Won’t Nurse!,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/nb-challenges/back-to-breast/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIntroductionThe BasicsFollow the RulesSuggestions for a typical nursing sessionFeed the Baby!Maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursingCoaxing baby to the breastGeneral TipsInstant Reward techniquesSkin to Skin/Laid Back BreastfeedingWorking with a baby who is actively resisting nursingBottles  yes or no?Nursing StrikesLinks to Additional InformationGeneralNursing StrikesIntroductionThe following techniques have proven helpful for a wide range of problems with baby refusing the breast. Some of the babies who might benefit include:a newborn (or older adopted baby) trying to figure out how to breastfeeda previously-weaned baby whom you wish to breastfeed againa baby who seriously resists nursing (or even being placed in a nursing position)a baby with nipple confusiona baby who is a fussy nurser (but does not completely refuse the breast)a baby on a nursing strikeEven if you have a baby who adamantly resists nursing, getting your baby to breast is very possible but it will probably require time, patience, and kangaroo-style frequency. Expect two steps forward and one step backward.If youre getting discouraged working with your non-nursing baby, read this: My Baby Just Doesnt Get It. If you have a newborn who is not latching on, do keep in mind that almost all reluctant nursers will start latching by four to eight weeks of life.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The BasicsFollow the RulesThe two primary rules when you have a baby who is having problems nursing are:Feed the baby. A baby who is getting the right amount of calories and nutrition is best able to learn how to nurse. First choice for what to feed a non-nursing baby is moms own milk, second choice is banked milk from another mom, third choice is infant formula.Maintain milk supply. If moms milk supply is being maintained with an appropriate frequncy and amount of milk expression, more time is available for baby to learn to nurse, and babys efforts will be better rewarded (with more milk).Suggestions for a typical nursing sessionVery careful, supportive positioning can be very helpful when baby is having problems breastfeeding; for example, a cross-cradle hold or a modified football hold can be useful.If your baby is tolerating it, then work on latching for up to 10 minutes or so. If baby is getting upset, then go with shorter sessions. Its not a good idea to keep trying for more than about 10 minutes  after this baby will be tired, latching will be harder, and there is a risk of baby developing an aversion to the breast if you persist too much.Dont continue trying to get baby to take the breast after major frustration (either moms or babys) sets in; stop for a bit and calm baby (and/or give mom a break) before continuing  let baby suck on a finger, or snuggle baby high up between moms breasts, or hand baby to dad.Sometimes it can be helpful to offer a little supplement at the beginning of a feeding; this can take the edge off babys hunger so he has more patience to work on the breastfeeding. If youve been working on latching and hunger is getting in babys way, go quickly to whatever alternative feeding youre using. If youre both totally frustrated, give a whole feed, but if you think your baby is up for it (and you are too), only offer enough supplement to calm him and go back to working on breastfeeding.If baby does not latch or does not suck effectively (or wont sustain a suck for more than 3 sucks even with breast compressions), then either try supplementing at the breast (see below) or stop and offer baby a little supplement (1/2 ounce or so of expressed milk or formula), and then have another try at nursing. If the second try is unsuccessful, then go ahead and finish up the feed with whatever method of supplementation you are using.Any time that baby does not nurse at all, or nurses but does not soften the breast well, pump after feeding baby. This will help to maintain your milk supply, plus you will have some liquid gold available the next time baby needs a supplement. See Establishing and maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing.Feed the Baby!Do not try to starve your baby into nursing. Your baby is not refusing to nurse just because he doesnt want to and is being stubborn, so ignore anyone who tells you that baby will nurse when he gets hungry enough.In general, a baby who wont nurse, cant nurse. Your goal is to (hopefully) identify why baby cant nurse and either remedy the problem, work around the problem, and/or preserve your milk supply until the problem remedies itself (sometimes necessary for ill, small or premature babies). A board-certified lactation consultant is a great partner to have in this process.Keep baby as full and happy as possible, i.e. continue to offer expressed mothers milk, banked milk, formula or solids (if baby is old enough), but gradually get closer and closer to the nursing position, skin-to-skin, etc. Click here for tips for weaning from formula supplements.Maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursingIt is important to express your milk to maintain milk supply while baby is transitioning to full breastfeeding. See Establishing and maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing for more information.Coaxing baby to the breastGeneral tipsYour goal is to coax baby to the breast. Do not attempt to force your baby to breastfeed. Forcing baby to the breast does not work, stresses baby, and can result in baby forming an aversion to the breast. As baby gets better at nursing and is able to get more milk via nursing, he will grow to trust that breastfeeding works and will have more patience when latching.Wear clothing that allows very easy access to the breasts. Baby may get very impatient in the split-second it takes for mom to lift the blouse and undo the bra. Spend time, if possible, in a warm place that allows both mom and baby to be naked from the waist up.Lots of skin-to-skin contact can help your baby nurse better and even gain weight faster. Keep your baby with you as much as possible, and give him lots of opportunities to nurse (even if youre not successful). Get skin-to-skin with him, first when he is sleepy, right after a bottle feed (or however youre supplementing). This way baby has the opportunity to sleep and wake up happily, skin to skin at moms chest, and mom is right there to catch the earliest hunger cues. If baby moves toward the breast and then falls asleep before even mouthing the nipple, or after sucking twice, then these are positive baby steps, not failures. (Read more about kangaroo care or take a look at the book.)Offer the breast often. Try breastfeeding in babys favorite place, in his favorite position, in the bath, while walking around, while lying down, with baby upright, baby flat on his back, in his sleep, just as he is waking, any time baby looks as if he might be interested, or any other way you can think of, i.e. any time, anywhere.Avoid pressuring baby to nurse. Offer in an ultra-casual way and pretend you dont mind if he refuses (easier said than done, but try not to show any frustration  your aim is to avoid pressuring baby to nurse). Dont hold the back of babys head or push or hold baby to the breast. If baby pulls off the breast, then dont try to make him go back onto the breast at that time  simply try again later. If baby seems frustrated with your offering the breast, then turn the pressure down and simply make the breast available (lots of skin-to-skin!) without offering. It can be helpful to have lots of skin-to-skin time with baby where he is cuddled at the breast with no pressure to nurse  give control over to your baby, so that baby decides if and when to nurse and when to stop nursing.Carry your baby close to you (a sling or other baby carrier can help with this). Wear, carry, hold and cuddle your baby as much as possible; carry baby on your hip while doing other things, play with baby, and give baby lots of focused attention.Sleep near your baby. If baby sleeps with you, youll get more skin-to-skin contact, plus baby has more access to the breast (see this information on safe co-sleeping). If baby is not in the same bed, have babys bed beside your bed or in the same room so that you can catch early feeding cues, breastfeed easier at night, and get more sleep.Nipple shields can be helpful at times for transitioning baby to the breast. Talk to your lactation consultant about using this tool.Comfort nursing is often the first to come, followed by nutritive nursing. Offer the breast for comfort any time you see a chance- at the end of a feeding when baby is not hungry, when baby is going to sleep or just waking up, when baby is asleep, and whenever he needs to comfort suck If your baby is actively resisting nursing, then try encouraging comfort nursing after baby is comfortable with skin-to-skin contact. After baby is willing to nurse for comfort, you can then proceed to working on nursing for meals as well.You are working to seduce your baby back to breast. Again, coax, dont force!Instant Reward techniquesFor a newborn who is not latching or an older baby who does not want to wait for letdown, try these techniques that help to teach (or re-teach) your baby that nursing is a way to get milk:Hand express or pump until let-down, just before trying to latch baby, so that baby gets an instant reward for latching on. Another way to elicit let-down is by doing reverse pressure softening.If you are using a nipple shield to transition to nursing, try filling the tip of the shield with expressed milk prior to applying the shield and latching, so that baby gets some milk first thing as he latches.Drip expressed breastmilk (if you have it) or formula onto the tip of the nipple as youre latching (use an eyedropper or a bottle). You can continue this while youre breastfeeding: Just drip milk toward the center of babys upper lip; let the drop start on the breast and roll down toward the center of the upper lip (12 oclock position if youre using the football/clutch hold), one drop at a time. A curved tip syringe can also be used to drip milk into babys mouth.Use a nursing supplementer to increase milk flow at the breast.If baby starts breastfeeding but stops sucking as soon as the milk flow slows, breast compressions can speed the flow of milk. If this is not sufficient, the last two methods above can also be used.Skin to Skin/Laid-Back BreastfeedingKeeping baby skin to skin with mom and laid-back breastfeeding techniques can both be very helpful when encouraging baby to breastfeed. This video shows baby-led, mother-guided latching. One technique used to get babies to accept the breast has been called rebirthing, but this is essentially just laid-back breastfeeding in the bath. Mom gets into the bathtub, full of warm (not hot) water with baby. Place baby on moms tummy, in the water. Stroke baby, talk to baby. This may take time, but baby may begin to work his way up to the breast, search it out, and begin to suckle. Its important to have a support person with mom when doing this, for the safety of the baby.Working with a baby who is actively resisting nursingMake sure that a physical problem is not causing baby to resist nursing. Could baby have a birth injury or other condition that makes positioning for nursing painful? Is baby having problems with breathing while nursing or coordinating sucking and swallowing? Does baby have an overactive gag reflex that makes nursing uncomfortable? Does baby have severe reflux that makes feeding painful? Does baby have a sore throat from suctioning or other medical interventions? These are just some of the things that might interfere with breastfeeding.Sometimes a baby will aggressively refuse the breast for no discernable reason  this baby will often resist being held, and may also be easily overstimulated. These babies can be transitioned to breastfeeding, but it should be done very gently so that baby becomes comfortable with being at the breast.La Leche Leagues Breastfeeding Answer Book lists the stages that these babies go through as they transition to breastfeeding:The baby aggressively fights the breast.The baby cries more while being held than when hes put down.The baby is willing to be held in some positions, even if not in a cradle hold.The baby tolerates being held in the cradle hold. The baby will attempt to root.The baby will lick at the milk on the nipple.The baby will attempt to suck, using and in-and-out movement.The baby will take milk at the breast.The baby nurses well, even before the let-down occurs.Source: Mohrbacher N, Stock J. The Breastfeeding Answer Book, Third Revised Edition. Schaumburg, Illinois: La Leche League International, 2003, p. 136-137.Some babies will become more resistant the more you press the issue of nursing. If youve been working hard to get baby to latch and baby is resisting nursing, it can be helpful to step back for a bit, take the pressure off both yourself and baby, and not try to latch baby at all for a few days. Then slowly and gently work on moving baby through the above stages.Start out by bottle feeding (or using whatever form of alternative feeding you prefer) in the feeding position you usually use, without trying to nurse. If baby resists being held in the beginning, it might be helpful to feed baby in an infant carrier or perhaps while holding baby so he is facing away from you.Work with baby until he becomes comfortable being held in any position, then being held in a nursing position.Once baby is comfortable being held in a nursing position, start trying more skin-to-skin contact. Dont actively try to get baby to latch before he is comfortable with skin-to-skin. You want baby to be able to trust being at the breast and cuddling at the breast without the stress of trying to latch.When baby is comfortable cuddling at the breast, try feeding (bottle, etc.) at the breast. Youre working to get him comfortable with feeding in a breastfeeding position, skin-to-skin.Next step, start offering the breast for comfort when hes really relaxed and sleepy, or even asleep. Nursing in the side lying position might be helpful, as this positioning allows for less body contact. Some babies will take the breast after bottle-feeding or partway through a bottle-feeding.Once baby is willing to take the breast for comfort, begin to work toward full breastfeeding.Bottles  yes or no?Many experts suggest that baby not get bottles or pacifiers while he is learning to nurse correctly, with the idea that his need to suck will help the process along (nursing will satisfy the need to suck). Of course, if youre working with a baby who has nipple confusion, its best to avoid bottles (when mom and baby are together, in particular) until nursing is going well again. If baby is not latching on at all, you do need to balance this with your babys need to suck and comfort level.Do consider giving your baby his feedings via an alternative feeding device other than a bottle, such as a nursing supplementer, feeding syringe, finger feeding setup, flexible cup, spoon, medicine/eye dropper, etc. A nursing supplementer can be a big help if baby is latching well: it will encourage your baby to continue nursing by giving him a constant flow of milk (expressed milk or formula) while he stimulates your body to produce more milk.If you prefer to use a bottle for supplementing baby, its not the end of the world (or your breastfeeding relationship). For some moms, using a bottle is easier and more familiar. If you feel that using a specialized feeding device (like a finger feeder or SNS) is simply too overwhelming and other methods (cup, dropper) are not working for you, using bottles may make it easier for you to continue working on the breastfeeding. Although bottles can certainly have their disadvantages, a good lactation consultant should be able to help you to transition to breastfeeding with or without the bottles.When using a bottle, encourage baby to open wide prior to giving the bottle. Stroke babys lips from nose to chin with the bottle nipple, and wait until baby opens wide like a yawn. Allow your baby to accept the bottle into his mouth rather than poking it in. This will teach your baby to open wide for feedings, which is a good start to getting on the breast effectively.Nursing StrikesWhen babies abruptly stop nursing, its a nursing strike  not weaning. Babies rarely wean on their own before 18-24 months, and self-weaning is almost never abrupt.Will baby nurse while asleep or just waking up? This is usually one of the best times to try. You also might try nursing lying down or while walking around. See also the tips at the top of this page for persuading baby to nurse.As long as baby is not nursing as often as before, youll want to express milk to maintain your supply, stay comfortable, and reduce the risk of plugged ducts and mastitis.Dont miss the great links below about nursing strikes.Additional informationGeneralMy Baby Just Doesnt Get It by Diane Wiessinger, IBCLCInfant Self-Attachment by Teresa PitmanBreast Compression by Jack Newman, MDWhen Baby Does Not Yet Latchby Jack Newman, MDHelping a Mother with a Baby Who Is Reluctant to Nurse by Karen Zeretzke, MED, IBCLC, RLCWhen a Baby Wont Nurse by Carol Brussel, BA, IBCLCOral Aversion in the Breastfed Neonate by Linda Killion Healow, BSN, IBCLC and Rebecca Sliter Hugh, IBCLCTactile Defensiveness and Other Sensory Modulation Difficulties by Catherine Watson Genna, BS, IBCLC, from Leaven, Vol. 37 No. 3, June-July 2001, pp. 51-53.Mohrbacher N, Stock J.

How breastfeeding makes life easier for mom,http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/bf-life/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCGoing OutNeed an extra hand?Save TimeRest & RelaxSoothe illnessGet your body backIncrease self esteemSpace babiesSave MoneyOther perksEnjoy peace of mindAdditional informationGoing OutBreastfed babies are incredibly portable, particularly in the first six months or so before they become mobile and before they are eating solids.Breastfeeding moms can travel light. It will take less time to pack the diaper bag  all you need is a diaper & wipes, and perhaps a change of clothes for baby. I keep a couple of diapers, wipes and a change of clothes for baby in a backpack or hip pack (which doubles as my purse), but I dont even take these with me if Im going on a short shopping trip. I leave the bag in the car, put money and keys in my pocket and baby in the sling, and were off. For longer trips well take the bag and sometimes a stroller.You can go places on the spur of the moment, or stay out longer than you planned without worrying about what baby will eat.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.No need to find a place to heat a bottle or a safe water source.You will also cancel fewer social events and miss less work due to a sick baby.Nervous about nursing in public? Read more here about Breastfeeding in Public.Need an extra hand?With breastfeeding, you have an extra hand free (if you use a sling, you might have both hands free). With a little practice (once breastfeeding is going well), mom can breastfeed and eat at the same time, breastfeed and talk on the phone at the same time, etc. You can also breastfeed while you shop, care for other children or read.Save TimeBreastfeeding allows you to feed or calm your baby immediately, which leads to a happier baby who cries less.With breastfeeding, there is nothing to prepare, buy or clean. No shopping for formula, measuring, mixing, warming or sterilizing. No time washing bottles and other feeding equipment.If you work and pump or exclusively pump, you lose some of the timesaving benefits, but pumping moms have found that it is worth the extra time to provide baby with breastmilk.Rest & RelaxNursing hormones help mom to feel relaxed and peaceful. Nursing your child can be a relaxing break, and can help a postpartum mom get enough rest. The calming hormones can also be really helpful when dealing with your older children!Once mom and baby get the hang of it, mom can nurse and sleep at the same time. Being able to nurse immediately means that its easier to nurse baby as soon as he cues hunger and before baby gets upset  this way, mom and baby can both go back to sleep faster.Soothe illnessNursing provides both superior nutrition, hydration and comfort when your baby is sick. Many times, nursing is the only way a sick child will be willing to eat or drink  breastfeeding children are much less likely to be hospitalized for dehydration. Nursing is extremely comforting to an ill baby and a major part of the healing process.Get your body backBreastfeeding helps the uterus return to its regular size more quickly, so mom can get her tummy back into shape quicker.Breastfeeding uses extra calories. Many moms have an easier time losing weight even without restricting calories. Research shows that exclusively breastfeeding mothers tend to have a greater loss of weight, body fat percentage, and hip and upper thigh circumference.Dont forget the many health benefits that mom gets by breastfeeding.Increase self esteemBreastfeeding builds moms self-esteem.Space babiesBreastfeeding moms often go many months without a period. Exclusive breastfeeding delays fertility and helps with child spacing.Save MoneyYou can breastfeed without buying anything extra whatsoever: no formula costs; save money on birth control and menstrual supplies; save money on doctor bills, medications and future orthodontist bills; fewer missed work days.No waste is involved in breastfeeding. You dont have to throw out milk that baby doesnt drink in a sitting. Even if you pump, the antibacterial qualities of breastmilk allow you to keep milk that baby doesnt drink for the next feeding. In addition, no packaging materials are generated by breastfeeding.More here on the cost benefits of breastfeeding.Other perksBabys diapers smell better. Spit up doesnt stain or smell bad. Breastfed babies tend to be less gassy, spit up less, dont get constipated, and have fewer diaper rashes.The frequency and closeness of nursing and attention to babys cues helps mom to bond with baby and learn babys cues more quickly.Enjoy peace of mindMom can be certain that baby is getting the absolute best in nutrition and immunities.If your electricity or water goes out, no need to worry about babys food. Snowed in? No need to worry about getting to the store to buy formula. During natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, breastmilk is available and safe.Additional informationCost benefits of breastfeeding @ Breastfeeding, Natural and Cheap: Frugal Advantages to Breast Feeding from Frugal Living at About.comTestament to Breastfeeding by Patricia Lynn JanesThe Easy Way by Wendy Merron Goldenthal, Certified Breastfeeding CounselorYes, Busy Moms Can Keep Breastfeeding (WIC brochure)A Well-Kept Secret: Breastfeedings Benefits to Mothers by Alicia Dermer, MD, IBCLCLinks: Dads and Breastfeeding @  has information on how breastfeeding can benefit Dad and other family membersFacebookPinterestTwitter"

The contribution of breast milk to toddler diets in western Kenya. Bull World Health Organ, 2002, vol.80 no.4. ISSN 0042-9686. The nutritional role of mothers milk in the second year is inversely related to the adequacy of the complementary diet. In this study, breast milk was an irreplaceable source of fat and vitamin A. When the weaning diet is inadequate for key nutrients because of low intake or poor bioavailability, breast milk assumes greater nutritional significance in the second year of life but does not guarantee adequate nutrient intakes.Buckley KM.

February 2001;48(1).Fawzi WW, et al. A longitudinal study of prolonged breastfeeding in relation to child undernutrition. Int J Epidemiol. 1998 Apr;27(2):255-60. In conclusion, there is no evidence that prolonged breastfeeding per se is associated with poorer nutritional status. Rather we found a higher risk of malnutrition among breastfed infants from poorer households and whose parents are illiterate and are thus less likely to have adequate complementary feeding.Persson V, Greiner T, Islam S, and Gebre-Medhin M.

Our findings suggest that either prolonged breast-feeding may offer substantial protection against clinical malnutrition in the study population or malnutrition leads mothers to stop breast-feeding. These results are inconsistent with those of a number of workers who have reported that prolonged breast-feeding is associated with an increased risk of malnutrition. This inconsistency might have arisen because of differences in the definition of malnutrition used or because of variations in the quantity and quality of weaning foods available in different settings. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that prolonged breast-feeding may be detrimental to children.Grummer-Strawn LM. Does prolonged breast-feeding impair child growth? A critical review.

There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer.Dettwyler KA.

Breastfeeding Past Infancy: 9 Myths,http://kellymom.com/ages/after12mo/ebf-myths/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage courtesy of Dave / flickr.comMYTH #1Breastfeeding a child older than a year is no different than breastfeeding a young infant.FACT: Nursing frequency and duration vary widely from child to child after the first year. As time passes, and as the nutritional aspects of breastfeeding become less significant, the comfort aspect of breastfeeding becomes much more significant. Children also incorporate breastfeeding into their play, which can add a new dimension to the breastfeeding relationship.MYTH #2 A breastfeeding child older than a year is not getting any food or drinks other than breastmilk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.FACT:Depending upon their age, these children are eating and drinking the same things that other family members eat and drink, with the milk they get from mom as an added nutritional and immunological cushion. Someyounger toddlers (12-18 months) may still be getting mostly breastmilk, but this will gradually change as they get older and eat more family foods. Some people also mistakenly assume that breastfed children wont know how to drink from a cup; in fact, breastfed childrenare introduced to cups (and spoons, forks and other tableware)just like any other child.MYTH #3Mothers milk becomes less nutritious after the first year.FACT: Mothers milk continues to provide substantial amounts of nutrients well beyond the first year. At some point after 6 months your childwill need additional nutrients from other sources, but mothers milk remains a valuable contribution to your childs diet, including important nutrients designed especially for brain growth.MYTH #4The immunities in mothers milk are insignificant after the first few months.FACT: The immunities in mothers milk continue as long as nursing continues, and some of the immunities increase in concentration as your childmoves toward weaning. Children who are breastfed have fewer illnesses and illnesses of shorter duration than their non-nursing peers. The American Academy of Family Physicians notes that children weaned before two years of age are at increased risk of illness.MYTH #5Breastfeeding past a year (or any other arbitrary age) makes a child overly dependent and can cause psychological harm.FACT: On the contrary, meeting a childs need for breastfeeding fosters independence on the childs own developmental timetable. Both research and the experiences of mothers worldwide indicate that children who nurse past a year have excellent social adjustment. Per the American Academy of Pediatrics, There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer. The American Academy of Family Physicians notes that the natural age of weaning in humans has been estimated to be between 2 and 7 years, and adds There is no evidence that extended breastfeeding is harmful to mother or child.MYTH #6Mothers who breastfeed past infancy have not learned other ways of comforting their child.FACT: For the typical mother, breastfeeding is only one of many tools in her parenting toolkit.MYTH #7Mothers only continue breastfeeding past infancy for their own benefit.FACT: A child will not breastfeed if he does not have a need to do so. A mother typically continues breastfeeding because her child is not ready to wean, and because of the continuing health and emotional benefits to her child.MYTH #8Breastfeeding mothers need to wean for fertility to return. Breastfeeding during pregnancy is not safe.FACT: Most mothers can get pregnant while continuing breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is considered compatible with a healthy pregnancy.MYTH #9The longer you breastfeed, the harder it will be to wean.FACT: Age has much less to do with ease of weaning than does your childs developmental readiness for weaning. Each child has his own developmental timeline for child-led weaning. If mom initiates weaning, then the closer the child is to weaning on his own, the easier it will be (for both mom and child) to accelerate this natural progression. If the child takes the lead in weaning, then this is not an issue at all.For more information, see Breastfeeding After the First YearFacebookPinterestTwitter"

Breastfeeding Past Infancy: Fact Sheet,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/ebf-benefits/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCPDF version (great for printing) | BulgarianBreastfeeding benefits toddlers and young childrennutritionally, immunologically and psychologically.Breastfeeding contributes to your childs NUTRITIONBreastfeeding contributes to your childs HEALTHBreastfeeding contributes to your childs INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTBreastfeeding contributes to your childs SOCIAL and MENTAL DEVELOPMENTBreastfeeding your child past infancy is NORMALMOTHERS also benefit from breastfeeding for a longer durationAdditional ResourcesBreastfeeding contributes to your childs NUTRITIONAlthough there has been little research done on children who breastfeed beyond the age of two, the available information indicates that breastfeeding continues to be a valuable source of nutrition and disease protection for as long as breastfeeding continues.Human milk in the second year postpartum contained significantly higher concentrations of total protein, lactoferrin, lysozyme and Immunoglobulin A, than milk bank samples, and significantly lower concentrations of zinc, calcium, iron and oligosaccharides. Perrin 2016Human milk expressed by mothers who have been lactating for >1 year has significantly increased fat and energy contents, compared with milk expressed by women who have been lactating for shorter periods. During prolonged lactation, the fat energy contribution of breast milk to the infant diet might be significant. Mandel 2005In a study of 250 toddlers in western Kenya, breastmilk provided, on average, 32% of the childs total energy intake. Breast milk made an important contribution to the fat and vitamin A intakes of toddlers in this community. Onyango 2002Breast milk continues to provide substantial amounts of key nutrients well beyond the first year of life, especially protein, fat, and most vitamins. Dewey 2001In the second year (12-23 months), 448 mL of breastmilk provides:29% of energy requirements43% of protein requirements36% of calcium requirements75% of vitamin A requirements76% of folate requirements94% of vitamin B12 requirements60% of vitamin C requirements Dewey 2001Studies done in rural Bangladesh have shown that breastmilk continues to be an important source of vitamin A in the second and third year of life. Persson 1998Its not uncommon for weaning to be recommended for toddlers who are eating few solids. However, this recommendation is not supported by research. Research does indicate that in situations where breastfed toddlers have an increased risk of malnutrition, this appears to be due to inadequate complementary feeding or reverse causality (the mother is more likely to continue breastfeeding a child who is ill or growing poorly). In one study of 250 toddlers in Kenya, solid food intake increased after weaning, but not enough to replace all the fat, vitamin A, and niacin that the child had been getting via breastfeeding (Onyango 2002). According to Sally Kneidel in Nursing Beyond One Year (New Beginnings, Vol. 6 No. 4, July-August 1990, pp. 99-103.): Some doctors may feel that nursing will interfere with a childs appetite for other foods. Yet there has been no documentation that nursing children are more likely than weaned children to refuse supplementary foods. In fact, most researchers in Third World countries, where a malnourished toddlers appetite may be of critical importance, recommend continued nursing for even the severely malnourished (Briend et al, 1988; Rhode, 1988; Shattock and Stephens, 1975; Whitehead, 1985). Most suggest helping the malnourished older nursing child not by weaning but by supplementing the mothers diet to improve the nutritional quality of her milk (Ahn and MacLean. 1980; Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1978) and by offering the child more varied and more palatable foods to improve his or her appetite (Rohde, 1988; Tangermann, 1988; Underwood, 1985).ReferencesBreastfeeding contributes to your childs HEALTHThe American Academy of Family Physicians notes that children weaned before two years of age are at increased risk of illness (AAFP 2008).Breastfeeding toddlers between the ages of one and three have been found to have fewer illnesses, illnesses of shorter duration, and lower mortality rates (Mlbak 1994, van den Bogaard 1991, Gulick 1986).Antibodies are abundant in human milk throughout lactation (Nutrition During Lactation 1991; p. 134). In fact, some of the immune factors in breastmilk increase in concentration during the second year and also during the weaning process. (Lawrence & Lawrence 2011, Goldman 1983, Goldman & Goldblum 1983, Institute of Medicine 1991)Human milk in the second year postpartum contained significantly higher concentrations of lactoferrin, lysozyme and Immunoglobulin A, than milk bank samplescollected from donors less than 12 months postpartum. (Perrin 2016)Per the World Health Organization, a modest increase in breastfeeding rates could prevent up to 10% of all deaths of children under five: Breastfeeding plays an essential and sometimes underestimated role in the treatment and prevention of childhood illness. [emphasis added]ReferencesBreastfeeding contributes to your childs INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTExtensive research on the relationship between cognitive achievement (IQ scores, grades in school) and breastfeeding has shown the greatest gains for those children breastfed the longest.ReferencesNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Breastfeeding contributes to your childs MENTAL and SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTA couple of studies have shown a positive relationship between longer breastfeeding duration and social development. Duazo 2010, Baumgartner 1984A shorter duration of breastfeeding may be a predictor of adverse mental health outcomes throughout the developmental trajectory of childhood and early adolescence. Oddy 2010According to Elizabeth N. Baldwin, Esq. in Extended Breastfeeding and the Law:Breastfeeding is a warm and loving way to meet the needs of toddlers and young children. It not only perks them up and energizes them; it also soothes the frustrations, bumps and bruises, and daily stresses of early childhood. In addition, nursing past infancy helps little ones make a gradual transition to childhood.Baldwin continues: Meeting a childs dependency needs is the key to helping that child achieve independence. And children outgrow these needs according to their own unique timetable. Children who achieve independence at their own pace are more secure in that independence then children forced into independence prematurely.ReferencesBreastfeeding your child past infancy is NORMALThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that Breastfeeding should be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child Increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and the mother There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer. (AAP 2012, AAP 2005)The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that breastfeeding continue throughout the first year of life and that As recommended by the WHO, breastfeeding should ideally continue beyond infancy, but this is not the cultural norm in the United States and requires ongoing support and encouragement. It has been estimated that a natural weaning age for humans is between two and seven years. Family physicians should be knowledgeable regarding the ongoing benefits to the child of extended breastfeeding, including continued immune protection, better social adjustment, and having a sustainable food source in times of emergency. The longer women breastfeed, the greater the decrease in their risk of breast cancer. They also note that If the child is younger than two years of age, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned. (AAFP 2008)The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine affirms breastfeeding beyond infancy as the biological norm. The average age at weaning ranges anywhere from six months to five years Claims that breastfeeding beyond infancy is harmful to mother or infant have absolutely no medical or scientific basis, says Arthur Eidelman, MD, president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine. Indeed, the more salient issue is the damage caused by modern practices of premature weaning. The global organization of physicians further notes that Human milk contains nutrients, antibodies, and immune-modulating substances that are not present in infant formula or cows milk. Longer breastfeeding duration is further associated with reduced maternal risks of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and heart attack. (ABM 2012)A US Surgeon General has stated that it is a lucky baby who continues to nurse until age two. (Novello 1990)The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of nursing up to two years of age or beyond (WHO 1993, WHO 2002).Scientific research by Katherine A. Dettwyler, PhD shows that 2.5 to 7.0 years of nursing is what our children have been designed to expect (Dettwyler 1995).References [see also position statements supporting breastfeeding]MOTHERS also benefit from breastfeeding for a longer durationExtended nursing delays the return of fertility in some women by suppressing ovulation (References).Breastfeeding reduces the risk of breast cancer (References). Studies have found a significant inverse association between duration of lactation and breast cancer risk.Breastfeeding also reduces the risk of ovarian cancer (References), uterine cancer (References), and endometrial cancer (References).Breastfeeding protects against osteoporosis. During lactation a mother may experience decreases of bone mineral. A nursing moms bone mineral density may be reduced in the whole body by 1 to 2 percent while she is still nursing. This is gained back, and bone mineral density may actually increase, when the baby is weaned from the breast. This is not dependent on additional calcium supplementation in the mothers diet. (References).Breastfeeding reduces the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (References).Breastfeeding reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (References).Breastfeeding has been shown to decrease insulin requirements in diabetic women. There is also a decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in mothers who do not have a history of gestational diabetes (References).Breastfeeding moms may lose weight easier (References).Additional ResourcesExtended Breastfeeding Links @ Extended Breastfeeding References @ FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Criticism from strangers happens occasionally, but tends to be easier to deal with since youre unlikely to see those people again. Criticism from family members and others close to you can be much harder to handle.Sometimes the people close to you  particularly your parents  feel that when you make parenting choices that are different from their own, it is a personal attack on their own parenting choices. They may truly feel that accepting your parenting choices is the same thing as admitting that their own parenting choices were wrong. It may be helpful to make it clear that your choices are not a judgment on their parenting, but a result of having different information available that you are using to make choices for your own unique child and family.Always keep in mind that family members and close friends who make negative comments about breastfeeding generally do so because they care for you and your child, even if their comments are uninformed or inappropriate.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Although this information is aimed at responding to criticism about breastfeeding, it can be applied to other parenting decisions as well.Techniques for responding to criticismEducateMany people simply arent aware that there are continuing benefits of breastfeeding for you and your child. They do not know that there is a huge amount of research data that supports sustained breastfeeding particularly regarding the health benefits. State the scientific facts about why breastfeeding is beneficial. Print off some written material and leave it around your house the bathroom is always a good place! Gently ask the person who is criticizing you to read through itnot for the sake of argument, but for the sake of considering what is beneficial for your child.Here are links to general facts and information on the benefits of nursing past the age of 12 months.Respond to specific concernsTry to find out exactly why they feel nursing is a problem  this way you can respond to specific concerns and correct any misinformation. Do they think that there are no benefits to baby? Are they worried what others will think? Have they read the research? Have they met other families with children who were breastfed for an extended time?Let them know how their comments make you feelIt may be helpful to have a heart-to-heart talk with someone who has too many negative things to say about breastfeeding. This unsupportive person may need to hear you say how these comments hurt you and your child (particularly if your child is older), and that you need them to stop. Children often understand a lot more than you realize, and negative comments and actions can be confusing and upsetting to them. Your words may get through, or at least prevent this person from criticizing breastfeeding in your or your childs presence.Quote an authoritySome people who will not listen to you will listen to a doctor or other professional. Say that your childs doctor recommends continued nursing. If your doctor is firmly pro-breastfeeding, take the unsupportive person with you to a doctor appointment so they can hear it for themselves. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. The World Health Organization recommends that babies be breastfed for at least two years.Here are links to statements from authorities on the importance of breastfeeding.Laugh it offSome have found humor to be an effective way to hush others. You might come back with something like, Dont worry. I dont think Ill have to room with her when she moves into the dorm at college!Avoid the issueAnother way to handle criticism is to do your best to avoid the issue. If the subject of breastfeeding comes up, politely change the subject. Try to go into a different room to nurse to avoid or minimize any direct comments to your child.Make the subject completely off-boundsSome parents (particularly when others are very opposed to continued breastfeeding) find it most effective to refuse to argue or discuss the matter at all. Its sometimes necessary to be nice but firm: This is my child and my parenting choice and I will not discuss it anymore. If they DO bring the subject up, answer with the exact same phrase every time (for example, This is what works for our family) until they realize that the matter is not up for discussion. If that doesnt work, then leave.What if nothing is working?When you are willing to debate the matter, some people will feel that they have a good chance of convincing you that you are wrongand thus will continue with their objections ad infinitum. Sometimes a person is not really interested in hearing your reasons, but only wants to keep wearing you down until you do things their way. If its just an emotional response that they are having, and they cant give any reason for it (or keep giving bad reasons one after another as soon as you answer, without any intention of stopping or listening to you), then you might be better off with doing things like using humor, avoiding the issue or making the subject off-bounds.Express confidence in your decision while being as diplomatic as possible (depending upon who youre talking to). Once they realize that there is no chance of dissuading you, then they may give up the argument, or at least tone it down. Repeat the same statement every time the issue comes up. Eventually it will get through.In some cultures it is considered a childs birthright to be nursed until the age of two. It is believed all your sins are forgiven when you nurse your baby, and an angel stands behind you and pats you on the back when you are done. I like to think of an angel standing behind me every time I nurse. It is a very comforting thought when things arent going well. If you cant get support from your family, at least the angels are behind you.    DianeResponses to criticism that other parents have usedThats interesting. What makes you think that?Im parenting the way that feels right to me.I respect your opinion and value your advice, but I have thought this out carefully and done a lot of research, and my mind is made up. I will be happy to respect your opinion and listen to what you have to say, but you have to respect my decisionand it is MY decision.As the parent of this baby, and because of all Ive learned about the importance of breastfeeding, in my heart of hearts this is what I want  and need  to do for my child right now. If you love us both, you need to support me in this decision.You know how the medical community is always changing their recommendations. Well, this is what they recommend nowthis is the best I have to go on, and I feel good about breastfeeding.Were working on weaning now. [Once solids are introduced, youre technically in the process of weaningthough it may take a few years.]This is what works for our family. Unless it becomes a problem, were not going to change things. [Case closed- -save the arguments for someone who is truly interested in listening to them.]Why would I want to replace nursing with something that costs money and is nutritionally and immunologically inferior? [This one is not exactly tactful, so consider who youre talking to before you use it.]Responses to your parents:Now that Ive become a parent, I have a new appreciation for what you went through for me, and Im so thankful to be able to come to you for advice. It especially helps to know that youre going to support me in my decision to breastfeed, because that means so much to me.Its not that I resent you for not breastfeeding me  I dont. You made the decision that was right for you and your baby (me). I am making the decision that is right for us.The sandwich technique sometimes works:Say something complimentary first: Im so glad you are here to be with my children; Having a loving grandma like you is so important; You are such a wonderful grandma, just like I knew you would be.Then make the point you are trying to make: It really upsets me when you criticize my choice and my pediatricians recommendation to breastfeed to the degree that I feel I might start to avoid visiting with you.Then say something nice again: That would make me sad because I know you love the children and I want them to have you in their life because you are so special.Further information@Extended breastfeeding fact sheetBreastfeeding Past Infancy: 9 MythsWhat do health authorities say about breastfeeding past the first year?The Many Benefits of Breastfeeding@ other websites Handling Unwanted Advice by Elizabeth PantleyResponding to Criticism by Marianne Vakiener.

Does My Baby Need Vitamins?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/vitamins/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCOverviewVitamin AVitamin B-1 (thiamine)Vitamin B-2 (riboflavin)Vitamin B-6Vitamin B-12Vitamin CCalciumVitamin DVitamin EFluorideFolic acid (folate)IronVitamin KNiacinZincReferencesOverviewVitamin and mineral supplements are not generally necessary for the average healthy, full-term breastfed baby during the first year. Studies have shown that most vitamins, fluoride, iron, water, juice, formula and solid foods are not beneficial to healthy breastfed babies during the first six months, and some can even be harmful. There are certain cases where a vitamin supplement may be needed for a breastfed baby during the first year (see below for specifics).The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend that all babies receive a vitamin K injection soon after birth to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, and routine vitamin D supplementation due to decreased sunlight exposure and an increase in rickets.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Some very premature babies (weighing less than 1500 grams/3.3 pounds) may need extra vitamins and minerals, which can be added to their mothers milk before being given to the baby.Following is more specific information on babys needs for certain vitamins and minerals.[top]Vitamin ABreastmilk is a natural, excellent source of vitamin A. Promoting breastfeeding is the best way to protect babies from Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is rare in breastfed babies even in areas of the world where vitamin A deficiency is widespread. Breastmilk: A Critical Source of Vitamin A for Infants and Young Children (PDF format) from the LINKAGES Project. Also available in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.[top]Vitamin B1 (thiamine) If mom is getting enough thiamine, then her milk has enough for baby and supplements are not needed. If mom is thiamine-deficient, then adding additional thiamine to moms diet should increase the amount of thiamine in her milk (since this vitamin is water-soluble) to the necessary levels. Thiamine deficiency (beriberi) is rare in the United States.[top]Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) Supplements are not recommended for breastfed babies, as riboflavin deficiency is rare in developed countries. The levels of riboflavin in human milk are quite constant and are usually affected only by large maternal supplements (3x the maternal RDA).[top]Vitamin B6If mom gets adequate amounts of vitamin B6, then additional supplements are not necessary for a healthy baby. If mom is not getting enough vitamin B6, then adding additional vitamin B6 to moms diet will increase the levels in her milk to the required levels.[top]Vitamin B12See Does my baby need vitamin B12 supplements?[top]Vitamin CBreastfed babies should not be routinely supplemented with vitamin C except in cases of obvious scurvy (vitamin C deficiency). FDA requirements for breastfeeding mothers for this vitamin are 120 mg per day (over 18 years) and 115 mg per day (under 18 years). If you smoke, add 35 mg per day to these amounts. Supplements of vitamin C for a mother do not significantly alter the amounts in breastmilk, as they remain fairly constant no matter what mothers intake levels (assuming the mother is not vitamin-C deficient). For a mother deficient in vitamin C, supplements will increase milk levels.[top]CalciumBreastfed babies do not need additional calcium over that which they get from breastmilk and (during the second 6 months) complementary foods. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on Calcium Requirements of Infants, Children, and Adolescents:No available evidence shows that exceeding the amount of calcium retained by the exclusively breastfed term infant during the first 6 months of life or the amount retained by the human milk-fed infant supplemented with solid foods during the second 6 months of life is beneficial to achieving long-term increases in bone mineralization.[top]Vitamin DThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all babies receive routine vitamin D supplementation (400 IU per day) due to decreased sunlight exposure and an increase in rickets.The babies who do need these supplements need them due to a lack of sufficient sunlight. Factors that put your breastfed baby at risk for vitamin D deficiency (rickets) are:Baby has very little exposure to sunlight. For example: if you live in a far northern latitude, if you live in an urban area where tall buildings and pollution block sunlight, if baby is always completely covered and kept out of the sun, if baby is always inside during the day, or if you always apply high-SPF sunscreen.Both mother and baby have darker skin and thus require more sun exposure to generate an adequate amount of vitamin D. Again, this is a not enough sunlight issue  the darker your skin pigmentation, the greater the amount of sun exposure needed. There is not much information available on howmuchmore sunlight is needed if you have medium or darker toned skin.Mother is deficient in vitamin D  there is increasing evidence in the last few years indicating that vitamin D deficiency is becoming more common in western countries. The amount of vitamin D in breastmilk depends upon moms vitamin D status. If baby gets enough sunlight, moms deficiency is unlikely to be a problem for baby. However, if baby is not producing enough vitamin D from sunlight exposure, then breastmilk will need to meet a larger percentage of babys vitamin D needs. If mom has minimal exposure to sunlight (see above examples)andis not consuming enough foods or supplements containing vitamin D, then she may be vitamin D deficient.The best way to get vitamin D, the way that our bodies were designed to get the vast majority of our vitamin D, is from sun exposure. Depending upon where you live and how dark your skin is, going outside regularly may beall that is required for you or your baby to generate adequate amounts of vitamin D. However,one of the problems with getting your vitamin D with sun exposure is simply that its hard to determine how much time outside is needed since it depends on so many factors (skin tone, latitude, time of year, how much skin is exposed, amount of air pollution, etc.)Keep in mind that there is also a concern of sunburn and increased risk of skin cancer with too much sun exposure.The primary source of vitamin D for babies, other than sunlight, is the stores that were laid down in babys body prior to birth. Because moms vitamin D status during pregnancy directly affects babys vitamin D stores at birth and particularly during the first 2-3 months, it is very helpful for pregnant women to make sure they are getting enough vitamin D.Adding a vitamin D supplement to moms diet and/or exposure to ultraviolet light will increase the amount of vitamin D in her breastmilk. As long as mom is vitamin D sufficient, her breastmilk will have the right amount of vitamin D. However, babies were designed to get only part of their vitamin D from breastmilk and the remainder from sun exposure  what if baby does not get a minimum amount of sun? A 2015 study [Hollis et al 2015] concludedthat Maternal vitamin D supplementation with 6400 IU/day safely supplies breast milk with adequate vitamin D to satisfy her nursing infants requirement and offers an alternate strategy to direct infant supplementation. Read more about this study and vitamin D in our interview with Dr. Bruce Hollis. A 2004 study [Hollis & Wagner 2004] determined that supplementing the mother with 2000-4000 IU vitamin D per day safely increased mothers and babys vitamin D status: the 2000 IU/d dose resulted in a limited improvement, and A maternal intake of 4000 IU/d could achieve substantial progress toward improving both maternal and neonatal nutritional vitamin D status. A Finnish study [Ala-Houhala 1986] showed that supplementing the mother with 50 g (2000 IU) vitamin D per day was as effective for maintaining babys vitamin D levels as supplementing the baby with 10 g (400 IU) per day.See also:Vitamin D and Breastfeeding: An interview with Bruce Hollis, PhD[top]Vitamin E No known deficiencies of vitamin E have been described in healthy term infants fed human milk. Vitamin E supplements for mothers and their breastfed babies are not indicated.[top]FluorideCurrently there is no evidence indicating that fluoride supplements in infancy improve a breastfed babys dental health. Dr. Ruth Lawrence (in Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession, 7th ed., p.932) states:The supplementation of fluoride in the diet of a healthy breastfed infant is no longer recommended by the AAP. Evidence supports the contention that there is adequate fluoride in human milk, and fluorosis from excessive amounts is a concern.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that fluoride supplements only be given after 6 months, and only to children at high risk for developing cavities and whose primary water source is deficient in fluoride.Many city water systems add fluoride to the water. If you use well water or bottled water, its unlikely that fluoride has been added to your water, but it may still be there. Fluoride occurs naturally in most water, so you really need to know how much fluoride is in your water before you decide whether to supplement.How do you find out how much fluoride is in your drinking water?If you use city water, call your local water department to find out.If you use bottled water, call the bottling company.If you use well water, you can ask your local water department about having your water tested for fluoride  fluoride analysis isnt very expensive.After you know how much fluoride is already in your drinking water and determine whether your child is at high risk for developing cavities, you can decide whether fluoride supplementation might be beneficial.More information:Fluoride Supplements from AskDrSears.comFluoride Dietary Supplementation from the American Academy of PediatricsRozier RG, Adair S, Graham F, et al.

Vitamin K is needed for proper blood clotting, and a deficiency of this vitamin causes a syndrome called Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). Increasing moms vitamin K intake increases the amount of vitamin K in her milk. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends:Intramuscular vitamin K1(phytonadione) at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg should routinely be administered to all infants on the first day to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.A delay of administration until after the first feeding at the breast but not later than 6 hours of age is recommended. A single oral dose of vitamin K should not be used, because the oral dose is variably absorbed and does not provide adequate concentrations or stores for the breastfed infant.Additional information:Vitamin K at Birth: To Inject or Not by Linda Folden Palmer, DC Vitamin K1 Prophylaxis from the British Columbia Reproductive Care Program[top]NiacinNiacin deficiency in breastfed infants in developed countries is extremely rare, and no supplementation is recommended.[top]ZincHealthy full-term breastfed babies do not need additional zinc past what they get from breastmilk and (after 6-8 months) from complementary foods. Good sources of zinc include meat (especially red meat) and yogurt. Signs of a mild zinc deficiency include: lessened appetite, lowered immune function, limited activity, growth faltering. Low birth weight, small for gestational age and premature infants are at risk for zinc deficiency.[top]If youre worried that your baby will need vitamins because your diet is not idealStudies have shown that when a mother is deficient in a certain nutrient, improving the mothers nutrition and/or supplementing her diet (multivitamins, etc.) may be as effective or more effective than giving her baby vitamin supplements.More information @ How does moms diet affect her milk?Vitamins for nursing momsAdditional informationFAQ on Vitamin and Fluoride Supplements for the Breastfed Baby from La Leche League.The Science of Feeding Your Children by Jay Gordon, MDVitamin & Iron Supplements from the American Academy of PediatricsNutrient Information from the the American Society for Nutritional Sciences includes current information on food sources, diet recommendations, deficiencies, toxicity, clinical uses, recent research and references for further information for many micro- and macronutrients.USDA Food Composition DataNutrition Analysis Tool (NAT) from the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department at the University of Illinois[top]ReferencesAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Nutrition.

Breastfeeding: It’s So Easy,http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/cache-bfeasy/,"You hear a lot about how breastfeeding is so good for your baby and it sure is. But in the stressful days of early motherhood, maybe youd like to know about something thats easy for you. The good news is that breastfeeding is just as easy for Mom as it is healthy for baby! What a divine design!Sweet SleepThe convenience factor came up in a conversation around my kitchen table last week, she nursing her 8-week-old boy and I nursing my almost-3-years-old girl. I just cant imagine having to get out of bed in the middle of the night to go get a bottle, and waiting in the cold kitchen for it to warm up. Meanwhile the babys crying, cause when hes hungry, he wants it right away.How much easier it is to roll over (in the family bed), let him latch on, and go right back to sleep! And in the sleep-deprived early years of mothering, that alone makes breastfeeding an all-out winner in my book.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Going Out When babys breastfed and youre going out somewhere, you pick up the diaper bag, you pick up the baby, and youre out of there! When babys on the bottle, thats one more thing to pack and take and carry around (when you already feel like a pack mule). Then youve got to think about how you will keep it cold and sterile until its needed, or find sterile water to mix with the powder, and how will you warm it up when its feeding time. And if you want to do one extra errand, or stay a little longer, or stop off at a friends house, did you plan ahead and bring an extra bottle? For me, thats a lot of extra complications to think about and a significant reduction in my ability to be spontaneous about my choices. To breastfeed all I need is a place to sit down (even the floor will do.) Sweet simplicity.Preparation TimeWith bottle feeding, you constantly need to wash and sterilize bottles and nipples. You need to shop for formula and extra plastic liners, carry them home, then carry the empties out again in the trash. Sometimes you will also get to dump out the unused portions, which at the price of formula is a little like pouring liquid gold down your drain.Breastfeeding, on the other hand, is cheap and always ready with no extra preparation, any time of day or night. The container for breastmilk is elegantly designed (just ask your husband!), and keeps the milk the perfect temperature with no sterilization necessary.Now, if you go back to work early, youll lose a few of the preparation benefits cause youll have to sterilize containers for the times you pump. But youll still get the preparation convenience for those times when youre home and baby gets it straight from Mother Natures faucet, and all the savings in time and money of not buying formula at the store.The PocketbookBreastfeeding is free. It costs zero zip zilch absolutely nothing beyond making sure you eat healthy food (and your own health is the best investment you make, cause youre going to need it to take care of this kid!) So whether youre on food stamps and welfare, or living in the fanciest neighborhood in town, you can give your baby the very best nutrition available in the world. Isnt that great?!Just try to save the extra money for college because studies show that breastfed children tend to have a higher IQ. (Could nursing now mean a scholarship later? Who knows!)The WaistlineBreastfeeding uses up a lot of calories. You get to keep eating a lot (youre even encouraged to do so!) and youll still gradually lose most of the pregnancy weight. Need I say more?When Illness StrikesKids do get sick from time to time. And you thought you were busy before! Perk #1 (and this is a biggie): breastfed kids get sick less often, and very likely get well faster, because theyre healthier to start with and are getting your antibodies through the breastmilk to protect them from disease and to help them recover. Trust me, this is a benefit to you, not just to the child. Youll see what I mean!Perk #2: when every other food comes right back up, theres a very good chance that breastmilk can still be digested. This means that you dont have to worry about dehydration or malnutrition, and is one of the strongest arguments in favor of nursing into toddlerhood. Youll never appreciate breastfeeding more than when you have a 2-year-old who can eat nothing else for a few days. As long as shes nursing, you can let go of some of your fear. And when youve got the flu yourself, breastmilk is something you can feed her without getting out of bed to fix it!When a boo-boo (or a scare) is bigger than a kiss can fix, breastfeeding is the ultimate source of healing comfort. By the way, my kids have never found a need to use a pacifier or a blankie or stuffed animal for security, so weve never had the trying to wash the blankie scenes you read about. Ive read studies about orphaned baby animals in zoos who will bond to a stuffed animal. We all need something to get us through, but Id rather my kids bonded with me than a lump of cloth.The Nursing GiggleThere are moments (days, even) when I wonder why I ever had kids. How did I ever get myself into this? And then, as if on cue from God, theyll do something so incredibly sweet and pure and beautiful that my heart melts, and I wonder why I didnt have two more and do it ten years sooner.I once read that the minutes of breastfeeding were like an island of peace in the middle of a stormy day. When the cry for Noony, Mommy comes, its a guilt-free invitation to sit down (ah.) and to savor the precious, fleeting moments of sweet babyhood in an intimate connection like no other on earth. Breastfeeding is not so much a mothers job as it is one of her rewards for taking on the difficult task of motherhood. Im sure glad I didnt miss it.My son nursed until he was close to 5 years old. I was waiting for this child-led weaning Id read about. It never came. He wasnt about to give up one of the best things in his life. Sometimes Id feel like Id had enough of this nursing thing. Then Id think about how this would probably be my only child, and once I stopped nursing, it would never come into my life again, and I wasnt ready to give it up either.And then there was the nursing giggle. While we were getting situated and pulling out the titty, hed always smile and giggle a special little giggle that I never heard any other time. And Id think, How could I deprive him of something that obviously brings so much joy into his life when its really so simple for me to do. And that special little giggle was one of my rewards for persistence.Getting StartedNow I dont mean to scare you, but some (not all) mothers have a tough time starting the breastfeeding process. I vividly remember sitting in a hospital bed with tears in my eyes and my breasts swelled up like melons, thinking Ill never be able to do this my babys going to starve before I get it right. But with the encouragement of books (mostly Karen Pryors Nursing Your Baby), and a wise pediatrician who assured me I had at least a couple of days before I had to worry about my baby starving, and a loving husband urging me on, I kept on trying till we got it so right that it was as natural as breathing.Starting to breastfeed is a learning process for both mom and baby. Even with my second child, I had a hard time getting it going. If you can make it through the first week, you can make it through the first month. And if you can make it through the first month, you can breastfeed forever. So dont give up on one of the most incredible experiences of your life just because you have trouble at first learning a new skill. Give up, and youll wonder and regret. Persist, and youll know and be rewarded.It Feels GoodWhen I was pregnant, I couldnt imagine being able to tolerate a baby even touching my nipples. Lo, and behold, it didnt feel strange at all. At the beginning, there was some soreness (try a wet teabag really!) and I had a couple of short-term breast infections (keep nursing and dont wear a tight bra). Most of the time, feeling a sweet-smelling, soft, warm infant snuggled against your skin and suckling (and looking up at you) is relaxing, comfortable, and enjoyable. Theres really nothing else quite like it.Pride and Self EsteemWant to work on your self-esteem issues? Try breastfeeding in public! Lets face it, there are a lot of people out there (sometimes theyre in your own family) who will think (and even tell you) that youre doing the wrong thing. Yes, these folks believe, even after countless centuries of evolution and/or divine design, that breastfeeding is a dirty, messy, sinful, or inferior method of feeding a baby. Theyre convinced that modern Science (with all its homage to the profit motive), after investing just a couple decades of Sacred Research, has discovered every nutrient a baby could possibly need and put it in a nice, neat can. Yeah, right. Trust me, theres absolutely nothing in the Bible that says thou shalt not breastfeed. (How do you think Mary fed Jesus?!)Your body was created by God, a Higher Power, or the forces of evolution (whichever you see fit to believe) with breasts in order to deliver the most perfect food for babies, at the perfect temperature, at any time, in the most nurturing, comforting manner, from a sterile, portable, self-maintaining container and dont let any fool, no matter how well-meaning, tell you any different! The relationship between a breastfeeding mother and her baby is sacred and inviolable, filled with purity, innocence, and selfless service.Its not hard to be reasonably discrete (wear two-piece outfits and try to stay fairly covered up). Besides, why in the world are some people embarrassed to see a mother breastfeeding, when theyll watch abuse and murder on TV and call that entertainment? Isnt this a strange culture we live in? When the world around you is insane, the essence of sanity is to choose that which is life-affirming and nurturing, even if (perhaps, especially when) its not socially approved.When you breastfeed in public, do it with dignity and great pride. You are demonstrating the highest and holiest way of nurturing new life. You are giving your child the best possible start in life, physically, emotionally, and intellectually, no matter what your economic situation. You are serving as a model for other mothers to learn from and gain the courage to breastfeed. You are showing bottle-fed children that theres another way they can feed the babies they will someday have. You are doing a very good thing and you have earned the right to be proud and thats where true self-esteem comes from.Get the Perks and Feel NobleNow that you know the facts, please choose breastfeeding for yourself and your baby. Where else can you reap so many benefits for yourself, and still feel noble and proud of yourself at the same time? What a deal! Enjoy it! Lytingale 1996 Lois J.

Is my baby lactose intolerant?,http://kellymom.com/health/baby-health/lactose-intolerance/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIf your baby is sensitive to dairy products it is highly unlikely that the problem is lactose intolerance, although many people may tell you so.There are three types of lactose intolerance:Primary lactose intoleranceCongenital lactose intoleranceSecondary lactose intolerancePrimary lactose intolerance (also called developmental, late-onset or adult lactose intolerance) is relatively common in adults (and more common in some nationalities than others), and is caused by a slow decrease in the bodys production of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar). This occurs gradually, over a period of years, and never appears before 2-5 years old and often not until young adulthood. Almost all adults who are lactose intolerant have this type of lactose intolerance, which is not related to lactose intolerance in babies.Congenital lactose intolerance and similar congenital disordersCongenital lactose intolerance is very rare and is an inherited metabolic disorder rather than an allergy. This disorder is generally apparent within a few days after birth and is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and failure to thrive. It resolves after the age of six months.A similar, less severe, metabolic disorder is congenital lactase deficiency. This disorder, apparent within 10 days of birth, occurs when brush-border lactase activity (required for the digestion of lactose) in the small intestine is low or absent at birth and is characterized by diarrhea and malabsorption. It is also very rare.Galactosemia is another rare metabolic disorder that occurs when the liver enzyme GALT, needed to break down galactose, is partially or completely absent. Although this disorder does not directly concern lactose, babies with the more severe forms of galactosemia will not be able to tolerate any lactose since lactose is formed from the two sugars galactose and glucose. The classical form of galactosemia (where GALT is completely absent) is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice and failure to thrive within a few days after birth. Duarte Galactosemia, a variant of classic galactosemia, is not as severe and baby may be able to be partially or fully breastfed.Some premature babies have a temporary form of lactose intolerance (developmental lactose deficiency) because their bodies are not yet producing lactase. This will go away as baby matures, and in fact the maturation process can be accelerated by babys ingestion of lactose. One option is to add lactase to babys feedings (instead of switching to lactose-free formula, which is nutritionally inadequate).Secondary lactose intolerance (also called acquired lactose intolerance) can appear at any age and occurs when the intestinal brush border is damaged by an infectious, allergic or inflammatory process, thus reducing lactase activity. Causes of secondary lactose intolerance include gastroenteritis, food intolerance or allergy, celiac disease (gluten intolerance), and bowel surgery. Per Joy Anderson, IBCLC (in Lactose intolerance and the breastfed baby):Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Anything that damages the gut lining, even subtly, can cause secondary lactose intolerance. The enzyme lactase is produced in the very tips of folds of the intestine, and anything that causes damage to the gut may wipe off these tips and reduce the enzyme production.Secondary lactose intolerance is a temporary state as long as the gut damage can heal. When the cause of the damage to the gut is removed, for example the food to which a baby is allergic is taken out of the diet, the gut will heal even if the baby is still fed breastmilk.Although cows milk protein sensitivity and lactose intolerance are not the same thing, they can sometimes occur at the same time, since food allergy can cause secondary lactose intolerance.In addition to the different types of lactose intolerance, baby might also experience a lactose overload, caused by breastmilk oversupply (also called foremilk-hindmilk imbalance).Lactose Overload can occur in baby when mom has an oversupply of milk. The milk that baby gets earlier in a feeding (foremilk) is higher in lactose and lower in fat than the milk later in the feeding (hindmilk). Per Diana West, IBCLC (in Is my babys fussiness caused by the lactose in my milk?):As baby begins nursing, the first thing he receives is this lower-fat foremilk, which quenches his thirst. Babys nursing triggers the mothers milk ejection reflex, which squeezes milk and the sticking fat cells from the milk-making cells into the ducts. This higher-fat hindmilk mixes with the high-lactose foremilk and baby receives the perfect food, with fat calories for growth and lactose for energy and brain development. However, when milk production is too high, baby may fill up on the foremilk and then have difficulty digesting all the lactose that is not balanced by fat. This is known as foremilk/hindmilk imbalance or oversupply...Although infants are not lactose intolerant by nature, a high volume of lactose can overwhelm a babys digestive system. When there is not enough lactase to break down all the lactose, the excess lactose causes gassiness and discomfort, and frequently green, watery or foamy stools. Over time, large amounts of undigested lactose can irritate the lining of the intestines so that even a little bit passing through can cause irritation. Occasionally, this can result in small amounts of bleeding into stools that can be misdiagnosed as a food allergy. Some pediatricians will mistakenly diagnose lactose intolerance if there is undigested sugar in the babys stool.See also @  :Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed BabiesAdditional informationLactose Intolerance and the breastfed baby by Joy AndersonColic in the Breastfed Baby by Jack Newman, MDIs my babys fussiness caused by the lactose in my milk? by Diana West, BA, IBCLCBorderline Galactosemia by Rama Ganesan, from New Beginnings, Vol. 14 No. 4, July-August 1997, pp. 123-24.Tan-Dy CRY, Ohlsson A.

My baby is gassy. Is this caused by something in my diet?,http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/gassybaby/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCDoes a mom need to watch everything she eats to avoid having a gassy baby?Some causes of gas in babiesFrequently Asked Questions about breastfeeding and gassy babiesPopular treatments for gas in babiesAdditional InformationDoes a mom need to watch everything                 she eats to avoid having a gassy baby?The idea that certain foods in any moms diet will cause gas in                 her baby is incredibly persistent but is not founded in research.                 If certain foods in moms diets were an overall problem for most                 babies, we would expect that cultures that emphasize those foods                 would have more gassy and fussy babies, but this does not occur                 at all.This is not to say that certain foods would not bother a particular                 baby  this does happen occasionally (and its more likely with                 very young babies). However, there is no list of foods that every                 mom should avoid while breastfeeding. In fact, most babies are                 fine with any food that mom eats, so there is no reason to                 avoid a food unless you notice an obvious reaction in your baby                 every time you eat a particular food.Most babies are gassy from time to time, some more than others. Gassiness is often worse at night. This is due, on the most part,                 to babys immature digestive system and has nothing to do                 with what mom does or eats. Because so many people promote the idea                 that food in moms diet causes gas, many a breastfeeding mom will                 immediately assume it is due to something she has eaten if her baby                 is gassy.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The list of foods that might cause gas is practically endless,                 and moms who try to avoid all these foods will (needlessly)                 have a *very* limited diet. Formula-feeding moms blame it on a chill,                 a draft, the formula type, the formula being too hot or cold, baby                 being overdressed, underdressed, jostled too much, etc. Formula-feeding                 moms never think it was what the cow ate the day she was milked,                 months ago!Some causes of gas in babiesMany young babies have a certain amount of gas and seem to strain as it is passed or as a bowel movement occurs simply because of the immaturity of their digestive system. This doesnt always indicate a problem. Most babies bodies manage gas more easily with growth, maturity, and greater activity. As long as your baby is not overly bothered by the gas or has no other symptoms of food sensitivity or other problems, then tincture of time is likely the best solution.Too much milk too fast, so that baby gulps and chokes and takes in too much air along with the milk. See forceful let-down.Anything that causes baby to take in too much air may result in a gassy baby (what goes in must come out!):Crying  Babies swallow air when they are crying, so crying   is more likely to be the cause of gas, rather than the   result of gas. Respond to babys   feeding cues promptly.Bottlefeeding  Babies usually swallow more air when drinking   from a bottle. When using bottles, use the slowest-flow nipples   so baby doesnt get overwhelmed with the milk flow. To reduce   air swallowing, keep baby at about a 45 degree angle (rather   than lying down), make sure baby has a good seal on the base   of the nipple, and keep the bottle tilted so the neck &   nipple are filled with milk. There are also varieties of bottles   that aim to reduce air swallowing. Dont let baby suck on an   empty bottle. Burp baby more often if he seems to be swallowing   too much air.Overabundant milk supply. See Too Much Milk?Thrush can cause gassiness in babies.Babies who skip several days between stools tend to be gassier. Older breastfed babies (after the first 6-8 weeks) can go several days without a stool. Ten days or more is not uncommon! The long periods between stools in a baby who is obviously thriving is not a cause for concern if the babys abdomen remains soft, baby is content and alert, and the stool is soft and profuse if several days have gone by.Sensitivity to something in mothers diet, including any vitamin/iron supplements, etc. See Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies. If this is the reason, you will most likely notice other symptoms, such as excessive spitting up or vomiting, colic, diarrhea, rash, persistent congestion or runny nose.Anything that baby is eating/drinking other than mothers milk, including vitamins, formula, teas, medications or herbs, solids, juice. Any substance (other than breastmilk) has a much greater potential to increase gassiness rather than reduce it.Formula feeding tends to cause more gas and digestive upset for most babies because it is not specific to the human baby. Formula-fed babies overall tend to spit up more, be constipated more, have more gas, be more colicky, have more intestinal illnesses, etc. Remember, too, that supplementation most always undermines your milk supply and may result in premature weaning.Frequently Asked Questions                 about breastfeeding and gassy babiesBreastmilk is made from what passes into moms blood, not what                 is in her stomach or digestive track. Below are a few common questions                 that moms have about breastfeeding and gassy babies.Can drinking carbonated sodas cause gas in baby? No.                 For something to pass into your milk, it must first pass into your                 bloodstream. Its the carbonation in sodas, etc. that can cause                 gas in mom. The bubbles in a carbonated drink cannot pass into your                 milk and affect baby. If this could happen, youd have carbonated                 blood and carbonated milk!If mom is gassy, can that make baby gassy? No. Gas in moms                 body cannot pass into breastmilk.See also Can a nursing                 mother eat this food? which includes a discussion of How                 will eating gassy foods affect baby?Popular treatments for                 gas in babiesTimeFor most babies, the number one most effective treatment                 for gas is TIME. Babies are born with an immature digestive system,                 and it needs time to mature. Until this happens, baby is likely                 to be gassy no matter what you do. Some babies wake up           around 3-4 weeks to all the new GI sensations they are feeling and           get really unhappy about it. If you cannot find an apparent cause for your babys gassiness, he probably just needs a little more           time to mature.Gripe water,                 fennel tea or other herbal remedies    Herbal remedies have been used for gassy babies for a countless                 number of years. I prefer to avoid using herbal remedies for gas                 in young babies. Here are my reasons:In a healthy baby, anything other than breastmilk is more likely to cause problems rather than solve them.Giving baby substances other than breastmilk can alter the intestinal flora and reduce the protective qualities of exclusive breastfeeding, thus making baby more susceptable to illness and allergies. See Why Delay Solids? for more on this.Many of these products contain mixtures of herbs or other substances, thus putting baby more at risk for adverse reactions. Some contain alcohol, so read labels very carefully.Most of these products have not been tested in infants for safety or effectiveness.It is more effective to look at treating the causes, rather than simply trying to treat the symptoms.Note: Star                 anise has been associated with illness ranging from serious                 neurological effects, such as seizures, to vomiting, jitteriness                 and rapid eye movement.Mint tea is sometimes used for gas and gas pains. Peppermint oil                 and tea can be dangerous if given directly to babies. Large amounts                 of peppermint or spearmint are known to decrease milk supply, and                 mint tea is traditionally used for decreasing milk supply  breastfeeding                 mothers should avoid drinking mint tea regularly or in large amounts.Simethicone                 drops (Mylicon, Ovol)This medication is considered quite safe, as it is not absorbed                 by the body. It breaks down bubbles of gas trapped in the stomach                 and the intestines. Whether this treatment is effective is                 a different story, however. In clinical trials, simethicone drops                 have been shown to be effective in reducing the total amount of                 gas passed. However, they have not been shown to be more                 effective than a placebo when the study focused on babys total         crying time and the severity of colic-like episodes.Garrison MM, Christakis DA.

Its generally recommended that you eat whatever you like, whenever you like, in the amounts that you like and continue to do this unless you notice an obvious reaction in your baby.There is no list of foods that every nursing mom should avoid because most nursing mothers can eat anything they want, and because the babies who are sensitive to certain foods are each unique  what bothers one may not bother another.My baby is gassy. Is this caused by something in my diet?Questions about specific foodsNormal Baby FussinessMost infant fussiness is normal for a young baby, and is not related to foods in moms diet. If your baby is sensitive to something you are eating, you will most likely notice other symptoms in addition to fussiness, such as excessive spitting up or vomiting, colic, rash or persistent congestion. Fussiness that is not accompanied by other symptoms and calms with more frequent nursing is probably not food-related.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Read more here about normal baby fussiness.Possible signs of food allergyA small percentage of breastfeeding mothers notice an obvious difference in their babys behavior and/or health when they eat certain foods. Cows milk products are the most common problem foods and the only foods conclusively linked by research to fussiness/gassiness in babies, but some babies do react to other foods. Food sensitivities in breastfed babies are not nearly as common as many breastfeeding mothers have been led to think, however.If a breastfed baby is sensitive to a particular food, then he may be fussy after feedings, cry inconsolably for long periods, or sleep little and wake suddenly with obvious discomfort. There may be a family history of allergies. Other signs of a food allergy may include: rash, hives, eczema, sore bottom, dry skin; wheezing or asthma; congestion or cold-like symptoms; red, itchy eyes; ear infections; irritability, fussiness, colic; intestinal upsets, vomiting, constipation and/or diarrhea, or green stools with mucus or blood.The severity of a food reaction is generally related to the degree of babys sensitivity and to the amount of the problem food that mom atethe more food eaten and the greater babys sensitivity, the more severe the reaction. Food reactions may occur within minutes, but symptoms in breastfed babies more commonly show up 4-24 hours after exposure. If baby has an acute reaction to a new food, or to a food that mom ate a large amount of, then he will probably be back to normal within a couple of hours. If baby is sensitive to a food that mom eats frequently, symptoms may be ongoing.Recognizing and Avoiding Food AllergiesHow long does it take for what I eat to get into my breastmilk? by Anne Smith, BA, IBCLC What foods are most likely to be a problem?Some of the most likely suspects are cows milk products, soy, wheat, corn, eggs, and peanuts.Other suspect foods:Any food that a family member is allergic toA food that mom recently ate a large amount ofA new food (if babys symptoms are new)A food that mom doesnt like, but is eating while breastfeeding (and/or ate while pregnant) for the benefit of her babyA food that mom craves, or feels she has to have after a bad dayConscious likes and dislikes of foods are signals that your body may be reacting to them in an abnormal way.Keeping a food journal with a record of foods eaten and babys behavior/symptoms, with time of day for each, may be helpful when trying to pinpoint a problem food.What if a specific food appears to be a problem?If you think your baby is reacting to a particular food, then eliminate that food from your diet for 2-3 weeks to see if babys symptoms improve. If babys symptoms do improve, then this food may be a problem for your baby. Eliminating a food for less than 2-3 weeks may not be effectivecows milk protein, for example, can persist in moms body for 1  2 weeks, and it may be another 1  2 weeks before the protein is out of babys system.Babys symptoms will usually begin to improve within 5-7 days of eliminating a problem food. Your baby may not improve immediately, however, especially if the reaction is to a food that has been a regular part of moms diet. Some babies seem to feel worse for about a week before symptoms begin to improve. Sometimes it takes several weeks to see an improvement.One way to confirm that a particular food is a problem for your baby is to eat that food again to see whether baby has the same reaction. The more severe your babys original symptoms, the longer you may wish to wait before reintroducing it into your dietfor a very severe reaction you may not reintroduce the food at all. If you reintroduce a food and your baby does not have the same reaction as before, then baby is probably not sensitive to that food. If he does react in the same way, you will want to limit or avoid this food for a time  until baby is older or in some cases until baby has weaned.If baby is only a little sensitive to a particular food, you may be able to simply limit the amount that you eat, rather than eliminate that food altogether. Most babies grow out of food sensitivities within several months to a year, but some food allergies persist long-term.Dairy sensitivity in babiesIs my baby lactose intolerant?Image credit: flickr Jules Morgan CC BY 2.0If your baby is sensitive to dairy products it is highly unlikely that the problem is lactose intolerance, although many people may tell you so.See Is my baby lactose intolerant? for more information.Although cows milk protein sensitivity and lactose intolerance are not the same thing, they can sometimes occur at the same time, since food allergy can cause secondary lactose intolerance. Sensitivity to cows milk proteinsBreastfed babies who are sensitive to dairy in moms diet are sensitive to specific cows milk antibodies, in the form of proteins (not lactose), which pass into the mothers milk. Cows milk (either in the mothers diet or engineered into formula) is a common source of food sensitivity in babies. Cows milk sensitivity or allergy can cause colic-like symptoms, eczema, wheezing, vomiting, diarrhea (including bloody diarrhea), constipation, hives, and/or a stuffy, itchy nose.If your baby is sensitive to dairy in your diet, it will not help to switch to lactose-free dairy products. The problem is the cows milk proteins, not the lactose. Cooking dairy products may reduce but will not eliminate the allergens.A significant percentage of babies with cows milk protein allergy will also react to soy. Most dairy-allergic babies will also react to goats milk or sheeps milk. Some will also react to beef.If you think that your baby may be sensitive to dairy products in your diet, remember that it can take 10 days to 3 weeks to eliminate cows milk protein from your systemallow a full 2-3 weeks of dairy elimination before evaluating the results.If your baby is only a little sensitive to dairy proteins, you may be able to relieve babys symptoms by eliminating only the obvious sources of dairy (milk, cream, yogurt, butter, cheese, sour cream, ice cream, cottage cheese, etc.); you may even be able to eat small amounts of dairy without it affecting baby.If your baby is highly allergic, it will be necessary to eliminate all sources of dairy proteins, which requires a careful reading of food labels. See the Hidden Dairy Cheat Sheet ().If youve cut out dairy because your breastfed baby is sensitive to cows milk proteins, you may be able to phase it back in after a few months. Many dairy-sensitive babies outgrow their sensitivity by 6-18 months, and most outgrow it by 3 years.If you reintroduce dairy into your diet and baby reacts, cut out dairy products again for at least another month. If babys allergy to cows milk protein via breastmilk is severe, its best to wait at least 6 months before trying to reintroduce dairy. For allergic babies, avoiding the allergen makes it less likely that baby will develop a lifelong or life threatening allergy.Nondairy calcium sources (plus info on calcium supplements) Additional information Related web pages at this siteCluster Feeding and Fussy EveningsMy baby is fussy!

This article article outlines a set of clinical guidelines for rational management of the prevention and treatment of hypoglycemia in breastfed infants. Summary: Healthy, full-term infants are functionally and metabolically programmed to make the transition from their intrauterine dependent environment to their extrauterine existence without the need for metabolic monitoring or interference with the natural breastfeeding process. Full-term infants are equipped with homeostatic mechanisms that preserve adequate energy substrate to the brain and other vital organs. Thermal stability and early, properly guided, frequent, exclusive breastfeeding are the keys to success. Thus, routine screening for blood glucose concentrations or feeding sugar water is not necessary and potentially counterproductive to the establishment of a healthy mother-infant dyad.Cornblath M, et al. Controversies regarding definition of neonatal hypoglycemia: suggested operational thresholds. Pediatrics. 2000 May;105(5):1141-5.Summary: The definition of clinically significant hypoglycemia remains one of the most confused and contentious issues in contemporary neonatology. In this article, some of the reasons for these contentions are discussed. Pragmatic recommendations for operational thresholds, ie, blood glucose levels at which clinical interventions should be considered, are offered in light of current knowledge to aid health care providers in neonatal medicine. Future areas of research to resolve some of these issues are also presented.Hawdon JM. Hypoglycaemia and the neonatal brain. Eur J Pediatr. 1999 Dec;158 Suppl 1:S9-S12.Abstract: There has been much controversy and confusion regarding potential damage caused to the neonatal brain by low blood glucose levels. Previous studies of outcome after neonatal hypoglycaemia are flawed by many factors including retrospective data collection and inability to control for co-existing clinical complications. There is no doubt that hypoglycaemic brain damage does occur but the severity and duration of low blood glucose levels required to cause lasting harm varies between subjects and is related to the ability of each baby to mount a protective response such as the production of ketone bodies which are alternative cerebral fuels. Evidence from studies of humans and other animals suggests that cortical damage and long-term sequelae occur after prolonged hypoglycaemia sufficiently severe to cause neurological signs.CONCLUSION: Prolonged hypoglycaemia should be avoided by close clinical observation of vulnerable infants whilst avoiding excessively invasive management in populations of neonates which may jeopardize the successful establishment of breast feeding.Hawdon JM, Platt MP, Aynsley-Green A.

In this review article neonatal hypoglycaemia is defined, monitoring of babies for this condition is discussed and implications for baby feeding practices are stated.Hawdon JM, Ward Platt MP, Aynsley-Green A. Patterns of metabolic adaptation for preterm and term infants in the first neonatal week. Arch Dis Child. 1992 Apr;67(4 Spec No):357-65.Abstract: There have been few comprehensive accounts of the relationships between glucose and other metabolic fuels during the first postnatal week, especially in the context of modern feeding practices. A cross sectional study was performed of 156 term infants and 62 preterm infants to establish the normal ranges and interrelationships of blood glucose and intermediary metabolites in the first postnatal week, and to compare these with those of 52 older children. Blood glucose concentrations varied more for preterm than for term infants (1.5-12.2 mmol/l v 1.5-6.2 mmol/l), and preterm infants had low ketone body concentrations, even at low blood glucose concentrations. Breast feeding of term infants and enteral feeding of preterm infants appeared to enhance ketogenic ability. Term infants had lower prefeed blood glucose concentrations than children but, like children, appeared to be capable of producing ketone bodies. This study demonstrates that neonatal blood glucose concentrations should be considered in the context of availability of other metabolic fuels, and that the preterm infant has a limited ability to mobilise alternative fuels.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
My baby fusses or cries when breastfeeding – what’s the problem?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/fussy-while-nursing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC Lsantilli - Fotolia.comSome babies will fuss, cry or pull off the breast during breastfeeding. There are a number of reasons why this might be happening. Its pretty common to see this type of behavior at around 6-8 weeks, though it can occur at any time. If your baby is generally fussy (not just when nursing) see My baby is fussy! Is something wrong? Determining the problemHere are some of the problem-solving steps I go through when my baby is fussy at the breast or a mother asks me why her baby is fussing while breastfeeding:How old is baby? Most babies go through growth spurts during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, etc. Many babies are fussy during growth spurts.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Is baby working on anything new developmentally? Babies who are starting to notice the world around them can be notoriously distractible. Any kind of new developmental step that baby is working on can affect nursing temporarily, whether it be fussy nursing behavior or simply more frequent nursing.When is baby fussing? To figure out the cause its helpful to pay attention to when the fussy behavior happens, both during the nursing session and during the day.If baby is fussy right when your milk is letting down (or immediately after), theres a good chance that the fussy nursing is related to a fast let-down. If baby is fussy before let-down, or a few minutes into nursing (and a while after let-down), then baby may be impatient for the fast flow of milk that comes with let-down. Fussing at the end of a nursing session (or what seems to be the end) may mean that baby needs to burp, or is ready to finish nursing, or just wants to suck (and doesnt want to deal with a new let-down at this point), or wants to continue nursing on the other side or with a faster flow of milk.If the fussy behavior is mainly in the mornings, it might be due to a faster than usual let-down if baby has just had a longer sleep period and moms breasts are fuller than usual. If baby is fussier during evening nursings, it may be due to the normal fussy time that most babies have during the evening. Although most babies dont react to foods that mom eats, some do. If you eat a particular food at about the same time each day (or most days) and baby has a regular time where she fusses during nursing, try not eating that food for a week or two to see if things improve.Does fussing occur on both sides equally or only on one side? Most moms have a faster let-down and/or a more abundant milk supply on one side than the other, so if your baby fusses more on one side, it may be due to these differences.What else is going on with baby? Is she sick or teething? Is something new or different going on in her environment? Has she started solids or is she trying a new food? Is she exhibiting other symptoms besides the fussy nursing? Below are discussions of some of the different things that can lead to fussy nursing behavior. Keep in mind that the problem may also be a combination of several things.Does baby need to burp?Many babies will cry, fuss, pull off the breast, etc. if they need to burp. Try to burp between breasts and after a feeding, but dont worry if baby does not burp and is content. Breastfed babies overall dont take in as much air during a feeding as bottle-fed babies do, so usually dont need to burp as often. If baby has been crying before she nurses, or is so hungry that she nurses frantically or if mom has a fast let-down, baby could be taking in more air and may need to be burped more often.Burping is usually only necessary during the first few months, though it may extend longer. Once your baby is moving more freely, she will be able to relieve the gastric gas herself. This usually will occur between the 4th and 6th month, but may be shorter in some children and longer in others.If baby has a hard time burping, try burping more often during a feeding. The best burping position is one that applies firm pressure to the babys tummy. Placing baby over the shoulder way up so that there is pressure on babys abdomen often works well. Walking around while doing this might distract her long enough to get a good burp. You may even want to lie baby down on her stomach and burp her that way. Growth spurtBabies often pull off and fuss during growth spurts. Most babies go through growth spurts, sometimes called frequency days, during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). More growth spurt information in this link. Distractible babyIf baby seems to be pulling off the breast at any distraction (real or imaginary), then see The Distractible Baby. Forceful let-downSome babies will pull off the breast soon after let-down if mom has a forceful let-down. Baby may be frustrated by the too-fast flow of milk with let-down. A too-forceful let-down can also cause excessive gas or spitting up/vomiting. There is more information here on symptoms of and how to deal with a fast let-down reflex. Slow let-downSome babies get very impatient if mom has a slow let-down. There is more information here on speeding up a slow let-down reflex. Baby wants a faster milk flowEven very young babies can be quick to notice that pulling off, kneading the breast, etc. can cause an additional let-down, and can facilitate a faster, easier milk flow. Some babies become impatient with the slower milk flow following the initial fast flow at let-down. This may or may not be related to a slow let-down.When a feeding begins at the breast there are drops of milk. Then when the initial let-down occurs (several seconds to a minute into the feeding), the milk flow speeds up quite a bit. At that time it may drip very quickly, squirt, or even spray. Some minutes later it slows again and the baby must continue to suck vigorously in order to elicit further let-downs. This pattern can continue through successive, multiple let-downs as long as the baby is continuing to nurse vigorously. Eventually, baby will learn that the flow will pick back up again if shell only continue to vigorously suck/swallow.With bottle feeding, the flow is instant and continuous. The baby is required to work very little. Once a baby has had a bottle, especially a lot of bottles, she may begin to prefer the ease of bottle-feeding over the work of breastfeeding. She may become frustrated at the breast after the first let-down occurs and the flow of milk begins to slow.If baby is getting bottles you might consider putting them away, at least for a while. When you must use a bottle, only use a newborn nipple for as long as baby will tolerate it so that she never gets a really fast flow of milk from the bottle, but has to work a little more to get the milk.Sometimes babies of moms with oversupply or fast let-down will also get very used to the fast flow and object when it normally slows somewhere between 3 weeks to 3 months.It can be helpful to do some breast compression when this fussiness starts or right before you expect it to. This will help speed up the milk flow again. Once compression stops helping, try switching baby to the other side when she begins to fuss and back and forth again (after using compression) as you need to. Baby is done nursing for the momentIf baby is fussing after shes been nursing for a while, and youve ruled out other causes, she may be in the process of changing her nursing pattern. Babies become very efficient at the breast with growth and maturity. They can milk the breast in a lot less time per feeding session than they required before. Babys frustration may just be a sign that shes finished and wants to move on.On a similar note, an occasional baby will just want to suck at the end of a nursing session and the flow of milk with let-down frustrates her. You might see if offering her a finger or pacifier (if baby is older than 4-6 weeks) to suck on during these times seems to help. Baby prefers one sideSometimes babies will refuse or fuss at a breast when the let-down is slower or too forceful, or the supply a bit lower. They in turn will prefer the side which lets down more/less quickly and in which the supply is more bountiful. See also: Lopsided! What can I do?Fussy in the eveningMany young babies tend to pull off and fuss at the breast in the evening. See the article Cluster Feeding and Fussy Evenings. TeethingTeething can cause fussy nursing behavior, as some babies experience gum discomfort with sucking. Baby might start to nurse, but then pull off and cry or fuss and not want to nurse anymore. See Teething for more information and tips. ThrushFrequent pulling off the breast can be a symptom of thrush. Stuffy noseA stuffy nose can cause fussy nursing behavior. If your baby has a stuffy nose and is having a hard time breathing and nursing at the same time, see colds & congestion. Allergy or food sensitivitySome babies with allergies or food sensitivities exhibit fussy nursing behavior. Often when there is a sensitivity to something in moms diet, baby will come to the breast hungry but when she tastes/smells something in the milk that will cause her GI distress, she pulls off, bats her head back and forth, etc. Sensitivities to foods in moms diet are rare. If this is the problem, you will most likely notice other symptoms, such as excessive spitting up or vomiting, colic, diarrhea, rash, persistent congestion or runny nose, or excessive gas. More information on food sensitivities in babies and links to more allergy information can be found in my article Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies.

Spitting Up & Reflux in the Breastfed Baby,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/reflux/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC Paul Hakimata  Fotolia.comMy baby spits up  is this a problem?Spitting up, sometimes called physiological or uncomplicated reflux, is common in babies and is usually (but not always) normal. Most young babies spit up sometimes, since their digestive systems are immature, making it easier for the stomach contents to flow back up into the esophagus (the tube connecting mouth to stomach).Babies often spit up when they get too much milk too fast. This may happen when baby feeds very quickly or aggressively, or when moms breasts are overfull. The amount of spitup typically appears to be much more than it really is. If baby is very distractible (pulling off the breast to look around) or fussy at the breast, he may swallow air and spit up more often. Some babies spit up more when they are teething, starting to crawl, or starting solid foods.A few statistics (for all babies, not just breastfed babies):Spitting up usually occurs right after baby eats, but it may also occur 1-2 hours after a feeding.Half of all 0-3 month old babies spit up at least once per day.Spitting up usually peaks at 2-4 months.Many babies outgrow spitting up by 7-8 months.Most babies have stopped spitting up by 12 months.If your baby is a Happy Spitter gaining weight well, spitting up without discomfort and content most of the time  spitting up is a laundry & social problem rather than a medical issue.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. Some causes of excessive spitting upBreastmilk oversupply or forceful let-down (milk ejection reflex) can cause reflux-like symptoms, and usually can be remedied with simple measures.Food sensitivities can cause excessive spitting. The most likely offender is cows milk products (in babys or moms diet). Other things to ask yourself: is baby getting anything other than breastmilk  formula, solids (including cereal), vitamins (fluoride, iron, etc.), medications, herbal preparations? Is mom taking any medications, herbs, vitamins, iron, etc.?Babies with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) usually spit up a lot (see below).Although seldom seen in breastfed babies, regular projectile vomiting in a newborn can be a sign of pyloric stenosis, a stomach problem requiring surgery. It occurs 4 times more often in boys than in girls, and symptoms usually appear between 3 and 5 weeks of age. Newborns who projectile vomit at least once a day should be checked out by their doctor. My older baby just started spitting up more  whats up?Some older babies will start spitting up more after a period of time with little or no spitting up. Its not unusual to hear of this happening around 6 months, though you also see it at other ages. If the spitting up is very frequent (particularly if baby does not seem well), consider the possibility of a GI illness.If baby does not seem ill, then here are some possible causes:Its unlikely that your baby has suddenly developed a sensitivity to something in your milk, unless theres something really new in your diet or youre eaten LOTS of a particular food very recently. Any foods that baby eats are more likely than moms foods to cause the spitting up. Has baby started solids recently or tried a new food? Are you or baby taking any new medications? Have you or baby started taking vitamins or changed your vitamins?Has baby been fussier than normal, and/or crying more lately? If so, he is probably swallowing more air than usual, which can cause the spitting up.Spitting up can be caused by teething. When teething, babies tend to drool more and often swallow a lot of that extra saliva  this can cause extra spitting up.A cold or allergies can result in baby swallowing mucus and spitting up more.Baby may be hitting a growth spurt and swallowing more air when he nurses, especially if hes been guzzling lately.If you tend to have oversupply or a fast let-down, some moms see renewed symptoms (which can include spitting up) after a growth spurt.Essentially, though, if your baby is healthy and doing well despite the spitting up  gaining well, having enough wet/dirty diapers  then this is a laundry problem rather than a medical issue. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)A small percentage of babies experience discomfort and other complications due to reflux  this is called Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. These babies have been termed by some as Scrawny Screamers (as compared to the Happy Spitters). There seems to be a family tendency toward reflux. GERD is particularly common in preemies (due to their immaturity) and in babies with other health problems. GERD usually improves by 12-24 months.Following are symptoms of GERD  there are varying degrees and need your doctors involvement to diagnose:Frequent spitting up or vomiting; discomfort when spitting up. Some babies with GERD do not spit up  silent reflux occurs when the stomach contents only go as far as the esophagus and are then re-swallowed, causing pain but no spitting up.Gagging, choking, frequent burping or hiccoughing, bad breath.Baby may be fussy and sleep less due to discomfort.Warning signs of severe reflux:Inconsolable or severe fussiness or crying associated with feedings.Poor weight gain, weight loss, or failure to thrive. Difficulty eating. Breast/food refusal.Difficulty swallowing, sore throat, hoarseness, chronic nasal/sinus congestion, chronic sinus/ear infections.Spitting up blood or green/yellow fluid.Sandifers syndrome: Baby may posture and arch the neck & back to relieve reflux painthis lengthens the esophagus and reduces discomfort.Breathing problems: bronchitis, wheezing, chronic cough, pneumonia, asthma, aspiration, apnea, cyanosis.GERD may cause babies to either undereat (if they associate feeding with the after-feeding pain, or if it hurts to swallow) or overeat (because sucking keeps the stomach contents down in the stomach and because mothers milk is a natural antacid).Current information on reflux indicates that testing or treatment for reflux in babies younger than 12 months should be considered only if spitting up is accompanied by poor weight gain or weight loss, severe choking, lung disease or other complications. Per Donna Secker, MS, RD in the article Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, The infant with significant reflux who seems to be growing well and has no other significant health problems benefits most from little or no therapy.When GERD is suspected, many doctors first try a trial of various reflux medications (without running tests), to see if the medications improve babys symptoms. If testing is done, a 24-hour pH probe study () is the current gold standard for reflux testing in babies; this is a procedure where a tube is placed down babys throat to measure the acid level at the bottom of the esophagus. A barium swallow (upper GI) is not so invasive (baby swallows a barium mixture, then an x-ray is taken) but is not really effective for diagnosing reflux in babies, since most babies will reflux when given barium. An upper GI will not identify whether babys stomach contents are higher in acid or if there has been any esophagus damage due to reflux, but it will show if there are any blockages or narrowing of the stomach valves that may be causing or aggravating the reflux. Additional tests may be recommended in certain circumstances (see the links below for additional information). In rare cases, when baby has very severe reflux that is not relieved by medication, surgery may be recommended. Breastfeeding TipsAim for frequent breastfeeding, whenever baby cues to feed. These smaller, more frequent feedings can be easier to digest.Try positioning baby in a semi-upright or sitting position when breastfeeding, or recline back so that baby is above and tummy-to-tummy with mom. See this information on upright nursing positions.For fussy, reluctant feeders, try lots of skin to skin contact, breastfeeding in motion (rocking, walking), in the bath or when baby is sleepy.Ensure good latch to minimize air swallowing.Allow baby to completely finish one breast (by waiting until baby pulls off or goes to sleep) before you offer the other. Dont interrupt active suckling just to switch sides. Switching sides too soon or too often can cause excessive spitting up (see Too Much Milk?). For babies who want to breastfeed very frequently, try switching sides every few hours instead of at every feed.Encourage non-nutritive/comfort sucking at the breast, since non-nutritive sucking reduces irritation and speeds gastric emptying.Avoid rough or fast movement or unnecessary jostling or handling of your baby right after feeding. Baby may be more comfortable when help upright much of the time. It is often helpful to burp often.As always, watch your baby and follow his cues to determine what works best to ease the reflux symptoms. What can I do to minimize spitting up/reflux?Breastfeed! Reflux is less common in breastfed babies. In addition, breastfed babies with reflux have been shown to have shorter and fewer reflux episodes and less severe reflux at night than formula-fed babies [Heacock 1992]. Breastfeeding is also best for babies with reflux because breastmilk leaves the stomach much faster [Ewer 1994] (so theres less time for it to back up into the esophagus) and is probably less irritating when it does come back up.The more relaxed your infant is, the less the reflux.Eliminate all environmental tobacco smoke exposure, as this is a significant contributing factor to reflux.Reduce or eliminate caffeine. Excessive caffeine in moms diet can contribute to reflux.Allergy should be suspected in all infant reflux cases. According to a review article in Pediatrics [Salvatore 2002], up to half of all GERD cases in babies under a year are associated with cows milk protein allergy. The authors note that symptoms can be similar and recommend that pediatricians screen all babies with GERD for cows milk allergy. Allergic babies generally have other symptoms in addition to spitting up.Positioning:Reflux is worst when baby lies flat on his back.Many parents have found that carrying baby in a sling or other baby carrier can be helpful.Avoid compressing babys abdomen  this can increase reflux and discomfort. Dress baby in loose clothing with loose diaper waistbands; avoid slumped over or bent positions; for example, roll baby on his side rather than lifting legs toward tummy for diaper changes.Recent research has compared various positions to determine which is best for babies with reflux. Elevating babys head did not make a significant difference in these studies [Carroll 2002, Secker 2002, Craig 2004], although many moms have found that baby is more comfortable when in an upright position. The positions shown to significantly reduce reflux include lying on the left side and prone (baby on his tummy). Placing the infant in a prone position should only be done when the child is awake and can be continuously monitored. Prone positioning during sleep is almost never recommended due to the increased SIDS risk. [Secker 2002]Although recent research does not support recommendations to keep baby in a semi-upright position (30 elevation), this remains a common recommendation. Positioning at a 60 elevation in an infant seat or swing has been found to increase reflux compared with the prone (tummy down) position [Carroll 2002, Secker 2002].As always, experiment to find what works best for your baby.If your child is taking reflux medications, keep in mind that dosages generally need to be monitored and adjusted frequently as baby grows.What about thickened feeds?Baby cereal, added to thicken breastmilk or formula, has been used as a treatment for GER for many years, but its use is controversial.Does it work? Thickened feeds can reduce spitting up, but studies have not shown a decrease in reflux index scores (i.e., the silent reflux is still present). Per Donna Secker, MS, RD in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, The effect of thickened feedings may be more cosmetic (decreased regurgitation and increased postprandial sleeping) than beneficial. Thickened feeds have been associated with increased coughing after feedings, and may also decrease gastric emptying time and increase reflux episodes and aspiration. Note that rice cereal will not effectively thicken breastmilk due to the amylase (an enzyme that digests carbohydrates) naturally present in the breastmilk.Is it healthy for baby? If you do thicken feeds, monitor babys intake since baby may take in less milk overall and thus decrease overall nutrient intake. There are a number of reasons to avoid introducing cereal and other solids early. There is evidence that the introduction of rice or gluten-containing cereals before 3 months of age increases babys risk for type I diabetes. In addition, babies with GERD are more likely to need all their defenses against allergies, respiratory infections and ear infections  but studies show that early introduction of solids increases babys risk for all of these conditions.The breastfeeding relationship: Early introduction of solids is associated with early weaning. Babies with reflux are already at greater risk for fussy nursing behavior, nursing strikes or premature weaning if baby associates reflux discomfort with breastfeeding.Safety issues: Never add cereal to a bottle without medical supervision if your baby has a weak suck or uncoordinated sucking skills.Additional InformationSpitting Up: Is it Reflux? by Anne Smith, IBCLCLLL FAQ on breastfeeding and refluxGERD and the Breastfed Baby by Sharon Knorr, from Leaven, Vol. 39 No. 1, February-March 2003, pp. 12-13.Breastfeeding the Baby with Gastroesophageal Reflux by Laura Barmby, from New Beginnings, Vol. 15 No. 6, November-December 1998, pp. 175-76.Gastroesophageal Reflux in Young Children by Pamela Tyler, M.S., CCC SLP, Pediatric/Adolescent Gastroesophageal Reflux Association (PAGER)Pediatric Gastroesophageal Reflux general information from Pediatric/Adolescent Gastroesophageal Reflux Association (PAGER)The Childrens Digestive Health and Nutrition Foundation (CDHNF) NASPGHAN Guidelines on Pediatric GERD and  Guidelines Summary on Pediatric GERD from the Childrens Digestive Health and Nutrition Foundation (CDHNF)North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN)Bailey DJ, Andres JM, Danek GD, Pineiro-Carrero VM.

Dads and Breastfeeding (Resources),http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/bf-links-father/,"What About Dad? by Diane Wiessinger, MS, IBCLCFor as long as there have been babies, there have been fathers. But no father in the history of the world ever nursed a baby. If fatherhood doesnt mean feeding, what does it mean? Everything else!Daddies and Breastfeeding by Becky Flora, IBCLCStudies show that when a nursing mother has a significant other who is educated about and supports her choice to breastfeed she is much more likely to be successful at it. For many mothers, this significant other is the babys father. What role can Daddy play?Breastfeeding Facts for Fathers- Child Health Fact SheetsBreastfeeding is as natural a part of life as pregnancy.

Encouraging Teen Moms to Breastfeed,http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/teenbf/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCSome ways to encourage teen moms to breastfeed:Suggest that she try breastfeeding for a few days or weeks. This may encourage her to breastfeed when she might otherwise never even start. Unless she brings up how long she plans to nurse, you might want to avoid discussing long-term commitments to breastfeeding. Avoid being judgmental.Teens accept advice more readily from peers than adults. If you know a teen mom who is successfully breastfeeding, see if you can get her together with the mom-to-be.Be enthusiastic about breastfeeding. Teens are more likely to be attracted to enthusiastic people (someone older may see lots of enthusiasm as being somewhat suspect).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Focus on the advantages for the mother NOW, rather than advantages that will show up sometime on the future. Talking about future health benefits for mom and baby may fall on deaf ears.Following are some benefits that are likely to interest a teen mom:Breastfeeding helps mom lose weight faster without restricting calories. The uterus gets back into shape after birth faster if you breastfeed, thus helping mom get back into shape faster.Moms period comes back later when she breastfeeds.Breastfeeding saves time and can make your life easier. You dont have to prepare and clean bottles. Once mom and baby get the hang of it, mom can breastfeeding and sleep at the same time, breastfeeding and eat at the same time, breastfeeding and talk on the phone at the same time, etc. Breastfeeding also makes things like going out with baby, teething, and babys illnesses easier to handle.You will cancel fewer social events and miss less school/work due to a sick baby.Breastfeeding is free and saves you money on doctor bills.Breastfed babies are more intelligent and healthier.Breastfeeding is green  its better for the environment.You are the only one who can do this. Breastfeeding moms tend to have more confidence in their parenting skills and a greater sense of power over their own lives, which is sometimes hard to find when youre a teen mom. Many a new teen mom (particularly if shes living at home) is worried that her mother (the grandmother) will become more the mother to this baby than she will be.Encourage mom to attend a LLL meeting (or any breastfeeding support group) with her best friend. She might even introduce her friend at the meeting as the babys new aunt or godmother. Many teen moms lose their closest friends as time for the baby arrives. Either the friends are normally moving on to other aspects of life (school, college, jobs) or they just cant relate and feel uncomfortable. Taking a friend to the meeting helps keep mom (or mom-to-be) from feeling overwhelmed, and the friend is included as babys aunt and feels more involved and more apt to stay in touch.Give teen moms extra breastfeeding support when they are in the hospital at birth because many are undecided about breastfeeding right up to the day of delivery.Some of the incorrect things that teen moms have usually heard about breastfeeding that you may need to address:Breastfeeding hurtsBreastfeeding will ruin breast shape and sizeYou need big breasts to breastfeedBreastfeeding will tie you downTeen moms (even more than older moms) are often afraid of being ridiculed if they nurse in public. She may worry about what babys fathers friends (and babys father) will think about her breastfeeding. Talk to her about how to nurse discreetly so that no one knows you are nursing.Studies say that normally the biggest factor as to whether or not a teen mom will breastfeed or continue to breastfeed is whether or not the father of her baby approves. Some benefits that Dad might like:Theres no preparation, no heating, no bottles or dishes to washIts freeformula isnt cheapDiapers dont stinkbreastfed babies produce stool that smells almost sweetespecially when you compare it to the formula-fed kind.A lot of reading can overwhelm a teen mom, so pamphlets or videos are often best as information sources.Many teen moms will be going to school or working after the birth of her baby. Let her know that it is possible to work or go to school while continuing to breastfeed. Even if she doesnt want to pump, breastfeeding is not all or nothing  she can nurse her baby when they are together and supplement when she is away.Young mothers are often told they are too young to be a mother and that they dont know enough to be mothers  breastfeeding is something they can do, and do well. Also, teen moms who breastfeed tend to get more hands-on contact with their baby  teen moms who bottle-feed can be pushed aside as the significant person in their babys life by well-meaning in-laws or mothers who really dont think that mom can handle the baby alone.Additional information@KellyMomHow breastfeeding makes life easier for momDaily Dietary Reference Intakes for TeensLesson plans and infomation on working with teens Benefits of Breastfeeding  Class for Teens @KellyMomLesson plan: Teen breastfeeding  Starting Out Right from the Texas Department of Health WICBetter Breastfeeding: A Guide for Teen Parents (clips from video)Promoting Breastfeeding in Teen Moms by Lily L.

The posting of outside articles on the website (or Facebook, Twitter, etc.) should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the position taken in the article.

KellyMom is in no way responsible or liable for anything posted by others.A note about research studies: We frequently post information here on scientific research regarding infant feeding and parenting. Research is a process  there is rarely a final definitive answer, and we incorporate new information into our understanding of an issue as it emerges.A scientific study is not a judgment on you  each study is simply a search for another piece of the puzzle.Research studies do not predict anything at all about any particular baby or babies  they look at trends in a large population. If your personal experience was not the same as the trend in a study, it does not mean that the research is invalid. Also, keep in mind that statements like less likely or less severe are not the same as does not happen at all. For example, when we look at large groups of babies, the babies who were breastfed have more positive health outcomes, however breastfeeding is NOT a guarantee of good health. About the only thing we can likely say about a particular breastfed baby is that their health is likely better than if s/he had received less breastmilk.Information is provided for educational purposes only.

Please feel free to do this, as long as your comment is respectful of opposing viewpoints. Please remember that KellyMom does not have any control over who posts comments or whether the majority of people posting comments have different opinions than your own.Keep it Kind. This community is dedicated to supporting parents, not debating parenting decisions. We believe that sharing your observations and opinions about a subject is appropriate in a topical discussion. You can do this in a way that is civil and promotes the overall feeling of safety, comfort, and support we value at KellyMom.You are communicating with REAL people. We encourage you to remember that this type of communication strips all nuance from a message because the reader is not privy to your tone of voice or body language. Misunderstandings can easily happen when we are working with just the written word and no other social cues (especially in an international community such as ours). Please be especially mindful of this while commenting and reading. Its easy for readers to infuse a message with a sentiment that wasnt there on the part of the writer because each post is an emotional blank slate in many ways.When communicating with our computers its easy to lose sight of the fact that you are interacting with REAL people (who have real feelings) . It can be really easy to relax our hold on civil conversation in the heat of the moment and hard to make up for it afterward. So, try to be kind, polite, and calm even when disagreeing! Keep those real people in mind each time you post.It is NOT OK to attack other commenters. Strong opinions and lively exchanges are possible with topics related to parenting. Insults, flaming, name calling, disrespect and attacks are not appropriate and will not be tolerated within our community. If you choose to use the term Breastfeeding Nazi (or similar phrases) in a comment, be aware that there is a 99% chance your comment will be removed. All personal attacks will be deleted, even if you preface them by saying this is not meant to offend anyone (it DOES), or I support breastfeeding, but.KellyMom supports ALL parents. How long to breastfeed is a decision that will vary due to many factors, and we support parents here whose children wean both before and long after the first 12 months.Some parent/infant dyads have issues that prevent meeting their breastfeeding goals (or current recommendations on breastfeeding duration), and we support them in providing the best nutrition available for their child (which may well include infant formula). Comments like infant formula is poison/nasty/etc. will be deletedthe use of infant formula is sometimes necessary, and it remains the best choice when human milk is not available. Do not comment on another parents reasons for giving their child formula  you have not walked in theirshoes, and it is not your place to decide whether they tried hard enough.Finally, we also support parents who nurse long past infancy here breastfeeding past infancy is normal and beneficial to both motherand child, and we absolutely support breastfeeding until the CHILD is ready to wean (whether thats at 2 or 7!). The American Academy of Pediatrics notes in their breastfeeding policy statement that Increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and the mother There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychologic or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer (AAP 2005. More here).Please keep your comments specific to the posted article. Off-topic comments may be considered a derail of the conversation and as such are subject to deletion.DEBATE will not be hosted. Do not engage another commenter and begin an exchange. Weve chosen not to host debate because we do moderate the spaces within KellyMom.com and hosting debate is too energy intensive.

Do you use a nursing cover?,http://kellymom.com/blog-post/do-you-use-a-nursing-cover/,"I have mixed feelings about nursing covers.

Our experience with attachment parenting,http://kellymom.com/parenting/our-experience/,". the text of this essay was                last modified when our middle child,  Alex, was 13 months                old.Im Jordans mom and Alexanders                mom, and their dad and I found out                that our style of parenting is called                attachment parenting.Attachment parenting is a nurturing,                responsive style of parenting that                respects the individual needs of                your child. It takes many forms;                each family will do what feels right                for their situation. Some nice descriptions                of attachment parenting:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.There                  is No Doctrine for Attachment Parenting:                  Being AP is a Frame of Mind! by Diana West, IBCLCWhat Attachment Parenting IsThe                  7 Baby Bs by William Sears,                  MDJordan was exclusively breastfed                until she was 6 months old, and she                will wean herself when she is ready                for it  the same will hold for Alexander.                Right now, Alex and Jordan are tandem                 nursing. Jordan received most                of her nutrition from nursing until                she was around 18-20 months old.                She was eating solids throughout                that time (insisting on feeding herself                from 9-10 months) but just not that                much. Alex, at 13 months, enjoys                his solids more than Jordan did,                but is still eating relatively few                at this point. As long as my child                is nursing very regularly, I dont                have to worry about him getting enough                nutrition.Breastfeeding is not only about                nutrition  Jordan and Alex get tons                of health                and emotional benefits from nursing,                too. Jordan and Alex were only sick                a couple of times during their first                12 months, and the illnesses were                very minor. At the time that Im                writing this (Jordan is 4 1/2 and                Alex is 13 months) neither have had                a sick visit to the doctor. Nursing                is also very soothing, and can be                a wonderful comfort to an upset or                hurt or angry child.Ive sometimes heard that bottle-feeding                is  supposed to be easier, but I                dont see how. I tried to boil a                bottle nipple once and melted it!                Weve never had to get up at night                (or during the day, for that matter)                to prepare a bottle, my children                have never had to wait for a bottle                to be prepared when they were hungry,                weve never needed to deal with carrying                formula and all the assorted paraphernalia                when we go out, and weve certainly                saved huge amounts of  money, both by both nursing and                not buying formula.Jordan has had a boppy nursing pillow                since she was very young. At around                13 months, when                she wanted to nurse, she would often                say boppy and either point                to it or bring it to me. Alex is                now 13 months (time flies!) and he                loves to bring the boppy to me to                nurse. He gets it and starts giggling                as he brings it to me  sometimes                he brings two (he really thinks thats                funny).We have a family                bed. Before Jordan was born,                we picked out a beautiful crib, but                after she was born Jordan wanted                to sleep on me  not in the crib,                so we never used the crib (we eventually                sold it). Before Alex was born, the                main piece of baby equipment that                we bought was a king sized bed! Having                our children sleep with us has worked                very well for our family. We very                rarely lose sleep due to a fussing                baby (like everyone told us we would).                Alex (and previously Jordan) stirs                and almost wakes up when he needs                to nurse, but since he is right beside                me I am able to nurse or soothe him                back to sleep before he fully wakes                up. Daddy has been wakened by babies                at night only a couple of times.                And its so wonderful to wake up                next to a smiling babyJordan and I have been very attached                since the beginning, and she has                always needed to be very close to                us (although shes now very independent                most of the time). Alex and I are                also very attached, and hes had                the same needs for closeness that                Jordan did. We hold him, or wear                him in a sling (I also used a front pack with Jordan),                whenever he needs the contact  even                if he needs it all day long. Of course,                hes so busy nowadays that he spends                most of his time exploring and running                after his sister!Jordan and Alex also go everywhere                with us  a nursing baby is incredibly                portable (just grab a diaper or two                and go), and we really enjoy having                them with us.When Jordan was 6 weeks old (and                I was still on maternity leave) I                decided to stay home with her since                I dont think that anyone else can                give her the constant attention and                quality of care that she deserves.                So Ive been a stay-at-home mom now                for over four years, and Im enjoying                every minute.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding your newborn — what to expect in the early weeks,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/newborn-nursing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage credit: jcgoforth on flickrThe First WeekHow often should baby be nursing?Frequent nursing encourages good milk supply and reduces engorgement. Aim for nursing at least 10  12 times per day (24 hours). You CANT nurse too oftenyou CAN nurse too little.Nurse at the first signs of hunger (stirring, rooting, hands in mouth)dont wait until baby is crying. Allow baby unlimited time at the breast when sucking actively, then offer the second breast. Some newborns are excessively sleepy at firstwake baby to nurse if 2 hours (during the day) or 4 hours (at night) have passed without nursing.Is baby getting enough milk?Weight gain: Normal newborns may lose up to 7% of birth weight in the first few days. After moms milk comes in, the average breastfed baby gains 6 oz/week (170 g/week). Take baby for a weight check at the end of the first week or beginning of the second week. Consult with babys doctor and your lactation consultant if baby is not gaining as expected.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Dirty diapers: In the early days, baby typically has one dirty diaper for each day of life (1 on day one, 2 on day two). After day 4, stools should be yellow and baby should have at least 3-4 stools daily that are the size of a US quarter (2.5 cm) or larger. Some babies stool every time they nurse, or even more oftenthis is normal, too. The normal stool of a breastfed baby is loose (soft to runny) and may be seedy or curdy.Wet diapers: In the early days, baby typically has one wet diaper for each day of life (1 on day one, 2 on day two). Once moms milk comes in, expect 5-6+ wet diapers every 24 hours. To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of water into a clean diaper. A piece of tissue in a disposable diaper will help you determine if the diaper is wet.Breast changesYour milk should start to come in (increase in quantity and change from colostrum to mature milk) between days 2 and 5. To minimize engorgement: nurse often, dont skip feedings (even at night), ensure good latch/positioning, and let baby finish the first breast before offering the other side. To decrease discomfort from engorgement, use cold and/or cabbage leaf compresses between feedings. If baby is having trouble latching due to engorgement, use reverse pressure softening or express milk until the nipple is soft, then try latching again.Call your doctor, midwife and/or lactation consultant if:Baby is having no wet or dirty diapersBaby has dark colored urine after day 3(should be pale yellow to clear)Baby has dark colored stools after day 4(should be mustard yellow, with no meconium)Baby has fewer wet/soiled diapers or nurses less frequently than the goals listed hereMom has symptoms of mastitis(sore breast with fever, chills, flu-like aching)Weeks two through sixHow often should baby be nursing?Frequent nursing in the early weeks is important for establishing a good milk supply. Most newborns need to nurse 8  12+ times per day (24 hours). You CANT nurse too oftenyou CAN nurse too little.Nurse at the first signs of hunger (stirring, rooting, hands in mouth)dont wait until baby is crying. Allow baby unlimited time at the breast when sucking actively, then offer the second breast. Some newborns are excessively sleepywake baby to nurse if 2 hours (during the day) or 4 hours (at night) have passed without nursing. Once baby has established a good weight gain pattern, you can stop waking baby and nurse on babys cues alone.The following things are normal:Frequent and/or long feedings.Varying nursing pattern from day to day.Cluster nursing (very frequent to constant nursing) for several hoursusually eveningseach day. This may coincide with the normal fussy time that most babies have in the early months.Growth spurts, where baby nurses more often than usual for several days and may act very fussy. Common growth spurt times in the early weeks are the first few days at home, 7  10 days, 2  3 weeks and 4  6 weeks.Is baby getting enough milk?Weight gain: The average breastfed newborn gains 6 ounces/week (170 grams/week). Consult with babys doctor and your lactation consultant if baby is not gaining as expected.Dirty diapers: Expect 3-4+ stools daily that are the size of a US quarter (2.5 cm) or larger. Some babies stool every time they nurse, or even more oftenthis is normal, too. The normal stool of a breastfed baby is yellow and loose (soft to runny) and may be seedy or curdy. After 4  6 weeks, some babies stool less frequently, with stools as infrequent as one every 7-10 days. As long as baby is gaining well, this is normal.Wet diapers: Expect 5-6+ wet diapers every 24 hours. To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of water into a clean diaper. A piece of tissue in a disposable diaper will help you determine if the diaper is wet. After 6 weeks, wet diapers may drop to 4-5/day but amount of urine will increase to 4-6+ tablespoons (60-90+ mL) as babys bladder capacity grows.Milk supply?Some moms worry about milk supply. As long as baby is gaining well on moms milk alone, then milk supply is good. Between weight checks, a sufficient number of wet and dirty diapers will indicate that baby is getting enough milk.This information is also found as part of the professional Breastfeeding Logs.Additional information@ Breastfeeding LogsHunger Cues  When do I feed baby?Resources: Is Baby Getting Enough Milk?Normal Growth of Breastfed BabiesBreastfeeding BasicsInformation is Your Ally in preparing to breastfeed: 10 Tips for Success by Eva LyfordTips for juggling a newborn and toddlerFrequent NursingWorried about milk supply?How does milk production work?Is your milk supply really low?My breasts feel empty!

Frequent nursing,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/frequent-nursing/,"Image credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrBoth of my children seemed to spend the first 6 weeks or so in a constant growth spurt. If your child is doing the same, then hang in there things almost always start to calm down somewherebetween 6 and 8 weeks. With my second I figured that the early weeks would be easier since we already had one child, but I quickly found out that this just isnt the case. We were still adjusting to a change in family size (and theolderchild is having to adjust too not just two adults), and our new baby was having to adjust to life outside of mom. After years oftalking to mothers with new babies, Ive discovered that the first 6-8 weeks with a new baby tends to be a combination of magic, exhaustion, and stress for any family  no matter how many children you have.Tips for coping with frequent nursingFirst of all, do know that frequent nursing is normal and expected in the early months  most newborns need to nurse at least 8  12 times per day. Frequent nursing is also needed  to avoid/reduce engorgement in the early days, to nourish and grow a baby who has a stomach the size of his fist but who needs to double his weight within 5-6 months, to establish a good milk supply for mom, and to help a baby who has been cradled close and warm inside mom for 9 months adjust to life in the outside world. Frequent nursing may sometimes be a warning sign of inefficient milk transfer or low milk supply, but if baby has good diaper output, is gaining well and is generally happy and healthy, then the frequent nursing is unlikely to be a sign of a problem.Remember that nursing is not just about food  its also warmth, closeness, reassurance, comfort, healing, love Nursing has been shown to reduce stress and pain in baby, too. If youre feeling that baby shouldnt be hungry again so soon  remember that its sometimes Mom that baby needs just as much as the milk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Fine-tune breastfeedingIf baby seems to be nursing all the time, you first want to make sure that breastfeeding is working well. Problems with latching can result in frequent nursing if baby is not transferring milk efficiently. If babys latch is shallow, it can be like when youre drinking from a straw and pinch the straw mostly shut  baby is still getting milk but it takes a loooong time at the breast to get enough. Often, even minor changes in latch can help a lot. Heres more on latching. If you feel that breastfeeding is not working as well as it should, do your best to get some local help  evaluating and fixing latch problems over the phone or online is difficult. Using breast massage and breast compression can also be helpful at times for babies who are frequent nursers.Adjust your expectationsIn the early weeks of breastfeeding, it really helped me to plan my day with the expectation that I would be nursing most of the time. Once I considered frequent nursing to be the norm rather than a problem, it made my life much easier.Many books, magazine articles, friends and other products of our modern culture suggest to us that we will be able to go on with life as usual after baby is born  that we can and should train baby to conform to an adult routine. But our lives do change greatly with the birth of a new baby, and urging baby to conform to our pre-baby routines can come at great cost to both baby and parents. Routinely delaying nursing when baby cues a need to eat can harm milk supply, affect babys weight gain, and is very stressful to both mom and baby. It is developmentally appropriate for young babies to nurse frequently. By letting baby stretch out nursing frequency on his own (and it will happen with time)  you are preserving your nursing relationship and meeting babys physical and emotional needs.The first 6-8 weeks are a time when you are building your milk supply and you and baby are getting used to each other and learning about nursing. After the first 6-12 weeks, most babies are much more settled and move toward a more predictable routine. Nursing sessions do not take as much time, either, as baby becomes more efficient at nursing. Nursing will not always take this much time  soon nursing will be much quicker and easier, and you will have gotten past boot camp to the easy phase of nursing.Set prioritiesWill the dishes be unhappy and depressed if you neglect them for a few months? Youre growing and building a relationship with your children  the dishes and housework can wait when your child needs time and attention.Make a list of the things youd like to get done each week, and prioritize them. For the things that absolutely need to get done, see if you can find shortcuts and/or someone else who can do the job. In the early weeks, if a friend or family member asks if they can help, take them up on it  see if someone can put a load of clothes on, or wash the dishes, or vacuum the floor while you nurse baby. Some families decide that its worth the money to get a cleaning service to come in every couple of weeks to do the heavy cleaning. Can an older neighborhood child or a friend come over to entertain your older children while you nap with baby? Can Dad make sandwiches or cut up vegetables/fruit so you have food easily available when baby is nursing often? Be creative, and dont be afraid to let the smaller things slide. Youll have plenty of time for them later  the in arms phase of babys life is so short, even though it might feel like forever when youre in the middle of it.Be preparedPut together a collection of items that you might need while youre nursing. If you usually nurse in one particular place, you might set up a nursing area there, or if you move around you can keep your collection in a basket or other container with a handle. Some things you might want:a few diapers & wipesextra cloth diapers or burp ragswater bottlesnacksbooksany remote controls you might want to usecordless phone (or make sure your answering machine is turned on)Do you have a baby carrier? Are you comfortable with using it and nursing baby in it? A carrier will give you an extra hand (sometimes two) and allow you to keep nursing or holding baby while walking around doing other things.Maximize sleepNap when baby naps. Youve probably heard it a million times, but we say it because it helps! When baby goes to sleep, dont jump up to do housework  lie down and rest and try to go to sleep. If you cant sleep, then read a book, listen to music, watch a movie but dont run around the house. If you get some sleep now, youll have more energy to do what you need to do later.Consider sleeping with or nearby baby so you can get more sleep. Co-sleeping (for naps, and/or during the night) is a lifesaver for many nursing moms. The closer you are to your baby, the less your sleep will be interrupted for night waking. Here are some tips on side lying nursing, and information on safely sleeping with your baby. Getting more rest can make life with baby much easier.Do you feel trapped at home?Many new moms feel like theyre trapped at home with a frequently nursing baby, but most young babies are incredibly easy to take out and about. It can really help to get out occasionally. Here are some tips for going out:Get a baby carrier . With a carrier (and a little practice) you can nurse your baby while you walk around the park or the mall.Put baby in a baby carrier or a stroller, and go for a walk.Go to a movie. Most young babies simply sleep and nurse through movies. And if youre nervous about nursing in public, a dark movie theater can be a good place to start. Go here for commentary and tips on nursing in public.If you want to go out by yourself for a bit, you dont have to leave a bottle. If your baby normally goes an hour or two between nursing sessions, then nurse baby right before you leave and plan to be back before the next nursing session. If you have a cell phone, take it with you so Dad or another caregiver can call you if the going gets rough. Even if you can only expect 20-30 minutes between nursings, go for a walk by yourself while someone watches baby. Every little bit helps, when youre feeling touched out..Additional ResourcesNursing your newborn  what to expect in the early weeksGrowth SpurtsCluster Feeding and Fussy EveningsNursing to sleep and other comfort nursingIm worried about spoiling my babyWhat should I know about giving my breastfed baby a pacifier?My baby is fussy!

Growth spurts,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/growth-spurts/,"duron12345 - Fotolia.comMost babies go through several growth spurts (also called frequency days) during the first 12 months.What is a growth spurt?During a growth spurt, breastfed babies nurse more often than usual (sometimes as often as every hour) and often act fussier than usual.The increase in babys milk intake during growth spurts is temporary. In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months. As solids are gradually introduced after six months, babys milk intake will gradually decrease.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Physical growth is not the only reason that babies may have a temporary need for increased nursing. Babies often exhibit the same type of behavior (increased nursing with or without increased fussiness) when they are working on developmental advances such as rolling over, crawling, walking or talking. Moms milk is for growing the brain as well as the body!When do babies have growth spurts?Common times for growth spurts are during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). Babies dont read calendars, however, so your baby may do things differently.Growth spurts dont stop after the first year  most moms notice growth spurts every few months during the toddler years and periodically thereafter on through the teenage years.How long do growth spurts last?Growth spurts usually last 2-3 days, but sometimes last a week or so.What is the best way to handle a growth spurt?Follow your childs lead. Baby will automatically get more milk by nursing more frequently, and your milk supply will increase due to the increased nursing. It is not necessary (or advised) to supplement your baby with formula or expressed milk during a growth spurt. Supplementing (and/or scheduling feeds) interferes with the natural supply and demand of milk production and will prevent your body from getting the message to make more milk during the growth spurt.Some nursing moms feel more hungry or thirsty when baby is going through a growth spurt. Listen to your body  you may need to eat or drink more during the time that baby is nursing more often.See My baby is fussy!

Sore nipples or breasts? Here’s help…,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/sore-nipples-breasts/,"Is nipple pain normal in the early weeks?Some mothers never experience any nipple pain at all, but studies show that the majority of women in the US and other western countries do have some nipple pain in the beginning. How do we tell the difference between this typical nipple pain and a problem that would benefit from the help of an experienced breastfeeding counselor and/or IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant)?Typical nipple pain (transient soreness) that does not usually indicate a problem:Latch-on pain that lasts no more than 30 seconds into the feeding. This is often described as mild pain or discomfort, but since the pain sensation is very subjective every mother experiences pain differentlysome mothers feel more severe pain. The pain should not continue through the entire feeding, and there should not be pain between feedings.Pain usually peaks around the third day after birth, and is gone within two weeks.There is no skin damage  no cracks, blisters, or bleeding.Your nipple should look the same before and immediately after the feeding  not flattened, creased or pinched.Get help froman experienced breastfeeding counselor and/or IBCLC if you experience the following:Intense, excruciating painPain thatcontinues through the entire feedingPain between feedingsPain that continues past the first couple of weeksSkin damagecracks, blisters, or bleedingIf youre experiencing any of the above issues, then dont let someone tell you that everything looks fine  it is either a sign that damage is being done or of some underlying condition (infection, etc.).If youre experiencing pain that makes you dread feeding your baby or that you describe as excruciating or if you have cracked or bleeding nipples, then this is NOT the norm and there is almost always something that can be done to address the issue and to alleviate the pain. Please do not assume this is normal and just suffer through it  ask for help! It doesnt mean youre doing something wrong  there can be many causes, from anatomical issues to infection. Cracking, bleeding or any other nipple damage is not normal  something is causing the damage and pain, and a good IBCLC can help you to find the cause. Seeing a knowledgeable breastfeeding professional could make all the difference.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Some things to investigate if you have nipple pain:Did breastfeeding get painful when your milk came in? Engorgement can make it difficult for baby to latch deeply. Reverse pressure softening or expressing a little milk can help baby get a deeper latch that does not hurt.Does your nipple look flattened, creased, or pinched when baby unlatches? Can you see a white line across the nipple when baby unlatches? This is usually the sign of a shallow latch. A shallow latch can usually be remedied by adjusting latching technique, but it can also be caused by anatomical variations in mom or baby.Do you have skin damage (bruising, cracks, blisters/blebs, bleeding)? While you investigate and address the cause of the damage, use these tipsHealing damaged skin in the nipple area.Some potential causes of nipple pain and damage include:shallow latch, babys lips tucked inward instead of flanged outward when breastfeeding, removing baby from the breast without first breaking the suction;unusual infant anatomy such astongue-tie or lip-tie, unusual palate shape, receding chin, short tongue;strong/unusualsuckling;jawclamping/clenching;unusual nipple anatomy such asinverted or flat nipples, very long, or large nipples.Do you have a rash on the nipple or areola? Contact dermatitis (from breast pads, nipple creams, soaps/detergents, etc.), eczema, psoriasis, poison ivy/oak can all be present on the nipple or breast and cause sore nipples.Are you using a breast pump? Incorrectly sized pump flanges, too-high suction settings, or too-slow cycling settings can cause nipple pain or damage.Are you experiencing pain between feedings (in addition to or instead of during feedings)? Investigate thrush (yeast infection)and nipple blanching (turning white) and vasospasm.Do you have a forceful milk ejection/let-down reflex? Some babies will clamp down on the nipple to slow the milk flow, causing pain.Has the pain started after weeks or months with no issues?

Engorgement typically begins on the 3rd to 5th day after birth, and subsides within 12-48 hours if properly treated (7-10 days without proper treatment).Read more about minimizing and treating engorgement here: Engorgement.See alsoEngorgementwhen tandem breastfeeding.Breast painFollowing are some things to investigate if you are experiencing breast pain.Engorgement(in addition to appearing during the first week, you may also experience engorgement if you skip a breastfeeding session or wait too long between breastfeeding sessions)Plugged Ducts and Mastitisare the most common causes of breast pain in breastfeeding mothers (other than engorgement).Breast pain is sometimes associated with aforceful milk ejection/let-down reflex and oversupply. This pain will appear when the milk lets down, soon after the feeding begins; it usually decreases over time and is gone within the first month after birth.Raynauds phenomenon/vasospasm can cause deep breast pain.Some breast pain might also be caused by a tightening of the chest muscles leading to a reduced blood flow to the breast and nipples. Edith Kernerman, IBCLC has hypothesized anddescribed this set of symptoms, calledmammary constriction syndrome (read more about it here), which is treated with pectoral muscle massage.Sometimes breast pain may be referred pain from nipple trauma or a muscle strain or injury.A badly fitting bra or tight straps on a baby carrier can cause shooting breast pains.Breastfeeding mothers may also experience premenstrual breast pain or fibrocystic breast pain.Have you had breast surgery or a breast injury in the past? Internal scarring can sometimes cause pain, as can a ruptured breast implant.Mothers with very large breasts sometimes experience muscle strain due to the weight of their breasts, which may be relieved with a well-fitting bra.Thrush (yeast infection)may cause breast pain along with other symptoms (shiny or flaky skin on the nipple/areola, nipple pain) but breast pain is unlikely to be the only symptom of thrush.More resources:Breast pain from La Leche League InternationalBerens P, et al.ABM Clinical Protocol #26: Persistent Pain with Breastfeeding.Breastfeed Med. 2016 Mar;11(2):46-53. doi: 10.1089/bfm.2016.29002.pjb.

Laws Concerning Food and Drink; Household Principles; Lamentations of the Father,http://kellymom.com/fun/wisdom/lament/,"by Ian Frazier                 (February 1997, The Atlantic Monthly)  Of the beasts of the field, and of the fishes of the sea, and                 of all foods that are acceptable in my sight you may eat, but not                 in the living room. Of the hoofed animals, broiled or ground into                 burgers, you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the cloven-hoofed                 animal, plain or with cheese, you may eat, but not in the living                 room. Of the cereal grains, of the corn and of the wheat and of                 the oats, and of all the cereals that are of bright color and unknown                 provenance you may eat, but not in the living room. Of the quiescently                 frozen dessert and of all frozen after-meal treats you may eat,                 but absolutely not in the living room. Of the juices and other beverages,                 yes, even of those in sippy-cups, you may drink, but not in the                 living room, neither may you carry such therein. Indeed, when you                 reach the place where the living room carpet begins, of any food                 or beverage there you may not eat, neither may you drink.  But if you are sick, and are lying down and watching something,                 then may you eat in the living room.  Laws When at Table And if you are seated at your high chair, or in a chair such as                 a greater person might use, keep your legs and feet below you as                 they were. Neither raise up your knees, nor place your feet upon                 the table, for that is an abomination, and worthy of rebuke. Drink                 your milk as it is given you, neither use on it any utensils, nor                 fork, nor knife, nor spoon, for that is not what they are for; if                 you will dip your blocks in the milk, and lick it off, you will                 be sent away. When you have drunk, let the empty cup then remain                 upon the table, and do not bite it upon its edge and by your teeth                 hold it to your face in order to make noises in it sounding like                 a duck, for you will be sent away. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. When you chew your food, keep your mouth closed until you have                 swallowed, and do not open it to show your brother or your sister                 what is within; I say to you, do not do so, even if your brother                 or sister has done the same to you. Eat your food only; do not eat                 that which is not food; neither seize the table between your jaws,                 nor use the raiment of the table to wipe your lips. I say again                 to you, do not touch it, but leave it as it is. And though your                 stick of carrot does indeed resemble a marker, do not draw with                 it upon the table, even in pretend, for we do not do that, that                 is why. And though the pieces of broccoli are very like small trees,                 do not stand them upright to make a forest, because we do not do                 that, that is why. Sit just as I have told you, and do not lean                 to one side or the other, nor slide down until you are nearly slid                 away. Heed me; for if you sit like that, your hair will go into                 the syrup. And now behold, even as I have said, it has come to pass.  Laws Pertaining to Dessert For we judge between the plate that is unclean and the plate that                 is clean, saying first, if the plate is clean, then you shall have                 dessert. But of the unclean plate, the laws are these: If you have                 eaten most of your meat, and two bites of your peas with each bite                 consisting of not less than three peas each, or in total six peas,                 eaten where I can see, and you have eaten enough of your potatoes                 to fill two forks, both forkfuls eaten where I can see, then you                 shall have dessert. But if you eat a lesser number of peas, and                 yet you eat the potatoes, still you shall not have dessert; and                 if you eat the peas, yet leave the potatoes uneaten, you shall not                 have dessert, no, not even a small portion thereof. And if you try                 to deceive by moving the potatoes or peas around with a fork, that                 it may appear you have eaten what you have not, you will fall into                 iniquity. And I will know, and you shall have no dessert.  On Screaming Do not scream; for it is as if you scream all the time. If you                 are given a plate on which two foods you do not wish to touch each                 other are touching each other, your voice rises up even to the ceiling,                 while you point to the offense with the finger of your right hand;                 but I say to you, scream not, only remonstrate gently with the server,                 that the server may correct the fault. Likewise if you receive a                 portion of fish from which every piece of herbal seasoning has not                 been scraped off, and the herbal seasoning is loathsome to you,                 and steeped in vileness, again I say, refrain from screaming. Though                 the vileness overwhelm you, and cause you a faint unto death, make                 not that sound from within your throat, neither cover your face,                 nor press your fingers to your nose. For even now I have made the                 fish as it should be; behold, I eat of it myself, yet do not die.  Concerning Face and HandsCast your countenance upward to the light, and lift your eyes to                 the hills, that I may more easily wash you off. For the stains are                 upon you; even to the very back of your head, there is rice thereon.                 And in the breast pocket of your garment, and upon the tie of your                 shoe, rice and other fragments are distributed in a manner wonderful                 to see. Only hold yourself still; hold still, I say. Give each finger                 in its turn for my examination thereof, and also each thumb. Lo,                 how iniquitous they appear. What I do is as it must be; and you                 shall not go hence until I have done.  Various Other Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances Bite not, lest you be cast into quiet time. Neither drink of your                 own bath water, nor of bath water of any kind; nor rub your feet                 on bread, even if it be in the package; nor rub yourself against                 cars, nor against any building; nor eat sand.  Leave the cat alone, for what has the cat done, that you should                 afflict it so with tape? And hum not that humming in your nose as                 I read, nor stand between the light and the book. Indeed, you will                 drive me to madness. Nor forget what I said about the tape.  Complaints and Lamentations O my children, you are disobedient. For when I tell you what you                 must do, you argue and dispute hotly even to the littlest detail;                 and when I do not accede, you cry out, and hit and kick. Yes, and                 even sometimes do you spit, and shout stupid-head and other blasphemies,                 and hit and kick the wall and the molding thereof when you are sent                 to the corner. And though the law teaches that no one shall be sent                 to the corner for more minutes than he has years of age, yet I would                 leave you there all day, so mighty am I in anger. But upon being                 sent to the corner you ask straightaway, Can I come out? and I                 reply, No, you may not come out. And again you ask, and again                 I give the same reply. But when you ask again a third time, then                 you may come out.  Hear me, O my children, for the bills they kill me. I pay and                 I pay again, even to the twelfth time in a year, and yet again they                 mount higher than before. For our health, that we may be covered,                 I give six hundred and twenty talents twelve times in a year; but                 even this covers not the fifteen hundred deductible for each member                 of the family within a calendar year. And yet for ordinary visits                 we still are not covered, nor for many medicines, nor for the teeth                 within our mouths. Guess not at what rage is in my mind, for surely                 you cannot know.  For I will come to you at the first of the month and at the fifteenth                 of the month with the bills and a great whining and moan. And when                 the month of taxes comes, I will decry the wrong and unfairness                 of it, and mourn with wine and ashtrays, and rend my receipts. And                 you shall remember that I am that I am; before, after, and until                 you are twenty-one. Hear me then, and avoid me in my wrath, O children                 of me.

Can Fam  Physician. 2010 Apr;56(4):341-343.Although heating or cooking food is the best way to inactivate food-borne  pathogens, improved standards and surveillance have reduced  the prevalence of contaminated foods at grocery stores. Therefore,  it is no longer necessary for pregnant women to avoid foods  like deli meats and soft cheeses (associated with Listeria); soft-cooked eggs (associated with Salmonella); or sushi  and sashimi. Regardless of whether seafood is raw or cooked,  pregnant women should choose low mercury seafood (eg, salmon  and shrimp) over higher mercury varieties (eg, fresh tuna).  Pregnant women should ensure that their food is obtained from  reputable establishments; stored, handled, and cooked  properly; and consumed within a couple of days of purchasing.Motherisk websiteFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Meet Our Sponsor: Milkies Milk Trays,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/meet-sponsor-milk-trays/,"Tobi Porter, Breastfeeding/Pumping Mom and Milkies Product MompreneurFirefighter, paramedic, mom and inventor, Tobi Porter, realized early on in her breastfeeding journey that pumping is not the same as breastfeeding! It can be a lonely journey at times and a sacrifice that only other breastfeeding and pumping moms can fully appreciate.When Tobi went back to work at the fire department she learned very quickly that work, with its uncontrollable environment, can become a huge obstacle in a breastfeeding moms journey. Sadly, obstacles like this can often result in many working women not reaching their breastfeeding goals. As a firefighter and paramedic, Tobi would work 24 hour shifts and be always on call for 911 emergencies thus pumping became the only means to ensure her daughter got the breastmilk she needed.Tobi learned early on that freezing her breast milk in traditional milk storage bags was not a viable option given her unique circumstances. She would pump and her husband ended up throwing away almost 10 ounces of milk for every 24 hour shift she worked when he followed the thawing guidelines for frozen breast milk. With her strenuous work on top of the dehydration firefighters face, she soon realized that she couldnt keep up with the amount of milk being wasted and almost gave up. Thats when Tobi put her mind to how she could eliminate all this wasted milk and thus the Milk Trays was born.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Milk Trays are a way for breastfeeding/pumping moms to freeze their expressed breast milk into single 1-ounce servings to ensure only the milk needed for that specific bottle are thawed. In addition, Milk Trays fit any size bottle, contain no added dyes or chemicals and include a clear lid so you can see when milk is frozen. And of course, Milk Trays are a re-usable, earthy-friendly product, eliminating the expense and waste associated with traditional milk storage bags. See for yourself and meet Tobi in this demonstration video!Milk Trays turned out to be a huge success and Tobi soon joined another momprenueur, Helen Anderson, to help develop and grow the Milkies line of breastfeeding products.

Meet our Sponsor: Milkies,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/meet-our-sponsor-milkies/,"Our sponsor for the month is MilkiesMeet Helen Anderson, Breastfeeding Advocate and Milkies Products Mompreneur!Nurse, Lactation Educator, Mom and inventor, Helen Anderson, has devoted much of her life to helping women reach their breastfeeding goals. She conceived the idea of the award-winning Milkies Milk-Saver after the birth of her son Henry. As an RN in a busy emergency room, Helen didnt have much time to pump but needed to store enough breast milk to cover her 12-hour shifts. She couldnt help but notice that every time she nursed, much of her precious milk leaked  soaking her pads, shirt, and even her baby! Recognizing this as a common problem for all breastfeeding women, Helen developed the Milk-Saver to safely and conveniently collect any milk leaked during the nursing session.The product was an instant success and she soon joined with parent company, Fairhaven Health, to develop a number of other helpful products to support breastfeeding women. Milkies has since added many new products and team members but maintains the original goal of helping moms meet their breastfeeding goals with real, practical solutions to the everyday challenges of breastfeeding, milk collection and storage. Every Milkies product is tested by real moms and must meet strict criteria for value, quality and durability. Helen and her team of parents work together to rethink the barriers mothers face and their innovative solutions rival any of the large corporations in the lactation products market.Helen and her team understand that problem-solving products are only part of the support breastfeeding moms need. Thats why Helen shares the latest research about breastfeeding and milk production on her blog and with moms via Facebook on Belly to Breast. In addition to product development and raising 3 busy children, Helen recently earned her Masters in Nursing Education to prepare to be the most effective educator and advocate for breastfeeding families.

Meet our Sponsor: Can Moms Get More Sleep By Freemie Feeding? plus… Freemie Cups In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU),http://kellymom.com/sponsors/can-moms-get-more-sleep-by-freemie-feeding/,"Our sponsor for the month is Freemie. Learn more about Freemies products here. By Dan Garbez, Freemie Co-InventorCan Moms Get More Sleep By Freemie Feeding?Freemie Feeding is a potentially time-saving technique that combines pumping one breast with a Freemie cup and nursing baby on the other breast simultaneously. For many moms, Freemie Feeding is one of the most compelling reasons to have Freemie cupsin their breastfeeding toolkit.Because there is no bottle protruding from moms chest while Freemie Feeding, the baby can be comfortably held around the softly curved shape of the Freemie cup and nursed, with less distractions from feeding. If this technique can be successfully employed just twice a day  for example, when first waking in the morning and at bedtime  the time saved by combining pumping and feeding might mean as much as an extra hour of sleep to mom on some days. When mom has a new baby in the house, that extra sleep is priceless!The patented rounded and more natural shape of the Freemie milk collection cupmakes it the ultimate tool for women who want to pump and nurse simultaneously. Though many women report to us that they may be able to pump and nurse very young newborns with the traditional bottles and horns, they also tell us that as babies get older the sharp and bulky shapes of those horns and bottles, with tubes conspicuously poking out, become a big distraction. Babies stop feeding and start playing, making the attempt counter-productive.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Freemie Cups In The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)Many NICU moms already realize that Freemie cups are great for use at the hospital. Moms can pump discreetly with Freemie cups at their babies bedside in a busy NICU full of other families and hospital staff, while touching or holding their babies. In most cases they can even hold their babies for some precious skin-to- skin time while pumping.NICU moms may also be hospitalized themselves, sick or recovering from a major surgery. They are often in pain, exhausted and stressed. For these moms, clutching onto traditional horns and bottles and pumping eight to ten times each day to initiate milk production is an overwhelming challenge. Many fail to get their milk in. The hands free Freemie cups can make a tremendous difference in these situations, allowing mothers to pump, even when sick or exhausted.But beyond the most basic struggle to pump with the hand held horns and bottles, we believe the Freemie Feeding technique will one day be a widespread practice in NICUs around the world as babies gain strength and are getting ready to go home. Many NICU moms whose babies are approaching discharge have become pump-dependent, and their babies are accustomed to bottle feeding. These moms may be in despair, worried they will not be able to breastfeed, and will be stuck with exclusive pumping.The challenge many of these moms face is that babies that have become accustomed to bottle feeding can be too impatient or frail to nurse. For these babies, it just takes too long to get the food to come out. They have gotten used to immediate results when they suck on the bottle. But by using a pump and one Freemie cup to stimulate a letdown of milk from one breast, for many women milk will also begin to leak from the other breast. If this pumping technique is used while cuddling baby in a nursing position at that breast, babies that have become accustomed to bottles may begin to learn where the food comes from, without having to expend too many precious calories or tiring before they get it. And as they begin to enjoy the feeding and bonding time with mom, it is our hope that moms can achieve an easier balance in their lives, with more breastfeeding and less pumping, so they can sustain breastfeeding longer.Most women give up breastfeeding early because pumping is so much work. Even though Freemie cups make pumping much easier than any other pumping system, pumping is still more work than breastfeeding. If we reduce the amount of work necessary to keep going, we are certain more women will breastfeed longer.Please Note: Use of the Freemie system with a hospitalized or otherwise compromised infant must be done under the supervision of a lactation or health care professional.Freemies For PreemiesThe Freemie cups were born in a neonatal intensive care unit in northern California, because my wife, a physician, was acutely focused on the potentially life-saving importance of her milk to our twins, who were nine weeks premature, and just over 3 pounds each. Stella struggled to train the babies to breastfeed after we brought them home, and spent more than a year dependent on the pump.Earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit the Women and Childrens Hospital of Da Nang, which is the NICU for a large area of central Viet Nam. The hospital is in the process of starting the first human milk bank in that country. I was in Da Nang to facilitate a sizeable donation of Freemie cups and our Equality manual pumps to the hospital. (Our Freemie Equality pump is the worlds only concealable breast pump that does not require electricity, and is especially useful where electricity may not always be available.) The donation to the hospital was coordinated by Alive & Thrive, a global nonprofit funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was a humbling experience to see such tiny and vulnerable infants in that NICU, half a world away, to know that we will be helping them, and to know that they are just the first of millions more in the developing world that we will help.Videos wanted!If you are a mom already using the Freemie Feeding technique and would like to provide us a photo or video so that we can share it and help other moms, please email us at media@freemie.com.How can the Freemie system improve your pumping routine?About Freemie: The Freemie system was created by my wife, Dr. Stella Dao and myself, after the premature birth of our twins. Dr. Dao is board certified in Emergency Medicine and practices in Northern California. Our twins, at just over three pounds each and in the NICU for six weeks, were too weak to nurse, so Stella was pump dependent. Her workplace and our family situation made clear that the tools needed to sustain breastfeeding in the modern world did not yet exist.We founded DAO Health with the goal to transform the global infant feeding culture, by altering the economics of breast milk production. We believe that families everywhere need tools adapted to the modern economy to help them to feed their babies a healthier diet. Producing breast milk while separated from baby, for working women, is a lot of extra work  and time is money. We believe we can increase breastfeeding rates by reducing the actual cost to produce breast milk  when accounting for moms time  below the cost of formula. We can do this by providing moms with the necessary tools to produce milk efficiently.We launched our Freemie family of products in late 2013 in the United States. Now, Freemie cups are already available in more than a dozen countries, and were picking up speed!

A Texas Photographer’s Public Breastfeeding Project,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/a-texas-photographers-public-breastfeeding-project/,"Text by Leilani RogersI have 4 children, ages 8 to 15. I breastfed them all, but it was a tough journey. Breastfeeding was very important to me, it just did not come easy. My first 2 babies were premature, and that presented some unique challenges. Advocating for my baby and myself did not come easily, being that I am a soft-spoken person and that I was quite anxious about the well being of my babies. So, I would show up at the NICU, pumped milk in hand, only to discover that they had already given my baby formula. This was not ok with me, but I had a hard time getting through to the nurses, and they had no problem making me feel like they knew what was best for my baby not me.By the time Id dealt with latch issues, plugged milk ducts, mastitis, thrush, not to mention reflux and dairy allergies, my supply began to suffer and I threw in the towel at 3 months with the first, and 6 months with the second. I went on to breastfeed my third child for 12 months and fourth for 18 months, but again the journey was peppered with latch issues, thrush and sensitivities.I finally sought the help of a lactation consultant and with that support was able to accomplish my breastfeeding goals. But I was never comfortable breastfeeding in public. That kind of support was not there. I was nervous about what other people would think of me, and if they would stare at me, or worse  if they would say something to me. So I just avoided the confrontation wherever possible. This of course meant arranging my schedule entirely around my babies.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Austin, TX (where I live) is considered a mother friendly city now, and TX law protects the public breastfeeding mother. Billboards are popping up all over, commercials can be seen on TV and heard on the radio supporting breastfeeding mothers. But 40% of mothers listed breastfeeding in public as their top worry about breastfeeding in the Lansinoh 2012 breastfeeding study. So I know now that the fears I had 8-15 years ago were not uncommon.We know the statistics: About 75% of mothers initiate breastfeeding, which is recommended by the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) for 6 months then with foods for a year. The WHO (World Health Organization) recommends breastfeeding until 2 years, because of decreased risk for obesity, diabetes, and more. But how can mothers meet these recommendations if they dont feel supported enough to breastfeed their babies outside of their homes or on demand?As a birth photographer, I am capturing mothers breastfeeding journeys from the very tender beginning. And Im constantly reminded of what an accomplishment it is. Because of that coupled my own (previous) inhibitions, Ive developed a passion for breastfeeding photography. I love preserving this beautiful and natural bond for mothers, and Ive seen that through exposure, society becomes more accepting of it and it becomes more normal in their eyes. Not only that, but other mothers see the images and feel a stronger sense of community and support.I started a public breastfeeding project on a whim in 2013, when it dawned on me that I could target specific situations where mothers felt uncomfortable nursing in public by photographing them in those situations. It was World Breastfeeding Week and I wanted to take advantage of the increased interest in breastfeeding to get my message out there. I ran a poll on my Facebook page asking What is the one place you feel the most uncomfortable NIP (nursing in public)? and used the answers to schedule my sessions. With about 10 moms in all, I set out to a local church, grocery store, the park, the pool, a mothers workplace and restaurant.The response to my images was mostly positive. The majority of people seemed to support and even applaud the project, but the minority (who tend to troll these types of conversations anyway) was very vocal and generated some intense conversations.Moms, dads, grandmothers and photographers all chimed in. Current mothers seemed to find courage in the photos. A few of them even emailed me, thanking me for sharing the project. They walked away from the conversations about these images with more confidence, and feeling empowered enough to not place so much importance on their societys misguided views about breasts.Grandmothers and older women generally felt the most strongly about using discretion/covering up. Photographers clearly loved the idea behind the project, as they were commenting on the photos, asking questions and even sharing the images on their pages. When I began noticing similar sessions pop up in my Facebook feed from photographers that I followed, it occurred to me to join forces and make this a worldwide effort.I felt inspired to make a few changes to the project this year. Ive brainstormed some new locations, but I also wanted the sessions to feel more inclusive all breastMILK feeding moms, as I like to call it. This includes working mothers who pump on the job, stay at home moms who pump and donate their extra milk to milk banks, as well as mothers whos only choices are to bottle feed, cup feed or tube-feed their breast milk to their babies. All of these mamas are essentially breastfeeding, and yet they dont always feel like they have a place IN the breastfeeding community.The biggest change of course is that I recruited about 60 photographers to participate in the now called Public Breastfeeding Awareness Project. Ive encouraged them to include a variety of cultures, backgrounds and ages of babies/children who breastfeed or breastmilk feed in their sessions, which have taken place all over the US as well as Ireland, Venezuela, Australia, Italy, the UK and Canada. The photographs have attracted national attention from news stations, newspapers, and several online news sources. I never imagined this would go viral. Many of my photographers are or have been breastfeeding mothers themselves. So its not just about the pictures, but also about an issue that resonates with us all personally.Because breastfeeding can be a challenge and because breastfeeding mamas do have so many hurdles to overcome, its a relationship worth celebrating. Thats the key, I feel, to understanding why a week or month must be dedicated to the simple  act (as some like to call it) of breastfeeding.I had a wheelchair bound mother participate in one of my sessions. She was in a terrible car accident after shed already signed up to both model for me, and be a photographer herself. Her breastfeeding relationship was cut short due to complications from a car accident, and she told me she didnt think she was a good fit for the project anymore. I told her to come anyway, if anything to honor the dedication she had to breastfeeding her now 21 month old for nearly 20 months. Something she worked hard for was now over and I understood, because of my own experiences, how hard that must have been for her. She deserved to be recognized just as all women who work hard to meet their breastfeeding goals deserve to be recognized, and applauded! Its been amazing to watch this project grow and touch so many different people. To hear words like campaign ,movement and initiative be associated with it reinforce my vision. I hope to continue to inspire more moms to feel more confident breastfeeding in public rather than hiding in restrooms, or worse, at home. Both by showing that breastfeeding happens in real life and by supporting it when we turn our head in the grocery store and see it happening right in front of us.This project will continue to grow, because we have some serious barriers to break down: a) that the female body is sexual, not functional b) that breastfeeding mothers are flaunting themselves in public unless they are cloaked and c) the great divide between mothers who have not had successful breastfeeding journeys and those that have. We must all work together, especially as a community of women. We stand in our own way (with regards to so many issues that affect us as women) when we allow our insecurities to get the best of us.To see more images from the Public Breastfeeding Awareness Project, search the hashtag #PBAP2015 on social media including facebook, twitter, instagram and pinterest.

What should I know about buying a new or used breastpump?,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/buying-a-used-or-new-pump/,"Image credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrClosed system vs. open system pumpsWhen you are buying a pump, whether it be new or used, it is important to know whether is has an open or a closed system. A closed system pump has a barrier between the milk collection kit and the pump mechanism to prevent contamination by bacteria/mold/viruses/etc. An open system pump has no such barrier.Note that it is NOT possible to completely sterilize the inside of an open system pump  you would have to dismantle the pump to get to all the parts that could be affected, plus some of these parts are impossible to completely sanitize. Buying new tubing, new parts, and cleaning every cleanable part does NOT sanitize the motor of the pump, which (in an open system pump) is, by definition, open to the new milk you are pumping.So far there have been no documented instances of a baby becoming ill due to contamination from a breastpump, but no one has studied the issue. Without any studies, its really hard to say what to do if you find signs of contamination in your pump  the potential for illness is there but we dont know how likely it is.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.CLOSED system pumps include:Ameda: Elite, Platinum, Purely YoursArdo: Calypso, CarumBailey: Nurture IIIFreemie: Freedom, EqualityHygeia: EnDeare, EnJoyeLansinoh: Signature Pro, Affinity ProLucina: Melodi OneMedela: Lactina, SymphonyPJs: Comfort, BlissRumble Tuff: Serene Express DuoSpectra: M1, S1, S2, Dew 350OPEN system pumps include:All Medela pumps EXCEPT Lactina/Symphony/other older hospital grade pumps.Contact your pump manufacturer if you are unsure whether your pump is open or closed system.Keep in mind that there is a difference between a closed system pump and a multiple user pump. Many closed system pumps are not designed to be used by more than one person  in fact, most pumps purchased by mothers are intended to be single-user pumps, and the manufacturer warranties and motor life will reflect that fact.If you are buying a used hospital-grade multiple user pump, make sure you check the serial number with the manufacturer before buying the pump.Its not unusual for pumps stolen fromhealth care facilities to show up for sale, and the manufacturers generally keep a list of serial numbers ofpumps that have been reported as stolen.Motor lifeAnother issue, particularly important in previously-used pumps, ismotor life. Check your warranty to get an idea of the expected life of your pump. Most breastpumps are designed for a year or so of typical use (15-20 pumping sessions per week). After that point the motor may not function as well, affecting the pumps milk output (and your milk supply).If you buy a used pump, the motor may already be near the end of its expected lifetime. Many pump rental stations will have a vacuum tester and can test your pump to see if the appropriate vacuum levels are being reached.WHO-Code ComplianceA third issue that is important to many parentsis whether the pump manufacturer is WHO-Code compliant. The WHO Code is a marketing code that aimsto protect breastfeeding and prevent aggressive marketing practicesthat oftenprevent parentsfrom meeting their own breastfeeding goals. Read more about the Codehereand find Code-compliant companies here.FAQsIf you find mold growing in your pump, is it safe to use the milk you have already pumped?Unfortunately, we have no studies on the subject to guide us. It may not be a major issue if you have an older healthy baby, and the pump has only been used by you (the babys mother). There would be more concerns about the safety of the milk if you have a preemie, newborn, or any baby with a compromised immune system. If the pump is an open system pump that has been used by more than one mother, there may be unknown contaminants present, so it would be difficult to determine the safety of using the milk.Can I recycle my old pump?Hygeia has a recycling program for their pumps. For other pump brands, call the manufacturer to ask if they have a recycling program in place. In addition, many communities have an electronics recycling service that you can take advantage of.How can I get help with the expense of a new pump?If you are in the US, check your insurance coverage!Certain pump rentals, purchases, and lactation counseling are 100% covered by health insurance if your plan year begins 8/1/2012 or later. If not covered by your insurance, breast pumps and supplies that assist lactation are (as of 2/28/11) considered a deductible medical expense.

Hypoplasia/Insufficient Glandular Tissue,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/supply-worries/insufficient-glandular-tissue/,"by Diana Cassar-Uhl, IBCLCUsed with permission.Maybe you just need to try a little harder.Have you tried fenugreek?Youre probably not drinking enough water.Mothers who struggle with milk production hear advice like this from well-meaning friends and family members (and sometimes, from breastfeeding supporters who should know better). While the vast majority of milk production problems can be remedied by addressing issues of breastfeeding management, there are some for whom making enough milk to sustain their babies is difficult or impossible. Called primary lactation failure, this condition occurs when a mothers body does not make an adequate amount of milk for her baby, even when everything else (including but not limited to: latch and positioning, breastfeeding frequency and exclusivity, mother and baby are kept together, babys oral anatomy is fine  no tongue tie, cleft palate) is in order. Primary lactation failure can be due to a variety of factors, including previous thoracic or breast surgery that severs critical nerves or ductwork; hormonal complications, such as those that accompany polycystic ovarian syndrome or thyroid abnormalities; and a condition in which mammary tissue simply did not develop during adolescence. Called tubular (or tuberous) breast deformity in the plastic surgery literature, hypoplasia of the mammary gland (also called insufficient glandular tissue or IGT) was previously thought to be a simple issue of cosmetics  corrections addressed the appearance of a womans breasts, with little regard for their function. However, as breastfeeding gains significance as an issue of public health, more mothers seek to nourish their babies in this manner, but little is known about what to do when breastfeeding doesnt work.Why dont some mothers make milk?Lactation failure can be classified into three categories: preglandular, glandular, and postglandular (Morton, 1994). A preglandular cause for low or no milk production is directly related to hormonal issues such as a retained placenta or postpartum thyroiditis. Postglandular causes of insufficient milk production are those things that happen after the baby is born that get breastfeeding off to a bad start, like a baby who cannot properly transfer milk at the breast (for whatever reason), or poor breastfeeding management, such as scheduled feeds, extended separation of mother and baby. Glandular causes for low or no milk production can include previous breast surgery, or hypoplasia/IGT. Often, glandular lactation failure is accompanied by one or more preglandular and postglandular factors. Understanding your own body and health, asking questions about any medications or behaviors your doctor recommends during your pre-conception time, and being at a healthy body mass index (BMI) before becoming pregnant can help normalize your hormones. Expert breastfeeding assistance from an IBCLC, as well as choosing a birth setting that is Baby-Friendly, can help you ensure that breastfeeding gets off to the best start possible.Do I have hypoplasia/IGT?Image credit: Lisa BarteeHypoplastic breasts may be small or large. It is breast shape, placement, and asymmetry that indicate hypoplasia  not necessarily size. Normal-sized breasts that are lacking glandular tissue may be made up of fatty tissue that will sufficiently fill a bra cup.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.In a study of 34 mothers by Huggins, Petok, & Mireles (2000), a correlation between the following physical characteristics and lower milk output was found:widely spaced breasts (breasts are more than 1.5 inches apart)breast asymmetry (one breast is significantly larger than the other)presence of stretch marks on the breasts, in absence of breast growth, either during puberty or in pregnancytubular breast shape (empty sac appearance)Additional characteristics that may indicate hypoplasia are:disproportionately large or bulbous areolaeabsence of breast changes in pregnancy, postpartum, or bothWhile a large percentage of mothers with IGT felt like their breasts were different or something was wrong during adolescence, it is usually not until pregnancy, when the booby fairy doesnt arrive and her breasts change little or not at all, or after she has given birth, when she does not produce enough milk for her baby, that a mother knows she has insufficient glandular tissue. An exception to this might be if she sought or received breast augmentation surgery earlier in her life. Perhaps her plastic surgeon referred to tuberous breast deformity or constricted breast, both terms used to describe hypoplasia/IGT in the plastic surgery field.It is important to consider that some mothers with the physical markers noted above have no trouble bringing in a full, normal supply of milk after giving birth. However, a prenatal breast assessment that reveals physical characteristics consistent with hypoplasia/IGT should prompt extra attention to getting breastfeeding off to the best start possible. As well, it can be especially foreboding if a mother does not notice any changes in her breasts during her pregnancy.Why did this happen to me? Why cant I make enough milk?Image Credit: Lisa BarteeIt cannot be stressed enough that, if lactation failure of a glandular nature is suspected, preglandular and postglandular factors are accounted for and properly ruled out. It can be frustrating for a mother who really does have hypoplasia/IGT to keep being asked have you tried X or Y, but each well-intentioned care provider who asks such questions seeks to rule out the causes for low milk production that are far more common (and for which there are often effective fixes). As a clinician, I prefer to ask mothers what measures have you tried, and what other possible causes for this have you explored? This approach shows respect for the mothers journey while also encouraging a full review of all of the factors that could contribute to the problem of insufficient milk production.There is evidence (Rudel, Fenton, Ackerman, Euling, & Makris, 2011) to support a theory that exposure to high levels of certain environmental contaminants, namely dioxin and other endocrine disruptors, while in utero (exposure to accumulated contaminants in your mothers body before youre born) can predispose a woman to have insufficient breast growth during adolescence and pregnancy, the two times in her life her breasts should be growing. In some cases, a girls breasts may grow during puberty, but perhaps that growth is asymmetrical (uneven) or the breasts are large and appear normal, but only fatty tissue developed, not glandular tissue. This could be the result of hormonal irregularities that occur with some endocrine conditions, such as PCOS or uncontrolled thyroid or insulin-related conditions (Marasco, Marmet, & Shell, 2000). Some mothers with hypoplasia/IGT report luteal phase defect, which is a cyclical occurrence of lower-than-normal progesterone, even in the presence of ovulation. It is characterized by post-ovulatory basal body temperatures that do not rise significantly and may also result in pre-menstrual spotting. These cases of endocrine irregularities are especially important to address, because the hormone issues that interrupted the development of glandular tissue may also be preventing what milk-making tissue is there from doing its job. Normalizing these hormonal irregularities can help to maximize the performance of the glandular tissue that is present; this is why certain medications and herbs may have the effect of boosting milk production. However, what works for one mother might not work for another; this area needs more research.What can I do now? I really wanted to breastfeed my baby.Image Credit: Lisa BarteeSome mothers, after taking measures to maximize their milk production, make peace with the situation quickly and find joy in bottle-feeding their babies with love and sensitivity. But, for the mother who envisioned breastfeeding as a vital part of her mothering experience, or the mother who is concerned with the risks of not providing human milk to her baby, the realization that her body isnt going to produce what her baby needs to thrive can be devastating. Fortunately, there are ways to preserve aspects of the breastfeeding relationship. Again, it is imperative that all other potential causes of breastfeeding difficulty are ruled out, because any measure a mother takes to maximize and augment her milk production will be less effective if there are other factors at play, such as poor breastfeeding management or an inability on the babys part to effectively transfer milk. It is also vital to connect with other breastfeeding mothers and become familiar with the behavior of a normal breastfed baby; mothers who make plenty of milk worry that their babies arent getting enough when theyre fussy, if they feed often, or arent long sleepers. These aspects of normal newborn behavior may be especially unsettling to a mother with IGT, but a good understanding of what normal looks and acts like can smooth the process of re-developing trust in her own instincts about what her baby needs.Photo credit: Nyssa RetterSome mothers with hypoplasia/IGT are able to offer all feedings at their breasts, regardless of how much milk their breasts actually make, using an at-breast supplementing tool. This tool consists of a small tube that is taped beside or under the mothers nipple; the tube is connected to a container that holds the supplement, which may be the mothers own pumped milk, milk from a donor, or formula. Other mothers find that they are able to breastfeed and provide most of what their babies need, perhaps with the support of galactagogue (milk-making) herbs or medications, and only need to offer supplements, either at the breast or via bottle, once or twice each day. Your baby might be happiest if you offer an ounce by bottle, then latch him on to your breast once the edge has been taken off his hunger, and let him finish at your breast. Some mothers with hypoplasia/IGT find that their babies need no additional donor milk or formula supplementation around the middle of the first year, when theyve shown readiness for some solid foods. One ounce of formula offers 20 calories; one ounce of mashed, ripe avocado provides 50 calories; banana and sweet potato each have 25 calories per ounce. Depending on your babys weight gain and supplementation needs, nutrient-dense foods may provide adequate nourishment alongside the milk you are able to produce. Your pediatrician can help you determine what is best for your baby.The important thing is that you allow yourself the freedom to mourn the loss of the breastfeeding relationship you thought you would have. In that process, identify what aspects of breastfeeding your baby you were most excited to experience, and seek out the help of an IBCLC with experience in supporting mothers with low milk production or IGT. Help your IBCLC help you  do you want to learn how to pump and bottle-feed as much milk as youre able to make? Does the at-breast supplementer that just came in the mail confuse you, and you need some help getting going with it? Maybe the idea of using milk donors appeals to you, but you want some more information before you move forward with that. Talk to your IBCLC about the lengths youre willing to go to, and your comfort level with your situation. If she knows what your goals are, she can help you design a care plan that will suit your needs and your lifestyle. With support, many mothers go on to achieve their goals and have successful, fulfilling breastfeeding experiences that are about much more than the ounces of milk they produce.ReferencesHuggins, K., Petok, E., & Mireles, O.

Mother-2-Mother Concerns: Reflux,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/m2m-reflux/,"Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.Many parents have never heard of reflux. Reflux, or GER (Gastroesophageal reflux) is a condition where irritating stomach acids are regurgitated into the esophagus, causing pain similar to adult heartburn. It usually occurs more when the baby is lying flat, and is often marked by frequent and/or excessive spitting up. It can be a hidden cause of colicky and night waking babies.Babies that experience frequent (and often forceful) spitting up, obvious tummy pain day & night, marked fussiness after nursing (drawing up legs, knees to chest), arching or writhing as if in pain, extreme fussiness and crying may be experiencing reflux. A baby may experience all, or only some of the above symptoms. It is important to talk to your health care provider if you suspect your baby may have reflux, and to eliminate other issues which may mock the symptoms of reflux, like oversupply and food sensitivity. Also remember that breastfeeding a baby with reflux is one of the best things you can do to help!FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Mother-2-Mother Concerns: Green Stools,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/m2m-green-stools/,"Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.The occasional green stool is not unusual in the breastfed baby. Consistently green stools, however, are not normal for the breastfed baby. Most doctors dont seem to recognize this as a potential problem because they often define normal stool as that of the formula-fed infant. Babys stool can be a wide variety of colors and textures , and not all of these are cause for concern. It is helpful to know what is normal for the bf baby as well.Consistently green stools in the breastfed baby can indicate:an imbalance of foremilk/hindmilk, often resulting in frothy green stools.a sensitivity to something in the mothers diet, such as cows milk products.a sign that baby has an illness. Babies with an intestinal virus or even a simple cold will sometimes have green, mucusy stools. Teething can also bring about green stools due to increased saliva (can also cause tummy upset)a lot of green vegetables or something with green food coloring in moms diet.If baby has started solids, that could also account for the change in color (this is normal with the change in diet).FacebookPinterestTwitter"
What to Expect When Pumping,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/what-to-expect-when-pumping/,"Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.The very thought of pumping breastmilk can cause concern for the new mother. Questions like what kind of pump, when, where, and how much to pump are primary concerns, followed by concerns about the milk looking funny, storage issues and how much expressed breastmilk is needed per bottle. The answers to these concerns will vary for both individual mothers and babies depending on their individual needs and circumstances.The type/brand of pump you choose depends on whether you will be pumping frequently, or only occasionally. It is important to purchase a good quality pump, because poor quality pumps can result in poor performance of pump, and breast soreness. A breast pump is a personal product, and manufacturers do not recommend purchasing a used breast pump. Know the risks involved if you are considering a used pump.Check with your doctor and insurance company to see if your pump and other breastfeeding supplies can be covered by your health insurance. Many times with a doctors prescription, insurance companies will pay for a breastpump. This is especially true for mothers of premature or babies that are sick and need special care.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.How much you pump depends on individual needs. If you are returning to work your needs for the type/brand of pump and the amount you pump may be very different than if you are pumping occasionally. NOTE: Keep in mind that the average mom who is pumping between breastfeeding sessions can express between ONE and THREE oz per pumping session (not per breast, per session).Mothers who have spent a lot of time pumping, especially those who have pumped exclusively for long periods, have noted that as you pump, milk will flow and then stop, then flow & stop, then flow & stop, and so on & so on, and it can vary from person to person as to the individual pattern. These mothers recommend if you are trying to increase the amount you can pump, to pump for at least 15 minutes. (you might also continue pumping for 5 minutes after your milk stops flowing).Most moms need to pump at least 10 minutes, but no more than 20-30 minutes per session.Be sure that you are comfortable. Some moms use the  Pumpin Pal breastshield, which inserts into the shield of your regular pump and enables you to lean back while pumping. The idea is to be able to relax a little more. When you pump can make a difference in the amount you pump. It is quite normal for there to be a lower volume, or amount expressed in the late afternoon and evening hours as opposed to early morning hours. Most experts recommend, especially for the occasional pumper, to express their milk in the early morning hours, about an hour after nursing.NOTE: It cannot be stressed enough that the amount of milk you able to pump is NOT ever a reliable indicator of how much milk you are producing, nor how much milk baby is taking in. The healthy breastfed baby is usually much more efficient at getting milk from the breast than a pump is.More here on the amount of expressed milk needed by a baby.There are many good resources for information on storage and handling of expressed breastmilk. You can freeze your milk for use later, or you can pump and store milk in fridge one day to be used the following day, depending on your individual circumstances.Milk volume and appearance can and does change throughout the course of the breastfeeding relationship. In the early days after the birth of baby, the body has no idea how much milk to make, so often there is an abundance. After a few weeks, the body regulates and supply adjusts meet the needs of the baby, and the volume pumped may be reduced somewhat. Regular pumping will signal the body that there is increased demand, and the supply adjusts to meet these needs. It is normal for there to be a drop in the amount of milk pumped at about 3 months post partum due to a hormonal change. Adjusting pumping and nursing patterns can help compensate for this normal phase of the breastfeeding relationship. What does breastmilk look like? Breastmilk can be thin and watery looking, and may have a blue or yellow tint to it. It can even take on a hint of green, orange or other color if mother has been eating lots of green foods, or other colored foods, especially those with dye, such as green Gatorade. The color of the milk is usually not anything to be concerned about however its always good to check with a breastfeeding professional to be sure.It does not always look the same because breastmilk changes its composition throughout the feedings, as well as throughout the day. As baby grows, breastmilk continues to change to meet the needs for optimal growth, at each stage of babys development . This means that moms breastmilk at four months is perfectly suited to the needs of her four month old baby, and at six months, perfectly suited for her six month old.Expressed breastmilk will separate when stored in refrigerator. This can be a real shock to anyone who is not aware that this is normal. Sometimes there is a thick later of cream or fat on top, other times a thin layer. Sometimes the milk looks lumpy, or clumpy, and sometimes it can be nearly clear toward the bottom of the bottle. All of the above are completely normal occurrences, and does not mean the milk has spoiled. Spoiled milk has a distinct sour smell. The picture here shows an example of what normal breastmilk may look like.When ready to offer to the baby, one needs only to remove from fridge and gently swirl the milk in a gentle tornado-like fashion to remix it. Warm water run over the sides of the bottle will help when the thicker parts stick to the sides of the bottle.There can be many ups and downs for the pumping mother, but with patience, and persistence, most obstacles can be overcome. If any difficulties are encountered, its always a good idea to contact your local LLL, a board certified lactation consultant, or your local breastfeeding support group for information and/or assistance.Related Items from the KellyMom store:Sarah Wells stylish Kelly Breast Pump Bag in Black & WhiteUse code THNXMOMS for the special 10% off KellyMom SALE pricing!Working and Breastfeeding Made SimpleFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Tips for juggling a newborn and toddler,http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/tips-newborn-toddler/,"(not literally well, usually not literally!)First off, per a wise friend of mine who is a mom of five:               Be creative, patient, and hold tight to your sense of humor!What can I do to prepare my older child                 for a new baby?Before baby is born, it can help to talk with your older child about what newborns are like  what they look like, that they mainly nurse and sleep and cry, and how they need to be held much of the time.Tell stories about what your older child was like as a newborn and how you took care of him.Discuss things that your older child can do to help with baby: talk and sing to baby, get diapers and wipes, get mom her water bottle.Make opportunities for your children to see young babies and nursing babies (a La Leche League meeting can be a great place for this, especially if you dont know any nursing moms), and read books that show newborns and nursing babies.If your child has weaned or was never breastfed: Explain that mom makes milk for baby, that nursing is how baby eats, and that nursing also helps baby feel better when hes sad or scared or feeling bad.If your child is still nursing and you expect to tandem nurse: Talk to your child about how he and baby will both nurse after the baby is born. Point out that since baby cant eat other foods like your toddler can, he will need to nurse a lot. Look at pictures of tandem nursing siblings with your child. Heres more on tandem nursing.Should breastfeeding be hidden                 from your older child or other children?Absolutely not! Modeling nurturing behavior and breastfeeding to                 your children is one of the best things you can do for them.By seeing you nurse, your child is learning that breastfeeding                 is the normal, healthy way to feed a child rather than a shameful                 thing that needs to be hidden away. Breastfeeding is not something                 that should be hidden from children (or                 anyone else).Since most everyone in our culture equates babies with bottles,                 its not unusual for other children to be curious when you are breastfeeding                 your baby. If other children are curious when you are breastfeeding,                 simply tell them that you are nursing the baby and that nursing                 is how we feed babies. Again, you are teaching them by example that                 breastfeeding is the way to feed and nurture babies.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.General tipsCould you use a free hand when youre nursing? While youre nursing,                 a pillow can help bring baby to breast level so you have a hand                 or two free (sometimes it takes weeks or even months to get that                 free hand keep trying). If you need to support your breast with                 your other hand, try using a small rolled-up towel.A sling will also free up a hand or two. Are you comfortable with                 using a sling and nursing baby in it? In addition to nursing while                 youre lying down, this is another lifesaver for many moms. It frees                 at least one hand and allows you to keep nursing or holdingyour                 baby while tending to and playing with another child. Also, as someone                 I know once mentioned, when baby is in the sling your toddler cant                 be pulling babys toes, or trying to get baby out of the crib, or                 trying to brush babys teeth, or dropping toys on baby.It can be handy to have your toddler around, as many times you                 can ask them to fetch things for you (a diaper, a wipe, the remote,                 the phone, a water bottle). I dont know how many times I got settled                 on the couch with my first baby, then realized I was going to have                 to get up again to get something I forgot  the second time around                 I had a helper all day long, instead of only whenDad was home                 from work. She couldnt hold baby while I took a shower, but it                 sure did help with the little things.Activities to do with your older child                 while baby is nursingRead books and snuggle and talkwith your toddler while youre nursing.If youdont have a free hand, getyour toddler to hold a book and turn the pageswhile you read.Play games  I Spy and Simon Says are often a big hit with toddlers.Play with your food  try counting (and eating) cheerios or raisins with your toddler.Some toddlerslike to pretend-nurse their dolls or stuffed animals (or trucks!) while mom is nursing baby.Look at your toddlers baby book or baby pictures. Tell stories about when your toddler was a little baby. Tell stories about what your toddler can do now that he/she is bigger.You can also set your toddler up with other activities to do while                 youre nursing. Drawing, coloring, puzzles, blocks or big legos,cars/trains,                 etc. Some moms keep a box of toys that is out only when baby is                 nursing. We have a play kitchen that keeps my kids interested for                 a long time  they bring me food to eat and fix food for their dolls                 and stuffed animals and plastic dinosaurs, and have tea parties.                 Things like playdough and painting andwater play can keep                 kids interested for a long time, but depending upon where you can                 set it up and your child, this may or may not be something that                 works when youre nursing.If you need a nap and your toddler doesntChildproof aroom of the house that has:adoor or a baby gate (so your toddler cant escape and play in the toilet while youre resting)a bed or comfortable spot on the floor where you can lie down and nurseinteresting toys that your toddler is likely play with without much interaction  some moms also put on a favorite videoa snack and a drink for toddlerWhen you want to nap (or at least rest) while baby naps, close                 off the door so you can lie down with baby without worrying about                 what your toddler is getting into. A friend says she would lie on                 the floor with baby and let her toddlers use mom as a road for                 their matchbox cars  rest and a massage all rolled into one!What if your older child asks to nurse?Its pretty common for a toddler, or even an older child, to ask                 to nurse at some point after the new baby arrives. Many just want                 to know whether mom will say yes  they may also want to be held                 like a baby or babied in other ways. If given the opportunity                 to nurse, most children will simply touch or kiss the breast, giggle,                 and go play. Some moms prefer not to offer, but might offer breastmilk                 in a cup to taste, or simply distract the child with another activity.

Relactation and Adoptive Breastfeeding: The Basics,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/relactation/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage credit: ODHD on flickrRelactation or induced lactation (for those who did not give birth to their baby) is essentially a two-fold process:You will be teaching (or re-teaching) baby to nurse at the breast, and to equate nursing with comfort. If youre having problems getting baby to nurse, see Help  My Baby Wont Nurse!At the same time you will be developing (or re-developing) a milk supply. Developing a milk supply requires nipple stimulation (via baby nursing, hand expression, pumping or a combination) and milk removal (once there is milk to remove). If your baby will nurse, regular and frequent nursing sessions (even if baby is just learning in the beginning) will be very helpful.If your baby is 4 months old or younger it will generally be easier to relactate. It will also be easier if your milk supply was well established (frequent and effective nursing and/or pumping) during the first 4-6 weeks postpartum. However, moms with older babies, moms who did not establish a good milk supply in the beginning, and adoptive moms who have never breastfed can also get good results. Keep in mind that breastfeeding is not just about the milk. Your child will get numerous benefits from breastfeeding even if you do not have a full milk supply.If baby is willing to latch on, then nurse often (at least every 2-3 hours). Also, offer baby the breast for comfort any time you see a chance- at the end of a feeding when he is not hungry, when he is going to sleep and just waking up, and whenever he needs to comfort suck. Even if baby is not getting any milk at first, the nursing will be signaling your breasts to make milk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.What if baby will not latch? Keep working at it  some babies have gone back to the breast after many months of bottle feeding. Even if you are not able to persuade baby to latch, you have the option of re-establishing your milk supply via pumping and giving baby your milk via bottle or cup (this is called exclusive pumping).If baby is not nursing well (or not yet latching at all), pumping will make a big difference in increasing your milk supply. Even if baby appears to be nursing well, additional pumping will speed up the relactation process. See Establishing and maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing for more information.You will also want to take a look at Hidden Hindrances to a Healthy Milk Supply to see if there are any factors that may compromise your milk supply.Consider giving your baby his feedings via an alternative feeding method (rather than a bottle), such as a nursing supplementer, feeding syringe, finger feeding setup, flexible cup, spoon, medicine/eye dropper, etc. If your baby is latching well, a nursing supplementer can be a big help: it will encourage your baby to nurse at your breast by giving him a constant flow of milk (expressed milk and/or formula) while he stimulates your breasts to produce more milk. Some mothers use herbal supplements, such as fenugreek or blessed thistle, to stimulate milk production. You can usually buy these at health food stores or herb shops and occasionally at some large supermarkets or pharmacies. For more information see What is a galactagogue? Do I need one? Herbal remedies for increasing milk supply. There are also several prescription medications that increase milk supply. These herbal and pharmaceutical methods for stimulating milk supply will not be particularly effective unless combined with frequent nursing and/or pumping.Finally, get in touch with a breastfeeding counselor or Lactation Consultant/IBCLC(in person if at all possible) who has experience with relactation. Its great to have one-on-one support as you work through this.For addional information, see:Adoptive Breastfeeding & RelactationRelactation and Induced Lactation ResourcesFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Frequent nursing,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/frequent-nursing/,"Image credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrBoth of my children seemed to spend the first 6 weeks or so in a constant growth spurt. If your child is doing the same, then hang in there things almost always start to calm down somewherebetween 6 and 8 weeks. With my second I figured that the early weeks would be easier since we already had one child, but I quickly found out that this just isnt the case. We were still adjusting to a change in family size (and theolderchild is having to adjust too not just two adults), and our new baby was having to adjust to life outside of mom. After years oftalking to mothers with new babies, Ive discovered that the first 6-8 weeks with a new baby tends to be a combination of magic, exhaustion, and stress for any family  no matter how many children you have.Tips for coping with frequent nursingFirst of all, do know that frequent nursing is normal and expected in the early months  most newborns need to nurse at least 8  12 times per day. Frequent nursing is also needed  to avoid/reduce engorgement in the early days, to nourish and grow a baby who has a stomach the size of his fist but who needs to double his weight within 5-6 months, to establish a good milk supply for mom, and to help a baby who has been cradled close and warm inside mom for 9 months adjust to life in the outside world. Frequent nursing may sometimes be a warning sign of inefficient milk transfer or low milk supply, but if baby has good diaper output, is gaining well and is generally happy and healthy, then the frequent nursing is unlikely to be a sign of a problem.Remember that nursing is not just about food  its also warmth, closeness, reassurance, comfort, healing, love Nursing has been shown to reduce stress and pain in baby, too. If youre feeling that baby shouldnt be hungry again so soon  remember that its sometimes Mom that baby needs just as much as the milk.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Fine-tune breastfeedingIf baby seems to be nursing all the time, you first want to make sure that breastfeeding is working well. Problems with latching can result in frequent nursing if baby is not transferring milk efficiently. If babys latch is shallow, it can be like when youre drinking from a straw and pinch the straw mostly shut  baby is still getting milk but it takes a loooong time at the breast to get enough. Often, even minor changes in latch can help a lot. Heres more on latching. If you feel that breastfeeding is not working as well as it should, do your best to get some local help  evaluating and fixing latch problems over the phone or online is difficult. Using breast massage and breast compression can also be helpful at times for babies who are frequent nursers.Adjust your expectationsIn the early weeks of breastfeeding, it really helped me to plan my day with the expectation that I would be nursing most of the time. Once I considered frequent nursing to be the norm rather than a problem, it made my life much easier.Many books, magazine articles, friends and other products of our modern culture suggest to us that we will be able to go on with life as usual after baby is born  that we can and should train baby to conform to an adult routine. But our lives do change greatly with the birth of a new baby, and urging baby to conform to our pre-baby routines can come at great cost to both baby and parents. Routinely delaying nursing when baby cues a need to eat can harm milk supply, affect babys weight gain, and is very stressful to both mom and baby. It is developmentally appropriate for young babies to nurse frequently. By letting baby stretch out nursing frequency on his own (and it will happen with time)  you are preserving your nursing relationship and meeting babys physical and emotional needs.The first 6-8 weeks are a time when you are building your milk supply and you and baby are getting used to each other and learning about nursing. After the first 6-12 weeks, most babies are much more settled and move toward a more predictable routine. Nursing sessions do not take as much time, either, as baby becomes more efficient at nursing. Nursing will not always take this much time  soon nursing will be much quicker and easier, and you will have gotten past boot camp to the easy phase of nursing.Set prioritiesWill the dishes be unhappy and depressed if you neglect them for a few months? Youre growing and building a relationship with your children  the dishes and housework can wait when your child needs time and attention.Make a list of the things youd like to get done each week, and prioritize them. For the things that absolutely need to get done, see if you can find shortcuts and/or someone else who can do the job. In the early weeks, if a friend or family member asks if they can help, take them up on it  see if someone can put a load of clothes on, or wash the dishes, or vacuum the floor while you nurse baby. Some families decide that its worth the money to get a cleaning service to come in every couple of weeks to do the heavy cleaning. Can an older neighborhood child or a friend come over to entertain your older children while you nap with baby? Can Dad make sandwiches or cut up vegetables/fruit so you have food easily available when baby is nursing often? Be creative, and dont be afraid to let the smaller things slide. Youll have plenty of time for them later  the in arms phase of babys life is so short, even though it might feel like forever when youre in the middle of it.Be preparedPut together a collection of items that you might need while youre nursing. If you usually nurse in one particular place, you might set up a nursing area there, or if you move around you can keep your collection in a basket or other container with a handle. Some things you might want:a few diapers & wipesextra cloth diapers or burp ragswater bottlesnacksbooksany remote controls you might want to usecordless phone (or make sure your answering machine is turned on)Do you have a baby carrier? Are you comfortable with using it and nursing baby in it? A carrier will give you an extra hand (sometimes two) and allow you to keep nursing or holding baby while walking around doing other things.Maximize sleepNap when baby naps. Youve probably heard it a million times, but we say it because it helps! When baby goes to sleep, dont jump up to do housework  lie down and rest and try to go to sleep. If you cant sleep, then read a book, listen to music, watch a movie but dont run around the house. If you get some sleep now, youll have more energy to do what you need to do later.Consider sleeping with or nearby baby so you can get more sleep. Co-sleeping (for naps, and/or during the night) is a lifesaver for many nursing moms. The closer you are to your baby, the less your sleep will be interrupted for night waking. Here are some tips on side lying nursing, and information on safely sleeping with your baby. Getting more rest can make life with baby much easier.Do you feel trapped at home?Many new moms feel like theyre trapped at home with a frequently nursing baby, but most young babies are incredibly easy to take out and about. It can really help to get out occasionally. Here are some tips for going out:Get a baby carrier . With a carrier (and a little practice) you can nurse your baby while you walk around the park or the mall.Put baby in a baby carrier or a stroller, and go for a walk.Go to a movie. Most young babies simply sleep and nurse through movies. And if youre nervous about nursing in public, a dark movie theater can be a good place to start. Go here for commentary and tips on nursing in public.If you want to go out by yourself for a bit, you dont have to leave a bottle. If your baby normally goes an hour or two between nursing sessions, then nurse baby right before you leave and plan to be back before the next nursing session. If you have a cell phone, take it with you so Dad or another caregiver can call you if the going gets rough. Even if you can only expect 20-30 minutes between nursings, go for a walk by yourself while someone watches baby. Every little bit helps, when youre feeling touched out..Additional ResourcesNursing your newborn  what to expect in the early weeksGrowth SpurtsCluster Feeding and Fussy EveningsNursing to sleep and other comfort nursingIm worried about spoiling my babyWhat should I know about giving my breastfed baby a pacifier?My baby is fussy!

Let-down Reflex: Too slow?,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/supply-worries/letdown/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIs my let-down functioning properly?Possible causes of slow let-downLet-down as a conditioned reflexLet-down cues that have proven helpfulAdditional Information (links)Relaxation and Visualization Exercises (links) Is my let-down functioning properly?It is normal for let-down not to feel as strong as your baby gets older. Some mothers never feel let-down, and some stop feeling the let-down sensation as time goes by. This does not necessarily indicate that let-down is not taking place.Reliable signs of a healthy, functioning let-down include:In the first week or so, mother may notice uterine cramping during letdown.Baby changes his sucking pattern from short and choppy (like a pacifier suck) at the beginning of the feeding to more long, drawing, and rhythmic a minute or so into the feeding.Mother may have a feeling of calm, relaxation, sleepiness or drowsiness.Mother may have a strong sensation of thirst while breastfeeding.Baby is swallowing more often. A swallow sounds like a small puff of air coming out the babys nose and you can usually see the muscle moving in front of the babys ear, giving the baby the appearance of his earlobes subtly wiggling.Occasionally, mothers will also experience other symptoms during let-down, including itching, nausea, headaches, or negative emotions. Possible causes of slow let-downIts quite normal for a mother to have a harder time letting down when pumping than when nursing. The milk may be there, but you may have a hard time letting down and releasing the milk. Some mothers also have a let-down which is not functioning properly when baby is nursing.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Many things can be the cause of a slow or inhibited let-down: anxiety, pain, embarrassment, stress, cold, excessive caffeine use, smoking, use of alcohol, or the use of some medications. Mothers who have had breast surgery may have nerve damage that can interfere with let-down. In extreme situations of stress or crisis, the release of extra adrenaline in the mothers system (the fight or flight response) can reduce or block the hormones which affect let-down.Sometimes a cycle is created, where baby fusses and pulls off because the let-down is slow, which makes mom tense up, which makes the let-down even slower, etc. You can use relaxation techniques and let-down cues to break this cycle.Let-down as a conditioned reflexLet-down is partially a conditioned reflex, or one acquired as a result of repeated training. The pioneer of research into what he called conditioned reflexes was the Russian neurophysiologist Ivan Pavlov.A typical experiment of Pavlovs was as follows: On numerous occasions a bell is rung just before a dog is fed. The dog salivates as usual on receiving its food. Then the bell is rung without any food being presented. The dog salivates in response to the bell ringing.Lets put this in terms of nursing. Use a let-down cue just before you nurse (for example, deep breathing or drinking a cup of tea). Your milk then lets down in response to baby nursing. Once you have established a conditioned reflex, you will begin to let-down in response to the let-down cue, without baby needing to nurse (or nurse as long).In Pavlovs terms:the food (nursing) is an unconditioned stimulusthe salivation (let-down) in response to the food (nursing) is an unconditioned reflexthe sound of the bell (let-down cue) is the conditioned stimulusthe salivation (let-down) to the stimulus of the bell (let-down cue) alone is the conditioned reflex.Pavlov also found that:It is much easier to form a conditioned reflex if the unconditioned stimulus follows the conditioned one (i.e. the food follows the bell)It is easier to form a conditioned reflex if the conditioned stimulus (bell) occurs very close in time to the unconditioned stimulus (food)The intensity of the stimuli is important  a dog salivates more if trained on larger pieces of food; and it also salivates more in response to a louder bellTransferring this to nursing and let-down, we can surmise that:Your let-down cue should be used directly before and just as you begin nursing.Intensity makes a difference: Using a couple of different nursing cues at the beginning of nursing (for example, sitting down, getting a drink of water, and doing some deep breathing) should work better than just sitting down to nurse.While youre having problems with let-down, it may be helpful to try to nurse in as close to the same setting and same circumstances every time, or have at least one thing that you do thats the same every time you nurse (deep breathing, visualization, the same drink in the same cup, etc.). If you begin routinely using a few of these let-down cues, your let-down should kick right back in. Let-down cues that have proven helpfulUse all of your senses to facilitate let-down. Concentrate on the sight, sound, smell and feel of your baby. Have a certain beverage that you drink (the sense of taste) at the beginning of every nursing session, have a certain song that you listen to, etc.Directly before nursing: Take a warm shower or bath prior to nursing.If you are in any pain, consider taking some Advil or Tylenol about 30 minutes before you expect to nurse. Pain can cause stress and inhibit let-down.Choose a calm, less distracting setting for nursing.Turn on some music that you enjoy.Undress baby to his diaper and yourself from the waist up to increase skin-to-skin contact.Get something to drink, like a glass of water or a cup of tea.Sit in a comfortable chair with arm support and good back support or better, nurse while lying down.Get in a warm bath with baby and nurse there.Before putting baby to breast, massage your breasts and do some nipple rolls and gentle tugging. Moist heat on the breasts should be helpful, too. See Assisting the Milk Ejection Reflex in this information on the Marmet technique of manual expression.Reverse pressure softening helps let-down for some moms.During nursing:Deep breathe or use other relaxation techniques at the beginning of a feeding, like the techniques that are taught for childbirthSinging or humming can also speed let-down.Use visualization. Take several deep breaths and close your eyes as you begin. Try to visualize and feel what the let-down response feels like for you (if you normally feel anything). Some women imagine their milk flowing or use images of waterfalls. Some women concentrate on looking at babys soft little hand moving at moms breast, with fingers curled under. Some women use visualizations such as being on the beach or any other relaxing place. Use all five senses; imagine the sights, smells such as the salt air, sensations such as the feel of the sand under you or the warmth of the sun on your skin, imagine tastes and what you might hear too. An excellent book on visualization techniques is Mind Over Labor by Carl Jones.The opposite can also be helpful: watch TV, talk on the phone, read a book, etc.  whatever will relax you and get your mind off it.Place a heating pad on your shoulders and back. Get someone else to massage your back and shoulders before and while you nurse.Switch nurse: move baby back and forth frequently between breasts until let-down occursContinue to massage and use breast compression as you nurse.Additional suggestions if youre pumping while separated from baby:Look at a picture of your baby (nursing, if possible).Try listening to a tape recording of your baby fussing before nursing and/or feeding sounds. Use a portable tape player with headphones if needed. Or just visualize what he sounds like when hes ready to nurse.Put a sleeper or t-shirt or blanket that baby has worn in a ziplock bag. Open it up when ready to pump  smell and touch it.One study has shown that the moms of hospitalized babies who listened to guided relaxation or soothing music while pumping had an increased pumping output. When mom listened to a recording that included both music and guided relaxation while pumping, in addition to looking at photos of her baby, pumping output was increased even more. In this study, the interventions led to moms producing 2-3 times their normal pumping output. Milk fat content also increased for these moms in the early days of the study.

On Starting Solids,http://kellymom.com/fun/wisdom/solids/,"by Eleanor Goulding                 Smith  from The Complete Book of Absolutely Perfect Baby and Child Care,   copyright 1957, Harcourt, Brace and Co. (chapter two)  In the beginning, all you have to cram into the baby is milk                 and vitamins, but one day the pediatrician will say, Now you may                 start the baby on mashed banana. Or baby cereals. Or something                 mushy. Here again, it is easy enough for the pediatrician to say                 it. He doesnt have to come and get it into the baby. Thats your                 department. Should you feed him the mashed banana BEFORE he drinks                 his milk, when hes very hungry and therefore much more likely to                 try something new? Or, if hes very hungry will something other                 than milk make him very angry, and make him unable to take solid                 food as long as he lives? Or, if you give it to him after the milk,                 when hes feeling full, will he reject it because hes not hungry,                 and never in his entire life eat solid food? In fact, is it even                 possible to feed a baby anything but milk? This is a crucial moment.                 The baby cannot go through life living on milk. THE DOCTOR HAS SPOKEN.                 You have got to get that food into him. Get on the phone again.                 Consult all of your relatives who have ever had babies. Go out again                 and consult all the other mothers in your neighborhood. Ask the                 elevator man on the way.  You will soon find that you are the ONLY ONE who has any difficulty                 in the matter at all. The first mother you meet didnt give her                 baby MASHED BANANA. SHE gave hers Pablum. What kind of a pediatrician                 do you have, anyway? And there is no problem about when to give                 it. She gave hers the Pablum before the milk, and the baby didnt                 like it, but she got it into him anyway. After all, she says,                 the baby doesnt know whats good for him. The second mother didnt                 give hers solid food till he was six months old. What kind of a                 pediatrician do you have, anyway? And she gave it AFTER the milk,                 and he loved it the very first time. The third mother gave hers                 strained liver when he was only four weeks old, and what kind of                 a pediatrician do you have, anyway? She gave it in the MIDDLE of                 a feeding. It made him throw up, but after all, its the experience                 that counts.

So you go home again, and you try it before the milk, during the                 milk, and after the milk. But yours doesnt like it any time. So                 you try cereal. He doesnt like that either.  Now a PROBLEM has developed. Here is this baby and he refuses                 to eat his solid food. (Solid in this case is a euphemism for                 squushy.) Are you a failure as a parent? Is he a failure as a                 baby? Is the pediatrician a failure as a pediatrician? WOULD the                 baby rather have a hot pastrami sandwich?  This brings us to the primary rule of baby raising, which is the                 solution to this and all subsequent problems. This rule must be                 followed faithfully, and practiced regularly, and you should make                 it a habit to repeat it to yourself ten times a day. It is the Golden                 Rule of raising babies. LIE. Lie to your mother, lie to your sisters                 and aunts, and above all, lie to all the other mothers you meet                 on the street. When a newer mother than you asks for your help,                 tell her you never had the least trouble. YOUR baby just LOVED his                 mashed banana on the first try. Other quotes by Elinor Goulding Smith: It sometimes happens, even in the best of families, that a baby is born. This is not necessarily cause for alarm. The important thing is to keep your wits about you and borrow some money.All good qualities in a child are the result of environment, while all the bad ones are the result of poor heredity on the side of the other parent.More by Elinor Goulding SmithHow                 to Make Your Own Greek Temple from Elinor                 Goulding Smiths Great Big Messy BookFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Handy Tips,http://kellymom.com/fun/wisdom/handy-tips/,"Stuff your                 mother should have told you If she didnt, then perhaps she didnt                 know it either!  Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips. Use a meat baster to squeeze your pancake batter onto the hot griddle and youll get perfectly shaped pancakes every time. To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag with the potatoes. To prevent egg shells from cracking, add a pinch of salt to the water before hard-boiling. Run your hands under cold water before pressing Rice Krispies treats in the pan and the marshmallow wont stick to your fingers. To get the most juice out of fresh lemons, bring them to room temperature and roll them under your palm against the kitchen counter before squeezing. To easily remove burnt on food from your skillet, simply add a drop or two of dish soap and enough water to cover bottom of pan, and bring to a boil on stovetop. Spray your Tupperware with nonstick cooking spray before pouring in tomato-based sauces and there wont be any stains. When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there wont be any white mess on the outside of the cake. If you accidentally over salt a dish while its still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant fix me up. Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it will keep for weeks. Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish. Place a slice of apple in hardened brown sugar to soften it. When boiling corn on the cob, add a pinch of sugar to help bring out the corns natural sweetness. To determine whether an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it is fresh, but if it rises to the surface, throw it away. Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away. (And even if it doesnt, youll smell fresh all day!) Dont throw out all that leftover wine: Freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces. If you have a problem opening jars: Try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a nonslip grip that makes opening jars easy. A nutcracker also works. Potatoes will take food stains off your fingers. Just slice and rub raw potato on the stains and rinse with water. To get rid of itch from mosquito bites, try applying soap on the area and you will experience instant relief. Use air-freshener to clean mirrors. It does a good job and better still, leaves a lovely smell to the shine. When you get a splinter, reach for the scotch tape before resorting to tweezers or a needle. Simply put the scotch tape over the splinter, scotch tape removes the splinters painlessly and easily. Now look what you can do with Alka-Seltzer:Clean a toilet. Drop in two Alka-Seltzer tablets, wait   twenty minutes, brush, and flush. The citric acid and effervescent   action clean vitreous china.Clean a vase. To remove a stain from the bottom of   a glass vase or cruet, fill with water and drop in two Alka-Seltzer   tablets.Polish jewelry. Drop two Alka-Seltzer tablets into   a glass of water and immerse the jewelry for two minutes.Clean a thermos bottle. Fill the bottle with water,   drop in four Alka-Seltzer tablets, and let soak for an hour   (or longer, if necessary).Unclog a drain. Clear the sink drain by dropping three   Alka-Seltzer tablets down the drain followed by a cup of Heinz   White Vinegar. Wait a few minutes, then run the hot water.Flies or bees bothering you? Spray them with hairspray and they will take a quick dive.Sealed envelope? Put in the freezer for a few hours, then slide a knife under the flap. The envelope can then be resealed.Use Empty toilet paper roll to store appliance cords in. It keeps them neat and you can write on the roll what appliance it belongs to.For icy door steps in freezing temperatures: get warm water and put Dawn dishwashing liquid in it. Pour it all over the steps. They wont refreeze.Crayon marks on walls? A damp rag, dipped in baking soda. Comes off with little effort.Permanent marker on appliances/counter tops? Use rubbing alcohol on paper towel.Whenever you purchase a box of SOS Pads (steel wool), take a pair of scissors and cut each pad in half. Your SOS pads last longer, and the scissors get sharpened! Blood stains on clothes? Pour a little peroxide on a cloth and proceed to wipe off every drop of blood.Use vertical strokes when washing windows outside and horizontal for inside windows. This way you can tell which side has the streaks. Straight vinegar will get outside windows really clean. Dont wash windows on a sunny day. They will dry too quickly and will probably streak.Spray a bit of perfume on the light bulb in any room to create a lovely light scent in each room when the light is turned on.Place fabric softener sheets in dresser drawers and your clothes will smell freshly washed for weeks to come. You can also do this with towels and linen.Candles will last a lot longer if placed in the freezer for at least 3 hours prior to burning.To clean artificial flowers, pour some salt into a paper bag and add the flowers. Shake vigorously and the salt will absorb all the dust and dirt and leave your artificial flowers looking like new!Note: If no author is given, then the author is unknown.

A substitute for natural pregnancy…,http://kellymom.com/fun/wisdom/youterus/,"Author                 Unknown A substitute for natural pregnancy has been developed by Breed                 Bronson, Inc., makers of Infantill formula and other baby products.                 The YOUterus/Plus-centa unit was introduced in pharmacies and discount                 stores nationwide today.  A company representative explained the rationale for the product:                 Many women find it inconvenient to carry their fetuses and maintain                 a healthy food supply for them for an entire nine months. Pregnancy                 changes their figures, can interfere with job performance, and requires                 avoiding drugs and junk food. And some men dont like to be reminded                 that female sex organs dont exist solely for them.  After a womans fetus is implanted in a YOUterus/Plus-centa, the                 unit is simply kept in contact with a body having a temperature                 of 98.6* F. But after the second trimester,  commented the representative,                 the fetus can maintain its own warmth. It can be left completely                 alone, except for periodic refilling of the Plus-centa feeding solution. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. When asked if such technology would be an acceptable substitute                 for a womans experience of new life developing within her, the                 representative stated: We believe it will be fairly common for                 women to carry their own babies the first few weeks, when the thrill                 of motherhood is new. But soon, anyone experiencing nausea will                 be referred to our product. Eventually, anyone appearing pregnant                 after 6 months will be considered a fanatic.  Eventually there will be psychologists, completely ignorant of                 the history of human reproduction, who will state that after 6 months,                 natural gestation is harmful to the fetus independence.  All preliminary research has indicated that artificially fed fetuses                 are significantly less healthy than their naturally nourished counterparts.                 The Breed Bronson representative commented: The literature accompanying                 the units will state that natural pregnancy is preferable. But that                 wont affect sales. Well spend millions on freebies to obstetricians,                 and theyll convey to their patients that natural pregnancy is not                 greatly important, just a matter of personal preference.  Through advertising dollars, well also enlist the media. Television                 will present natural pregnancy as abnormal by never showing it.                 Yes, were expecting, your favorite sitcom character will say,                 our housekeeper is carrying the baby right now. Parents will come                 to believe that pregnancy, especially in public, is immodest.  In natural pregnancy, only mom carries and nourishes the baby.                 With a YOUterus/Plus-centa, dad, grandma and sitter will all have                 equal access. Well promote this idea that democracy, and not quality                 or safety, is what is important in fetal feeding.  When asked if the company was concerned about government regulation                 of a product proven harmful to developing babies, the representative                 stated: Are you kidding? We project the government will buy one                 third of our units to distribute to poor women. Note: If no author is given, then the author is unknown.

What if I want to wean while pregnant with a new baby?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/14weaning/,"Pregnancy has a way of making moms think of weaning,                 especially if it turns breastfeeding into an uncomfortable experience.                 It is important that you take your own needs into account with breastfeeding                 decisions.Many moms begin by reducing the duration of feeds (well nurse                 to the count of 10, or for the length of the ABC song). Moms can                 often stretch out the time between feeds by engaging in activities                 outside or exciting things like crafts inside. With honest communication                 you can talk with your child about the reductions without fueling                 sibling rivalry (Mamas num-nums have boo-boos right now                 during pregnancy, or after the baby comes You had num-nums                 all the time when you were a baby, too.

Oatmeal for increasing milk supply,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/supply-worries/oatmeal/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCEating a bowl of oatmeal, if nothing else, is healthy for mom.                 At best, it may be a simple way to increase milk supply.Eating a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast each morning is a frequently                 heard recommendation for increasing milk supply. Although there                 is no scientific evidence regarding oatmeal and milk supply, oatmeal                 does seem to work for some. Many working moms have noticed that                 on the days they eat oatmeal for breakfast, they can pump more milk                 than on the days they eat something else. In some countries, traditional                 wisdom recommends eating oatmeal as a way to increase milk                 supply. A number of lactation consultants recommend eating oatmeal                 as a way to increase supply. Some possible explanations:  Oatmeal is a good source of iron. It is known that maternal anemia/low iron levels can result in a decreased milk supply, so it makes sense that eating something high in iron might increase milk supply in some women.    Oatmeal is a comfort food for many women. Anything that increases relaxation in mom can encourage let-down, and hence also influence milk supply.  A use that some of the milk-increasing herbs share is that of decreasing cholesterol levels. Herbs used for both increasing milk production and decreasing cholesterol levels include fenugreek and alfalfa. Oat bran, which is in oatmeal, is also known to help lower cholesterol.Suggested   dosage:One   bowl of hot oatmeal (any type) every day. Some moms say that   they see an increase in supply when they eat anything made with   oats, including instant oatmeal and oatmeal cookies.Side   effects:Oats       are not associated with any adverse effectsThose       with gluten sensitivity (celiac disease) should eat oats       with cautionFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Is baby’s risk for type I diabetes increased if solids are introduced before 3 months or after 6 months?,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/starting-solids/solids-diabetes/,"Many parents have been concerned about the news reports suggesting                 that too-early or too-late introduction of solids might increase                 babys risk for type I diabetes. A couple of research studies in                 2003 examined timing of introduction of cereals and how this might                 affect an at-risk babys risk for type I diabetes. Following is                 more information on these studiesFollowing is a link to an abstract for one study on type I diabetes                 and introduction of solids that appeared in the Journal of the                 American Medical Association:Norris JM, Barriga K, Klingensmith G, Hoffman M, Eisenbarth GS,                 Erlich HA, Rewers M. Timing                 of initial cereal exposure in infancy and risk of islet autoimmunity. JAMA. 2003 Oct 1; 290(13): 1713-20.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. A related study also appeared in the same journal issue:Ziegler AG, Schmid S, Huber D, Hummel M, Bonifacio E. Early                 infant feeding and risk of developing type 1 diabetes-associated                 autoantibodies. JAMA. 2003 Oct 1; 290(13): 1721-8. Some basic information on the studies: The babies in these studies were all at increased risk for developing type I diabetes (most because they had a parent with type I diabetes).In both studies, introduction of rice or gluten-containing cereals before 3 months of age increased babys risk for type I diabetes.The first study showed increased risk for babies starting rice or gluten-containing cereals at 7 months or older. The abstract of this study does not give any information on breastfeeding duration or exclusivity, though I understand this datawas collected (at least to some extent)in the study. Besides these being babies with increased risk for type I diabetes, there is often a big difference in risk factors between babies not breastfed at all, babies with some breastfeeding, babies exclusively breastfed for 3-4 months, and babies exclusively breastfed for 6 months. The second study did not show an increased risk of type I diabetes for babies starting gluten containing foods after 6 months.One news                 article from DocGuide.com (aimed at doctors) gives additional                 information. The article notes: The adjusted hazard ratios were higher for                 the 1 to 3 months and the 7 months or older groups whether fed rice                 or gluten-containing cereals. However if cereals were introduced                 while the child was still breastfeeding the risk of islet autoimmunity                 was reduced and this reduction was independent of the childs age                 at initial cereal exposure. [emphasis                 added] A few quotes from a                 WebMDHealth article: Lead researcher Jill Norris, MPH, PhD,                 tells WebMD that it is not clear why introducing cereals late presents                 a problem, but it may be that children tend to eat more of a newly                 introduced food when they are older because they are hungrier. Studies                 in children with gluten sensitivity suggest that this may play a                 role in the disorder as the second study suggests. It may be that the immune system, even                 in older babies, requires a gradual introduction of foods, and that                 introducing too much of a particular food at one time presents a                 problem, Norris says.In an editorial accompanying the studies,                 diabetes researchers Mark Atkinson, PhD, and Edwin Gale, MD, urged                 clinicians and parents to use caution when interpreting the findings.It is clear that (these studies) do                 not present sufficient evidence to suggest that infant cereal causes                 diabetes, and hopefully will not be misinterpreted as such by parents                 and the public, they wrote.  Atkinson tells WebMD that even after two decades                 of research, the environmental trigger or triggers for type 1 diabetes                 remain unidentified.  I think these studies do put cereal                 at or near the top of the list of potential triggers, but we still                 have to look for other agents, he says. I feel for the                 families of these children because every few years there is a new                 idea about what causes type 1 diabetes, and, so far, none of them                 has been proven [to be a cause].

Anemia No More,http://kellymom.com/nutrition/vitamins/anemia-gone/,"How one mother successfully battled                 anemia in her baby without using iron supplements  Sierra was diagnosed with anemia when she was seven months, one                 week old  her level was 9.1. I was told to give her iron supplements                 three times a day, but after doing a lot of research I decided not                 to. The side effects of the iron seemed too severe since her iron                 levels were not very low, and she has a very delicate tummy!  Instead I decided to give her a combination of iron-rich and vitamin                 C-rich foods. She does not eat a lot, but she does like to feed                 herself little bits here and there whenever I eat, so I just made                 sure all of the little bits had iron or vitamin C. She insists on                 feeding herself  even things you need a spoon for!  Sierra had just started eating solid foods the week she turned                 6 months, just over a month before this happened. She was barely                 eating at the time we were going through all of this. She was eating                 about 1 tablespoon of food per day total when we started, and by                 the time we finished she was up to almost 2 tablespoons per day. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. Her diet consists of cheerios, avocado, all kinds of fresh veggie                 chunks & fresh fruit chunks, fried potatoes, fried tofu chunks,                 iron-fortified oatmeal (now with molasses), homemade rice cereal                 cookies, and soy yogurt. But it is still mostly breastmilk since                 she still nurses every two hours.  Well, we got her re-tested after 5 weeks (aged 8 months, 2 weeks).                 She is no longer anemic  I just found out. I am so happy!! Ironically,                 I almost caved and went and bought iron drops Saturday because she                 took a one hour nap two days in a row (she normally takes no more                 than a 10 or 15 minute nap) and I was convinced it was the anemia!                 Anyway, her levels are now normal. Her new level is 10.4 (10.2 is                 normal). I am amazed that we could get it up that much in such a                 short time with diet alone, considering how little she eats. I am                 going to continue giving her foods high in iron and vitamin C since                 I would like her numbers to be higher and she likes what she eats.

Too much milk: Sage and other herbs for decreasing milk supply,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/herbs-oversupply/,"SageThis is best used only if you are in the process of weaning,                 though it may also be used in extreme cases of oversupply when the usual measures are not effective. Be careful with this                 if you are not in the weaning process! Dont overdo it once                 youre seeing some results.To use dried sage (Salvia officinalis) for reducing milk supply,                 take 1/4 teaspoon of sage 3x per day for 1-3 days. You can mix the                 sage in vegetable juice (for example, V-8), but it wont mix well                 into other juices. You can also mix it into other foods. If you                 dont like the taste of sage, try putting it into a tiny piece of                 sandwich and swallowing it whole  peanut butter or something else                 a bit sticky seems to work best for holding the sage in place. Tear                 off the corner of the sandwich containing the sage (it should be                 a very small section) and swallow it without chewing (thats                 why you need a very small section).To use sage tea for decreasing milk supply, infuse 1 tablespoon                 of dried sage in 1 cup of boiling water (or 20g dried sage in 50                 ml boiling water). Steep for 5-15 minutes. Drink 1 cup, 2  6 times                 per day.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.You can use a tincture of sage instead: 30-60 drops of tincture,                 3-6 times a day. See Sage for additional safety information for nursing moms.CabbageGreen                 cabbage leaves can also be used topically on the breast to reduce                 milk supply. Again, be careful with this if you are not in the weaning                 process.JasmineAnother effective treatment is to apply fresh, crushed jasmine                 flowers (Jasminum sambac) to the breasts to decrease milk flow.                 A study has shown this to be effective: Shrivastav P, George K,                 Balasubramaniam N, Jasper MP, Thomas M, Kanagasabhapathy AS. Suppression                 of puerperal lactation using jasmine flowers (Jasminum sambac).                 Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol. 1988 Feb;28(1):68-71.Other herbsOther                 herbs that can decrease milk supply: Peppermint (Mentha piperita),                 Spearmint, Parsley (Petroselinum crispum), Chickweed, Black Walnut,                 stinging nettles (not nettle  that increases milk supply), Yarrow,                 Herb Robert (Geranium robertianum), Lemon Balm, Oregano, Periwinkle                 Herb (Vinca minor), Sorrel (Rumex acetosa).Sage, peppermint, spearmint, lemon balm, oregano, and cabbage leaves                 can all be incorporated into a pressed oil (cold pressed or hot)                 to make massage oils for milk suppression.Peppermint essential oil has been used traditionally for decreasing                 milk supply. Peppermint tea is a very weak form of peppermint and                 only large amounts (quarts) would be expected to decrease milk supply.                 Some women have successfully used the strong peppermint candies                 (for example, Altoids Curiously Strong Peppermints) for decreasing                 milk supply (a few per day arent likely to affect supply, though).Not herbs, but also @  Comfort measures for                 mom during weaningBirth                 control pills are well known for decreasing milk supply, particularly                 the ones that contain estrogen.Sudafed (a decongestant) can also decrease milk supply, particularly with                 regular use.

Oil of Oregano for thrush?,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/oregano_oil/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCI do not                 recommend that breastfeeding mothers use oil of oregano to treat                 thrushOil of oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) is sometimes suggested for                 treatment of thrush (candida/yeast). The recommendations I have                 seen for the use of oil of oregano for thrush treatment include                 topical use of the oil on babys feet and mothers nipples and internal                 use of the oil by the mother. There is nothing in the professional lactation literature thus                 far about oil of oregano, and little information elsewhere. There                 has been some discussion about it on Lactnet (an email discussion group for lactation professionals). Most agreed                 that without more substantive information it was not good practice                 to recommend it at this point. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.In-vitro studies have indicated that oil of oregano has antifungal                 and antimicrobial properties, however these effects have not yet                 been studied in humans.

Oregano should not be used during pregnancy as it stimulates menstruation and may cause miscarriage.12 The oil should not be used internally by anyone. Topically, the volatile oil of oregano may be moderately irritating to skin and can be a potent mucous membrane irritant. It should not be applied topically to mucous membranes in greater than a 1% concentration.13 Children less than two years of age and people with damaged or very sensitive skin should not use the oil topically.14 12.

Source: pureessentialoils.comOREGANO    Origanum vulgare L.     Should not be used when pregnant or by children. Possible skin, mucus membrane irritant. Possible hepatoxic in large levels.    From cherylsherbs.comSafety Issues:Most sources recommend that oil of oregano should not be taken internally, particularly by infants and young children. Anything applied to the nipple is likely to be ingested by baby unless it is washed off very well before nursing. Oils can be difficult to wash from the nipples, and trying to remove the oil thoroughly from already-sore nipples can be quite painful  better to use something that does not need to be washed off. Because oil of oregano is very irritating to the skin and mucus membranes, there is a very real concern about applying this oil to babys skin or to moms skin where it might come into contact with baby. Milk supply:Anecdotal evidence indicates that eating excessive amounts of oregano                 can decrease milk supply (the small amounts used to spice food are                 generally not considered to be a problem). A method used to decrease                 milk supply when weaning is to use a breast massage oil made with                 oil of oregano. Therefore using oil of oregano, either internally                 or topically, to treat thrush has the potential to decrease milk                 supply.Recommendation:Because this essential oil has not been shown to be effective for                 thrush treatment in humans and because of safety and milk supply                 issues, I do not recommend that breastfeeding mothers use oil of                 oregano to treat thrush. There are a number of thrush                 treatments that are known to be effective and safe, and thus                 would be a better choice over oil of oregano. FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Prescription drugs used for increasing milk supply,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/meds/prescript_galactagogue/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCThere are several prescription drugs that have been used to increase milk supply: Metoclopramide (Reglan), Domperidone (Motilium), and sulpiride (Eglonyl, Dolmatil, Sulpitil, Sulparex, Equemote).The presence of an appropriate level of the hormone prolactin permits lactation to proceed normally. When a mother has low prolactin levels, milk supply may be affected. Prolactin levels are primarily regulated by inhibition: the presence of prolactin-inhibiting factors (dopamine is the principal one) keep prolactin levels in check. The drugs used for increasing milk supply work by blocking dopamine, which results in an increase in prolactin levels. These drugs do not work in all women and would not be expected to increase milk production in a woman who already has normal (high) prolactin levels.Reglan has often been used in the U.S.. One major side-effect of Reglan is severe depression; it is contraindicated in moms with a history of depression, and all moms who take this should keep an eye out for signs of depression. One of my sources advises all adoptive mothers to stay away from Reglan, since it has caused serious depression/anxiety in moms regardless of previous history. This depression side effect usually develops over 3-4 weeks, and goes away if mom discontinues the Reglan. Other side effects include diarrhea, sedation, gastric upset, nausea, seizures and extrapyramidal effects (twitching, etc.)Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Domperidone has been used successfully in Canada and other areas of the world, and has significantly fewer side effects than Reglan. It was approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics for use in breastfeeding mothers (this list is no longer maintained), and has been given Lactation Risk Category L1 (safest) in the 2014 edition of Medications and Mothers Milk. It is not available in the U.S. because the FDA issued a warning against it in 2004. See the links below for more info.Sulpiride is commonly used in various countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa and Chile. The primary use for sulpiride is for schizophrenia (it is an antipsychotic and antidepressant), but it also increases serum prolactin levels and thus can enhance breast milk yield.Prescription drugs that stimulate lactationName of medicationLactation Risk Category**Domperidone (Motilium, Motilidone)L1 (safest)Metoclopramide (Reglan)L2 (safer)Sulpiride (Dolmatil, Sulparex, Sulpitil, Eglonyl, Equemote)L2 (safer)** Per Medications and Mothers Milk by Thomas Hale, PhD (2014 edition) Hale reports results of a number of studies and indicates that domperidone is preferred but not available in the US.

First, you should know that I am a lactation consultant, I recently gave birth to my fourth child and despite my training and knowledge, I was in need of a galactogogue. I opted for Reglan upon consultation with my physician and despite a history of mild depression. After taking the medication for approximately 6 weeks, I decided it was time to taper off of the medication. Within 48 hours of my last dose, I began to suffer from severe anxiety and eventually even had one panic attack. I have never had any problems with, or history of anxiety or panic attacks in my life and as the result of an in-depth assessment by an anxiety disorder specialist, it was determined that this development was directly related to my use of Reglan. This experience was absolutely horrible! I was bed ridden for 10 days and it took a total of three weeks for me to recover completely. Subsequently, my milk supply suffered substantially from the physical insult. I have since, however, been able to recover it partially only after arduous pumping and retraining of my baby to take the breast once again.As a lactation consultant, I will be happy to educate my clients on the use of this drug, but I will never again recommend it myself.LauraReglan (Metoclopramide) from LowMilkSupply.comReglan from Breastfeeding OnlineFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding when baby has surgery,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/baby-surgery/,"How long before & after general anesthesia is it safe for baby to nurse?Compiled by Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCMany times, when baby is scheduled to undergo surgery, the mother is told no breastfeeding after midnight the night before surgery or no breastfeeding less than 8 hours prior to surgery. Many moms are understandably concerned about this, since withholding nursing from a baby or young child for this amount of time will frequently result in a miserable time for all concerned. Not only is baby hungry, but mom and babys most useful comforting tool  nursing  is also gone.The most current studies say that babies can safely breastfeed 4 hours prior to surgery.  Breastfeeding may be safely resumed when your baby leaves the recovery room.

This is widely considered to be among the best anaesthesia departments in the US.From the guidelines: Plan the last breastfeeding so that the feeding is finished three hours before the time of surgery. You may give clear liquids up to three hours before the surgery. Clear liquids include breast milk, infant electrolyte solution (such as Pedialyte), apple juice, and sugar water.American Society of Anesthesiologists: Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting (PDF version) (effective January 1, 1999) Although the American Society of Anesthesiologists is more conservative than Childrens Hospital Boston (4 hours rather then 3), this is still much better than the commonly heard no nursing for 8 hours before surgery.From the guidelines: Studies show that there are significant benefits to allowing patients to drink clear liquids up to two hours before surgery Breast milk is more easily digested than nonhuman milk but should not be given to babies less than four hours before surgery. The guidelines state that surgical patients should avoid solid food, nonhuman milk and infant formula for at least eight hours before surgery.Mohrbacher N.Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple. Amarillo, Texas: Hale Publishing, 2010: p 317.Page 317: A Cochrane Review of the research stated: clear liquids up to a few hours before surgery did not increase the risk of regurgitation during or after surgery. Indeed there is added benefit of a more comfortable preoperative experience. (Brady, Kinn, ORourke, Randhawa, & Stuart, 2005). U.S. researchers wrote: after nearly 15 years of practice worldwide, the relative safety and benefits of [the following guidelines] are well established [Cook-Sather & Litman, 2006):Light meal: 6 hoursFormula: 4 hoursHuman milk: 3 hoursClear liquids: 2 hoursReferences (most recent listed first)Maxwell LG and Yaster M. Perioperative management issues in pediatric patients. Anesthesiol Clin North Am 2000 Sep; 18(3); 601-632.FASTING GUIDELINES: The classic literature and texts of anesthesiology have been replete with the mantra of the association of gastric fluid volume with the risk of aspiration pneumonia, and resulted in rigid guidelines that were NPO after midnight for adult and pediatric patients. Exhaustive recent examinations of many studies, including an ASA taskforce, have concluded that these associations, formerly considered iron-clad, are anything but. Because such rigid guidelines in children caused fussy, possibly hypoglycemic patients in the age of outpatient surgery, studies documenting no increase in gastric volume with liberalization of clear liquid administration have led to a relaxation of fasting guidelines in practice in the United States and the United Kingdom. This change in practice recently has been confirmed by the recommendations of the ASA taskforce. These guidelines can be summarized most easily as 8-6-4-2 (i.e., 8 hours solids, 6 hours formula, 4 hours breast milk, 2 hours clear liquids). This change in practice can result in decreased numbers of canceled cases, and in pediatric patients who are less irritable preoperatively and less dehydrated at the time of anesthesia induction. The liberalization, however, applies only to clear liquids, and communicating the correct guidelines to parents can be problematic, resulting in some patients who still consume formula and must be delayed and in others who still have been NPO since midnight. Patients undergoing emergency surgery, those with anatomic bowel obstruction, and those who are not NPO must have their risk for aspiration balanced against the urgency of the surgery. Most trauma patients and others requiring emergency surgery have delayed gastric emptying, reducing the utility of having to wait a prescribed period of time until induction of anesthesia. Those patients should have a rapid sequence induction in any case.Lawrence R and Lawrence R. Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession, 5th ed. St. Louis: Mosby 1999, p. 496-497.Instructions to breastfeeding mothers should limit the amount of breastfeeding after 4 hours and permit feeding on a prepumped breast, predominantly for comfort. The infant who requires surgery or rehospitalization can and should be breastfed postoperatively in most cases The infant who is hospitalized is already traumatized by the separation, the strange surroundings and people, and the underlying discomfort of the disease process itself. If the infant is to be fed orally, feeding should be at the breast as often as possible The infant should not be subjected to the added trauma of being weaned from the breast when the infant needs the security and intimacy of nursing mose, unless weaning is absolutely unavoidable.Ferrari LR et al. Preoperative fasting practices in pediatrics. Anesthesiology 1999 Apr; 90(4): 978-80.There is less agreement about breast milk feeding. Some institutions (36%) consider the composition of breast milk to be equivalent to that of a clear fluid, others (34%) equivalent to a solid, and the remaining institutions consider it something else. This is likely due to the paucity of data examining absorption of breast milk in healthy infants. Most institutions (77%) consider at least a 4-h fast for breast milk to be sufficient; only 23% allowed breast milk to be ingested less than 4 h before induction In conclusion, this study shows the variation in fasting patterns and the difficulty in developing practice guidelines. It is far easier to simplify guidelines by making all patients NPO after midnight. This is not the optimal or safest practice for pediatric anesthesia, nor is it the accepted practice of the majority of clinicians. The question posed to the pediatric anesthesia community is Can reasonable guidelines be developed that could be agreed on by the majority of practitioners? Our results indicate that a 2-4-6-8 rule represents the majority of institutions that provide anesthesia for children in North America. This restricts clear fluids for 2 h, breast milk for 4 h, formula for 6 h, and solid food for 8 h before induction of anesthesia. In elective surgical procedures, acceptance of this as a guideline deserves further discussion by the anesthesia community and would serve to simplify the current confusing and arbitrary policies that exist in different institutions.Emerson BM. Pre-operative fasting for paediatric anaesthesia. A survey of current practice. Anaesthesia 1999; 53(4) 326-330.Abstract: There has recently been much debate about pre-operative fasting for paediatric anaesthesia. There is no consensus about the optimum fasting times for children undergoing elective surgery. In order to establish a standard for paediatric pre-operative fasting times, we undertook a postal survey, targeting members of the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists resident in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1995. One hundred and sixty-three questionnaires were dispatched, 131 (80%) were returned and 110 (67%) were complete. The results show that the following guidelines for duration of fast are acceptable to the majority of respondents-neonates: 2 h for clear fluids, 4 h for breast and formula milk; infants: 2 h for clear fluids, 4 h for breast milk, 6 h for formula milk and solids; children: 2 h for clear fluids, 6 h for milk and solids. We suggest that these times be used as guidelines and audited for pre-operative fasting in paediatric anaesthesia.Splinter WM. Preoperative fasting in children.

Pediatr Clin North Am 1998 Dec; 45(6): 1525-37Patients need to have fasted appropriately before surgery. Although no universal agreement exists among anesthesiologists when it comes to fasting, several accepted standards do exist. It is generally believed that, to minimize the risks of aspiration, an adult patient should be NPO approximately 8 hours before surgery. The rules differ slightly for pediatric patients. At Childrens Hospital of Buffalo, it is generally believed that children should have no solid food for at least 6 hours before surgery. Breast milk and other such semisolids are usually considered acceptable up to 3 hours before surgery; clear liquids are acceptable until 2 hours before surgery.OHare B, Lerman J, Endo J, Cutz E.

There is no mention of breastmilk, but it deals with the problem that many children end up fasting much longer than intended. The authors believe that a clear fluid drink should be prescribed 3 hours before surgery.Litman RS, et al. Gastric Volume and pH in infants fed clear liquids and breastmilk prior to surgery. Anesth Analg. 1994;79:482-5.In a prospective, blinded study, 24 breastfed infants nursed as usual 2hours prior to surgery (feeding ended by 1 1/2 hours before anesthesiainduction). After induction of general anesthesia and tracheal intubation,gastric fluid samples were aspirated and volume and pH were measured.Sufficient gastric fluid for analysis was obtained from 8 (33 %) of theinfants. The volumes were great enough that the authors do not recommendbreastfeeding less than 3 hours before surgery. The majority of theinfants had residual gastric contents which were alkaline. Animal studiessuggest that this higher pH may confer an advantage in case of pumonaryaspiration. The formula fed infants in the study were safely able toreceive 2  8 ounces of clear liquids up to 2 hours prior to surgery.Schreiner MS. Preoperative and postoperative fasting in children. Ped Clinics N. Am. 1994; 41(1):111-20.Until early 1990 perioperative oral fluid management for children could besummarized as Starve Preop: Feed Postop. Recent advances have reversedthe conventional wisdom and now allow children to drink clear liquids upuntil 2 hours prior to surgery and to fast after surgery until they want toeat. The pattern of gastric emptying of milk, formula and breast milkneeds further investigation The authors recommendations are for clearliquids to be stopped 2-3 hours before arrival at the hospital for daysurgery anesthesia, and breast milk 3 hours before. He refers to a 1987study by Tomomosa (Gastroduodenal motility in neonates: response to human milk compared with cows milk formula. Pediatrics 1987; 80:434) that showed that 3 hours after a test meal, 75% of breastfed infants but only 17% of formula fed infants had entered a fasting state.

Anesthesiology. 1992 Apr; 76(4): 528-33.Abstract: The ability to drink clear liquids without vomiting after anesthesia and surgery is a commonly used criteria for discharge of pediatric day surgery patients. We hypothesized that the ability to drink as a prerequisite for discharge would not affect the frequency of vomiting, delay discharge, or increase the frequency of readmission of children for dehydration after day surgical procedures. We randomized 989 patients between the ages of 1 month and 18.0 yr to one of two groups. The 464 mandatory drinkers were required to demonstrate the ability to drink clear liquids without vomiting prior to discharge from the hospital, whereas 525 elective drinkers were allowed but not required to drink. Other than the discharge criteria, the patients were managed in an identical fashion; the minimum volume of intravenous fluids received by all patients was adequate to supply a calculated 8-h fluid deficit prior to discharge from the hospital. There were no differences between the two groups in the incidence of vomiting in the operating room, the postanesthesia care unit, or after discharge from the hospital. However, in the day surgery unit, only 14% of the elective drinkers vomited compared to 23% of the mandatory drinker group (P less than 0.001). The mandatory drinkers had a more prolonged stay in the day surgical unit, averaging 101 +/- 58 min (mean +/- SD) compared to 84 +/- 40 min for elective drinkers (P less than 0.001). No patient in either group required admission to the hospital for persistent vomiting on the day of surgery, and no patient required readmission for vomiting or dehydration after discharge from the day surgery unit.Spear R.

Ingestion of liquids compared with preoperative fasting in pediatric outpatients. Anesthesiology. 1990 Apr; 72(4): 593-7.Abstract: The preoperative fast is often an unpleasant preoperative experience that might be alleviated by allowing children to drink clear liquids. The authors compared gastric fluid volume and pH in two groups of children, one of whom was permitted clear liquids until 2 h before surgery (study group) and the other followed routine preoperative fasting orders (control group). The study group was not limited in the quantity of clear liquid allowed with the exception that the last intake prior to surgery was limited to 8 ounces. The study group (n = 53) averaged 5.9 +/- 5 yr and weighed 23.6 +/- 17 kg, while the control group averaged 7.3 +/- 4.6 yr and weighed 29 +/- 17.7 kg (P = NS). Gastric contents were aspirated following induction of anesthesia. Gastric fluid volume averaged 0.44 +/- 0.51 ml/kg for study group and 0.57 +/- 0.51 ml/kg in the control group (P = 0.12). Of the study patients, 48% had a measured gastric fluid volume greater than or equal to 0.4 ml/kg compared with 58% of the control patients (P = 0.77). Eighty three patients had sufficient gastric fluid for pH determination; of these 34/35 (97%) in the study group and 44/48 (92%) in the control group had a gastric fluid pH less than or equal to 2.5. Using a linear analog scale parents rated the children in the study group to be less irritable (P less than 0.001) and to have had a better overall preoperative experience (P less than 0.01) compared with the control patients.Cavell B: Gastric emptying in infants fed human milk or infant formula. Acta Paediatr Scand 1981; 70:639.Abstract: Gastric emptying of meals of human milk or infant formula was studied in 17 healthy infants aged 4 weeks to 6 months using a marker dilution technique. In the 24 studies performed gastric emptying followed a biphasic pattern in 11 and a linear pattern in 12 studies. The average gastric half-emptying time for meals of human milk was 48 min, and for meals of infant formula 78 min. After 1 hour an average of 29.5 ml of human milk and 22.7 ml of infant formula per 0.1 m2 of body surface area had emptied from the stomach.Pildes RS, Blumenthal I, Ebel A.

Perchlorate in Breastmilk,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/chemicals/perchlorate-breastmilk/,"by Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCThere has been a large amount of press about a recent study that detected perchlorate in the breastmilk of American women.What is perchlorate? Perchlorate is a salt that is found naturally in some areas of the world, and is also manufactured for various purposes. One of the perchlorate salts, ammonium perchlorate, is used as an oxidizer to help solid rocket fuel burn. Per the US Environmental Protection Agency, Most of the perchlorate manufactured in the United States is used as the primary ingredient of solid rocket propellant. Wastes from the manufacture and improper disposal of perchlorate-containing chemicals are increasingly being discovered in soil and water. Another perchlorate salt, potassium perchlorate, was used therapeutically for many years to treat certain types of hyperthyroidism.Why might perchlorate be a problem? Perchlorate competes with iodine in the body. In large enough doses, perchlorate can inhibit iodine uptake into the thyroid and may inhibit the secretion of iodine into human milk (research is conflicting on this point).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Per The National Research Councils Health Implications of Perchlorate Ingestion (p 30, 43-44), Lower intakes [of iodine] are associated with increasing frequency of thyroid enlargement (goiter), biochemical evidence of thyroid hormone deficiency, and ultimately, in people with severe iodine deficiency, hypothyroidism If inhibition of iodine uptake were prolonged, the result should be iodide deficiency in the thyroid, similar to that which occurs in dietary iodide deficiency, and with the same consequences and compensation.See Responses to Concerns for more information on perchlorate as it relates to breastfeeding.Following are links with more information on perchlorate and breastfeeding.Information on the studiesTexas Tech Study  February 2005Comments by Texas Tech Study Author  March 3, 2005Texas Tech Study  September 2003Chilean StudiesResponses to concernsMore informationInformation on the studiesTexas Tech Study  February 2005Comments by Author: Perchlorate in Breastmilk by Purnendu K Dasgupta.

What should I know about giving my breastfed baby a pacifier?,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/newborn-concerns/pacifier/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC When can I begin using a pacifier?It is recommended that pacifiers and other types of artificial nipples be avoided for at least the first 3-4 weeks. Id personally suggest that most breastfed babies  if they get a pacifier at all  would be better off without a pacifier until moms milk supply is well established (6-8 weeks, usually) and the 6 week growth spurt is over. That way youve established a good milk supply and dont lose any much-needed breast stimulation to a pacifier. What should I consider before using a pacifier?After the early weeks, pacifier use is less likely to cause problems as long as you are aware of the following:Never substitute a pacifier for a feeding at the breast or try to hold the baby off longer between feedings with one. (See Should baby be on a schedule?)There are studies that indicate that babies who take a pacifier tend to wean earlier than those who do not. This is most likely because as a baby gets older  once hes established on solid food  it is often his desire to suck that ensures he continues to seek out the breast often. Babies who use pacifiers are getting that need to suck met with something other than the breast, and therefore may decide to give up breastfeeding sooner than if they did not take a pacifier.Some babies who take pacifiers are more prone to oral yeast (thrush) which can be transferred to moms nipples.A number of studies have shown a link between pacifier use and an increased incidence of ear infections.Pacifiers can result in choking or strangulation if the pacifier breaks or if it is tied around the neck (which it never should be). Follow all safety guidelines and keep an eye out for the many pacifier safety recalls. Also, keep in mind that latex allergy is becoming an increasing problem  consider using a silicone pacifier rather than latex.Prolonged pacifier use can result in teeth misalignment, and can also occasionally lead to shaping of the soft palate or speech problems.Giving baby a pacifier will increase moms chances of ovulating and getting pregnant. Exclusive breastfeeding, depending upon your breastfeeding frequency and other factors, is a method of birth control that can be more than 98% effective during the first 6 months and 94% effective during the second six months. Ensuring that all of babys sucking needs are met at the breast increases the effectiveness of this method of contraception.When to avoid the pacifierIf you observe any of the following problems, it would be a good idea to discontinue pacifier use, at least until the problem is resolved:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Pacifier use reduces your babys frequency or duration of feeds (newborns should be nursing at least 8 to 12 times a day).Baby is having difficulties nursing well (this may be due to nipple confusion).Baby is having problems with weight gain (in which case baby needs to nurse as often as possible).Mom is having problems with sore nipples (baby may be causing this due to nipple confusion)Mom is having milk supply problems (in which case she needs to put baby to breast, not pacifier, at every opportunity in order to increase milk supply).Mom and/or baby have thrush, particularly if its hard to get rid of or repeated.Baby is having repeated ear infections (an increased incidence of ear infections has been linked to pacifier use).Can pacifiers help prevent SIDS?Have you heard that pacifier use might help to prevent SIDS? Heres what the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding says about this in their February 2012 Policy Statement:Given the documentation that early use of pacifiers may be associated with less successful breastfeeding, pacifier use in the neonatal period should be limited to specific medical situations. These include uses for pain relief, as a calming agent, or as part of structured program for enhancing oral motor function. Because pacifier use has been associated with a reduction in SIDS incidence, mothers of healthy term infants should be instructed to use pacifiers at infant nap or sleep time after breastfeeding is well established, at approximately 3 to 4 weeks of age.In conclusionAs long as you keep the above in mind and only use a pacifier sparingly, it is up to you whether and when you wish to comfort baby yourself or with a pacifier. However, keep in mind that there is no scientific evidence that suggests that babies have a need to suck independant of the need for food. When a baby is indicating a sucking need, its generally best that baby be encouraged to breastfeed, especially if there is a weight gain concern. The breast was the first pacifier and in most cases remains the best.More informationIs your baby nursing all the time? @ Pacifiers by Diane Wiessinger, MS, IBCLCPacifiers: Yes or No? by Gwen Gotsch.

Breastfeeding and Alcohol,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/alcohol/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCGuidelinesCurrent research says that occasional use of alcohol (1-2 drinks) does not appear to be harmful to the nursing baby.Per Hale (2012), mothers who ingest alcohol in moderate amounts can generally return to breastfeeding as soon as they feel neurologically normal.The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding notes: ingestion of alcoholic beverages should be minimized and limited to an occasional intake but no more than 0.5 g alcohol per kg body weight, which for a 60 kg mother is approximately 2 oz liquor, 8 oz wine, or 2 beers. Nursing should take place 2 hours or longer after the alcohol intake to minimize its concentration in the ingested milk.Many experts recommend against drinking more than 1-2 drinks per week.There is no need to pump & dump milk after drinking alcohol, other than for moms comfort  pumping & dumping does not speed the elimination of alcohol from the milk.Alcohol does not increase milk production, and has been shown to inhibit let-down and decrease milk production (see below).If youre away from your baby, try to pump as often as baby usually nurses (this is to maintain milk supply, not because of the alcohol). At the very least, pump or hand express whenever you feel uncomfortably full  this will help you to avoid plugged ducts and mastitis.In general, if you are sober enough to drive, you are sober enough to breastfeed. Less than 2% of the alcohol consumed by the mother reaches her blood and milk. Alcohol peaks in moms blood and milk approximately 1/2-1 hour after drinking (but there is considerable variation from person to person, depending upon how much food was eaten in the same time period, moms body weight and percentage of body fat, etc.). Alcohol does not accumulate in breastmilk, but leaves the milk as it leaves the blood; so when your blood alcohol levels are back down, so are your milk alcohol levels.Image credit: kizzzbeth on flickr CC BY 2.0Always keep in mind the babys age when considering the effect of alcohol. A newborn has a very immature liver, so minute amounts of alcohol would be more of a burden. Up until around 3 months of age, infants detoxify alcohol at around half the rate of an adult. An older baby or toddler can metabolize the alcohol more quickly.Effects of alcohol on breastfeeding and the breastfed babyAlcohol does not increase milk production. In fact, babies nurse more frequently but take in less milk in the 3-4 hours after mom has had a drink, and one study showed a 23% decrease in milk volume with one drink (Mennella & Beauchamp 1991, 1993; Mennella 1997, 1999).2+ drinks may inhibit let-down (Coiro et al 1992; Cobo 1974).One study showed changes in the infants sleep-wake patterning after short-term exposure to small amounts of alcohol in breastmilk  infants whose mothers were light drinkers slept less (Mennella & Gerrish 1998).Daily consumption of alcohol has been shown in the research to increase the risk for slow weight gain in the infant.Daily consumption of alcohol (1+ drinks daily) has been associated with a decrease in gross motor development (Little et al 1989).Additional informationLLL FAQ on Alcohol & BreastfeedingNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Alcohol and breastfeeding, from The Breastfeeding Network, by Wendy Jones PhD, MRPharmSBeer as a Galactagogue  A Brief History byHilary JacobsonMalt as a Galactagogue  A Brief HistorybyHilary JacobsonAlcohol and Motherhood by Carol Huotari, from Leaven, Vol. 33 No. 2, April-May 1997, pp. 30-1Social Drugs and Breastfeeding: Handling an issue that isnt black and white by Denise Fisher, BN, RN, RM, IBCLC.

Breastfeeding and Caffeine,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/caffeine/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCIntroductionIs baby sensitive to my caffeine intake?Does caffeine decrease milk supply?Caffeine SourcesHow much caffeine is too much?More informationReferencesIntroductionMost breastfeeding mothers can drink caffeine in moderation. Some babies, particularly those under 6 months, may be more sensitive to moms caffeine intake. Babies whose mothers avoided caffeine completely during pregnancy seem to react more to caffeine in moms diet. Even if baby is sensitive to the caffeine now, he may not be when hes a little older  so if you do have to stop or limit your caffeine intake, you can try again when baby is older.Per Medications and Mothers Milk (Hale 2010, p. 150-151) caffeine is in Lactation Risk Category L2 (safer); milk levels are quite low (0.06-1.5% of maternal dose) and usually peak 1-2 hours after ingestion. One study has indicated that chronic coffee drinking might decrease iron content of breastmilk (Nehlig & Debry, 1994). The American Academy of Pediatrics has classified caffeine as a Maternal Medication Usually Compatible with Breastfeeding. Caffeine is given directly to premature babies (as a treatment for breathing problems) in much higher levels than than those generally found in the breastmilk of mothers who consume caffeine.If your baby is sensitive to caffeine, it will typically become less of an issue as baby gets older. Newborns have a much harder time metabolizing caffeine than older infants. Preterm or ill infants might also have more problems with moms caffeine intake.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Half-Life of CaffeineAgeHalf-LifeNewborn65-130 hours [2.7-5.4 days]3  5 monthsapprox. 14 hours4-9 months3-7 hoursAdult3-7 hoursReferences: USP DI 2001, Hale 2010Is baby sensitive to my caffeine intake?According to the Breastfeeding Answer Book (LLLI 2003, p. 599-600), excessive caffeine consumption by the mother (more than 750 mg per day) can result in a baby who shows signs of caffeine stimulation. A baby who is being overstimulated by caffeine is a wide-eyed, active, alert baby who doesnt sleep for long. He may also be unusually fussy.If your baby seems particularly wakeful or fussy and there is a significant amount of caffeine in your diet, you might want to cut back or stop the caffeine for 2-3 weeks to see if it makes a difference. If you cut out caffeine, consider decreasing it slowly since abruptly stopping caffeine can result in headaches or other symptoms.If caffeine stimulation is a problem for baby, it may take a few days to a week after mom eliminates caffeine for baby to become less fussy.Does caffeine decrease milk supply?flicker image: Alexander Lyubavin CC BY 2.0There is no evidence that caffeine decreases milk supply.The myth that caffeine will decrease milk supply is widespread. Many moms consume caffeine, and it ought to be easy to document any adverse effects of caffeine on milk supply. No such effect has been observed, however, despite a number of studies of caffeine intake in breastfeeding mothers and years of clinical observations. In fact, one study (Nehlig & Debry, 1994) indicates that caffeine can stimulate milk production. A baby who is fussy and jittery from caffeine stimulation may not nurse well, however, which could lead to a decreased milk supply over time (due to decreased nursing, rather than the mothers caffeine intake).Caffeine SourcesCaffeine can be found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, sports/energy drinks (including the sports water products), some over-the-counter and prescription medications, and foods containing coffee or chocolate. Herbal products containing guarana/paullinea cupana, kola nut/cola nitida, yerba mat, or green tea also contain caffeine.

As stated above, the amount of caffeine that might affect baby will vary widely depending upon the specific baby and the babys age and health. The estimate we often hear is less than five 5-oz cups of coffee or 500 mg/day. Various sources suggest an upper limit for caffeine intake ranging from 300-750 mg/day.During pregnancy: Most sources suggest a 300 mg/day upper limit on caffeine for pregnant moms. However, one source (Motherisk) recommends an upper of limit 150 mg caffeine per day during pregnancy.The table below shows various suggested upper limits for caffeine in terms of amounts of coffee, tea, soda, etc.Equivalent caffeinated products for various daily caffeine intakesFoodCaffeineContent150 mg300 mg500 mgStarbucks Coffee250 mg/8 oz (short)375 mg/12 oz (tall)500 mg/16 oz (grande)1/2 cup (short)1 cup (short)2 cups (short)1.5 cups (tall)1 cup (grande)Coffee, brewed(non-gourmet)100 mg/5 oz160 mg/8 oz1.5 cups (5-oz)1 cup (8-oz)3 cups (5-oz)2 cups (8-oz)5 cups (5-oz)3 cups (8-oz)Starbucks Frappuccino98 mg/9.5 oz bottle1.5 bottles3 bottles5 bottlesDiet Coke46 mg/12 oz can77 mg/20 oz bottle3 cans (12-oz)2 bottles (20-oz)6.5 cans (12-oz)4 bottles (20-oz)11 cans (12-oz)6.5 bottles (20-oz)Pepsi-Cola40 mg/12 oz can67 mg/20 oz bottle3.5 cans (12-oz)2 bottles (20-oz)7.5 cans (12-oz)4.5 bottles (20-oz)12.5 cans (12-oz)7.5 bottles (20-oz)Tea, leaf or bag48 mg/8 oz3 cups (8-oz)6 cups (8-oz)10 cups (8-oz)Hagen-Dazs Coffee Ice Cream24 mg/4 oz serving6 servings (4-oz)12.5 servings (4-oz)20 servings (4-oz)Dannon Coffee Yogurt36 mg/6 oz serving4 servings (6-oz)8 servings (6-oz)13 servings (6-oz)More informationSocial Drugs and Breastfeeding: Handling an issue that isnt black and white by Denise Fisher, BN, RN, RM, IBCLC.

Birth Control and Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/meds/birthcontrol/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCMost methods of contraception that women use are not considered to be harmful to their breastfed children, but some forms of contraceptives can be very harmful to milk supply.Combination contraceptivesCombination contraceptives contain both progesterone and estrogen and come in several different forms:combination birth control pillskin patch (Ortho Evra)vaginal ring (Nuvaring)Estrogen-containing contraceptives have been linked to low milk supply and a shorter duration of breastfeeding even when started when baby is older, after milk supply is well established. Not all mothers who take contraceptives containing estrogen will experience a low milk supply, but these unaffected mothers appear to be a very small minority. Thomas Hale, PhD (author of Medications and Mothers Milk) notes, Mothers who have problems with milk production and those who are breastfeeding an older child (one year old or more) should be especially cautious.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Progestin-only contraceptivesProgestin-only contraceptives are the preferred choice for breastfeeding mothers when something hormonal is desired or necessary.Progestin-only contraceptives come in several different forms:progestin-only pill (POP) also called the mini-pillbirth control injection (Depo-Provera)progesterone-releasing IUD (Mirena, Skyla)birth control implant (Implanon, Nexplanon)For most mothers, progestin-only forms of contraception do not cause problems with milk supply if started after the 6th-8th week postpartum and if given at normal doses. However, there are many reports (most anecdotal but nevertheless worth paying attention to) that some women do experience supply problems with these pills, so if you choose this method you still need to proceed with some caution.If youre interested in one of the longer lasting progestin-only forms of birth control (the Depo-Provera injection lasts at least 12 weeks, but effects may be seen up to a year; the progesterone-releasing IUDs and implant last 3-5 years), it is recommended that you do a trial of progestin-only pills (mini-pill) for a month or more before deciding on the longer-term form of birth control. If you find that you are among the women whose supply drops significantly due to progestin-only birth control, you can simply discontinue the pills  rather than struggling with low milk supply for several months until the injection wears off or you get the implant or IUD removed.Do note that the progesterone-releasing IUD delivers its hormone directly to the lining of the uterus, which only leads to a slight increase in progesterone levels in the blood stream (much lower than that found with the progesterone-only pill). As a result, there is much less chance of side effects from the progesterone than from the injection or mini-pill.Milk composition: At higher doses than normal this type of pill can affect the content of breastmilk. At these higher doses it has been shown to decrease the protein/nitrogen and lactose content of the milk. At regular doses, this does not seem to be as likely.Morning-After pillsMorning-after pills should be used only as a last resort (whether you are breastfeeding or not).There are currently two types of products on the market packaged specifically as morning-after pills:a combination pill containing estrogen and progestina progestin-only pillMilk supply: Estrogen, in particular, has been linked to low milk supply in nursing moms. There may be a slight drop in milk supply a few days after taking the morning-after pill, but milk levels should rebound thereafter. See Increasing Low Milk Supply for additional info on increasing milk supply.Safety: The morning after pill is considered compatible with breastfeeding, but should only be used rarely. Not the first choice for routine birth control, it should be used only as a last resort (whether breastfeeding or not). Both progestin and estrogen are considered compatible with breastfeeding by the AAP.Side effects related to lactationMilk supply: As noted above, hormonal birth control pills (particularly those containing estrogen) have the potential to decrease milk supply, sometimes dramatically.Effects on baby: There have been no adverse reports of side effects to the baby. Children whose mothers used hormonal birth control while nursing have been followed as late as 17 years of age. The exception to this is the very young baby  less than 6 weeks old. There may be some concern about the babys immature liver being able to metabolize the hormones passed through the milk well enough.Any hormonal birth control may cause fussiness in the baby (not reported in the literature but often anecdotally by mothers). This may be due to the hormones causing a minimal decrease in the protein/nitrogen/lactose content of the milk. Some mothers have reported marked improvement in their babys degree of fussiness once they come off hormonal birth control.Effects on mother: If you had gestational diabetes during pregnancy, talk to your doctor about the safety of using the mini-pill while breastfeeding. A 1998 study conducted at the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles (Kjos SL, et al. Contraception and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Latina women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus. JAMA. 1998 Aug 12;280(6):533-8.) indicated that for certain women, taking the mini-pill while breastfeeding may increase the risk of chronic, non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This study of more than 900 Latinas found that those who had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and then took mini-pills while breastfeeding had an almost threefold risk of developing type II diabetes within a year, compared with those who used different contraception. This study concentrated on Hispanic women, and thus it is not clear whether the results can be applied to all ethnic groups. Other, smaller studies on the mini-pill did not show any increased rates of diabetes, so more research in needed on this subject.Heres the bottom lineUse any hormonal type of birth control with caution (particularly the forms that contain estrogen).Use as low a dose as possible.If you experience supply problems (or if babys weight gain slows more than expected or stops) and are using any type of hormonal birth control, its a good idea to discontinue using it for a time and see if your supply rebounds as a resultAdditional informationBreastfeeding and Fertility (also discusses using breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy)How do I determine if a medication is safe for a breastfeeding mother?@KellyMomSafe Use of Birth Control While Breastfeeding from the InfantRisk CenterBreastfeeding Answer Book, March 2012 Update: Contraception from La Leche League InternationalEmergency hormonal contraception and Breastfeeding  The morning after pill by Wendy Jones PhD, MRPharmSGeneral information on birth control choicesManaging Contraception is the website of Dr. Hatcher, author of the excellent book Managing Contraception.FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Consistent with worldwide trends, the levels of dioxin-like compounds have decreased over a ten-year period from 1993 to 2003 by approximately 60%. It should be noted that it is the advice of the WHO and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in Australia, that breast milk is the best food for babies. Breast milk may contain low levels of dioxins because of its fat content, but all babies are exposed to dioxins even if they are not breastfed. Alternative foods for babies, such as infant formula, may also contain dioxins because they may also contain fat. Several studies around the world in areas where dioxin levels are known to be high have still shown that breastfed babies are healthier than those fed infant formula.Schreiber, J., 1997, Transport of Organic Chemicals to Breast Milk: Tetrachloroethene Case Study, Chapter 5, IN: Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology of HumanDevelopment, 1997, Taylor and Francis, Publ., Kacew and Lambert, Eds., pp. 95- 143.

Night weaning Jack,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/considering-weaning/nightweaning_jack/,"Reprinted                 with permission from the author. I just wanted to share my story as I know that                 I have learned so much from others. My son Jack, now 2 1/2, still                 nurses 3 times a day, and just last week night weaned with just                 a little encouragement from us I always planned on nursing, but never had a strong stance against                 formula and thought that I might supplement with the occasional                 bottle if we were out and about. Well, Jack had other ideas Once                 he had yummy mommy milk he wasnt about to accept anything else.                 He would never take a bottle and thus a drop of formula has never                 crossed his lips. So, although Im what I would consider a pretty modest person,                 I learned to nurse him discreetly in public. Ive nursed him everywhere-                 at restaurants, on airplanes, all over Disney World, Universal Studios,                 the beach, etc. And, I have been very lucky  Ive never had to                 endure a rude comment, pretty much only supportive looks. I feel                 for those who constantly are attacked about nursing in public! Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I exclusively nursed Jack for almost eight months, at which time                 we started him on cereal and jarred baby foods. He has always been                 nursed to sleep, we co-sleep (also not pre-planned, but this kiddo                 has a mind of his own!), and he has waked to nurse at least every                 two hours since the day he was born. I thought I would never sleep                 more than two hours straight again, but I am happy to say that just                 last week I was able to gently night wean him without any real upset. I really want to give others hope that this day will come and you                 will sleep uninterrupted again. We have tried in the past on several                 occasions to not nurse him at night and to comfort him in other                 ways, but it always resulted in him crying so much that none of                 us got any sleep  it wasnt worth the trauma! But, as hes getting older we thought wed try again and its worked                 like magic  he must have been ready. We had a big talk about his                 drinkies going night-night, because they were tired                 too, and he seemed to get it. The first night he stirred at least                 10 times, but we rubbed his back and whispered to him that the drinkies                 were sleeping, and a miracle happened  he actually fell back to                 sleep. He whimpered a tiny bit, but never for more than a minute,                 and he never really cried at all. Each night he wakes less and less                 and he still hasnt been upset about it. And this is a kid who has                 NEVER fallen asleep by himself and has always had to be nursed for                 every little awakening! So take heart  your day will come and you will sleep again! I                 would have never believed or imagined that this could have happened                 even a couple of months ago! When your little one is ready it wont                 be too difficult. Now it seems as if the past 2 1/2 years have flown by  when he                 was a baby I could never have thought I would nurse him this long,                 but I wouldnt change it for the world. I still nurse him when he                 wakes in the morning and to sleep at naptime and bedtime. He is                 a loving, kind, generous, energetic toddler and sometimes the only                 quiet time I have when him is when he is nursing! I dont see us fully weaning anytime soon  Im plenty happy to                 have my sleep at night now and I hope that when he fully weans it                 will be as painless as night weaning because he will be ready! Just cherish every little nursing moment because it truly is such                 a special bond! Dont worry about what will happen if you nurse                 your baby to sleep or at night  it will work out in the end. And,                 dont feel bad if you occasionally get so frustrated you dont think                 you can go on. There were more than a few nights that I thought                 I would go crazy if I had to nurse him one more time, but as with                 everything I tried to remember this too shall pass                  and, looking back, it really did pass quickly! I really hope that this doesnt sound too preachy, but over the                 years I have read so many posts from people having problems with                 their babies/toddlers nursing at night and kiddos that wont wean                 that I wanted to share my story to hopefully give others hope! Whenever I read about someone who successfully night weaned I thought                 that it would never happen for Jack because he is/was such a strong-willed,                 high-needs child, but Im here to say that it did! And, it will                 work out for you, too  just give it time lots and lots of time.  Ellizabeth, mom to Jack 2 1/2 yearsFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Reusing expressed breastmilk,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/milkstorage/reusing-expressedmilk/,"Q: Should breastmilk left over from a feeding be dumped immediately (like formula), or can you save it and give it to baby later?A: It is probably safe to save the left-over milk for use at the next feeding, but no published studies have investigated this issue. As a result of this lack of information, milk storage guidelines recommend that breastmilk be discarded at the end of the feeding. Lets look at the information that we do have availableStorage of left-over milk is a different issue than storage of fresh milk because bacteria from babys mouth usually enters the milk once baby begins drinking. Freshly expressed milk contains live cells which kill bacteria, and one study (Pardou et al, 1994) found that some of the milk that had been refrigerated for 8 days actually had lower bacteria levels than when the milk was first expressed. Many mothers of healthy babies have saved left-over milk for longer than two hours (sometimes as long as 24-48 hours) with no problems, but whether or not the milk is safe depends on several factors.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Fresh breastmilk has the most bacteria-fighting power, followed by refrigerated milk, then previously-frozen milk. Milk that has been frozen a shorter period of time will have more anti-infective properties than milk frozen for a longer period of time. Bacteria grows more slowly in any breastmilk than it does in formula.The cleanliness of your milk expression technique (hand washing, cleaning pump parts per manufacturer instructions, washing storage containers in hot soapy water) will also affect the amount of bacteria in the milk.If your baby is sick or has immune issues, s/he will be less able to handle normal amounts of bacteria. In this case, you will need to follow stricter guidelines.Image credit: Daniel Lobo on flickr CC BY 2.0If you do save the milk for later use, some mothers re-refrigerate the milk and others leave it at room temperature  no studies have been done, so we dont know whether one method is preferred. We do know that for any food, refrigeration slows bacteria growth. Milk storage guidelines do not include any warnings against rewarming milk, and many moms rewarm with no issues. Many moms smell (or taste) the milk to make sure it still smells fresh.Following are some quotes from various breastfeeding experts:From the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicines Clinical Protocol #8: Human Milk Storage Information for Home Use for Full-Term Infants (March 2010):Once a baby begins drinking expressed human milk, some bacterial contamination occurs in the milk from the babys mouth. The duration of time the milk can be kept at room temperature once the baby has partially fed from the cup or bottle would theoretically depend on the initial bacterial load in the milk, how long the milk has been thawed, and the ambient temperature. There have been no studies done to provide recommendations in this regard. Based on related evidence thus far, it seems reasonable to discard the remaining milk within 12 hours after the baby is finished feeding.Per Breastfeeding, A Guide for the Medical Profession (7th edition, 2011) by Ruth Lawrence, MD (p. 639):Breast milk can safely stand at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours and need not be discarded if the first feeding attempt is incomplete. In contrast, formula must be refrigerated and discarded after the first feeding attempt because it contains no antibodies or infection protection factors.Per Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple (2010) by Nancy Mohrbacher, IBCLC, FILCA (p. 462):Mothers are often told to discard any milk after a feeding because the milk mixes with the babys saliva. Although no published studies have examined the safety of keeping leftover milk, a college student researched this scenario for her unpublished senior thesis (Brusseau, 1998) The only milk with increased total bacterial counts was one batch of the warmed and fed milk from a mother who had not followed instructions and had donated previously frozen milk instead of fresh milk. All other batches showed no change in total bacterial counts within 48 hours after feeding.If my baby doesnt finish a bottle of pumped breast milk can I save it for later? by Jan Barger, R.N., M.A., IBCLC:Based on this study, which admittedly needs to be done on a larger scale, it would seem to me that expressed breast milk, fed to the baby, partially consumed, and then refrigerated, could be used for one more feeding no more than four hours later. Thats probably fairly conservative. One of the best tests of whether the milk is spoiled is to do what you do with cows milk: Smell it and taste it!Brusseau R. Bacterial Analysis of Refrigerated Human Milk Following Infant Feeding. May 1998. [This is an unpublished senior thesis.]Summary: The number of infants who are breastfed is on the rise, as is the number of women in the workforce. Many women who choose breastfeeding after returning to work, express milk during the day and store this milk for a future feeding. When infants do not finish a bottle of expressed breastmilk, doctors recommend unfinished portions be thrown away. This study examined bacterial levels in expressed, partially consumed breastmilk that was stored for 48 hours at 4-6 C. A portion of unconsumed milk was examined as a control. Samples were taken every 12 hours for bacterial analysis. Tests were performed to identify total colony counts, pathogenic Staphylococci, coliforms and b-hemolytic Streptococci. This study showed no significant difference between bottles that were partially consumed and those that were not exposed to the babys mouth for 5 out of 6 participants. All milk samples had colony counts in the acceptable range of < 105 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). Although this project provides evidence that it may be safe to refeed a child a bottle of breastmilk, due to the small sample size, further tests should be performed.With exception of participant F there was no change in total bacteria found in expressed human milk that has been partially fed to an infant Since participants E-F were showing a significantly higher amount of growth than participants A-C I examined the questionnaire to see if I could find any common factors among each group. Due to small sample size it was not possible to statistically analyze the information, but I could not find anything outstanding that participants A-C did differently from participants E-F Although I clearly specified that freshly expressed refrigerated milk was to be provided for the study, participant Fs milk was frozen The most important lesson we can learn from this data is that in spite of high bacterial levels found both control and partially consumed milk, none of the babies became ill. This provides some evidence that different standards need to be made for healthy full-term infants.More on Breastmilk Storage and HandlingFacebookPinterestTwitter"
When Baby Bites,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/biting/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCWill I need to wean when baby gets teeth?Ways to PREVENT bitingWhat do I do if baby bites me?Suggestions from other momsNot really biting, but scraping teeth or indentationsIf your baby bites you and causes damage to the nippleMore informationWill I need to wean when baby gets teeth?Many people think that when baby gets teeth and has the ability to bite, then the nursing relationship has ended and its time to wean. Not true! If your baby is nursing properly, then you should not feel teeth, even if baby has a mouthful of them. And keep in mind that its physically impossible for baby to nurse and bite at the same time, because the tongue covers the bottom teeth/gum when baby is nursing.Some babies never bite, but biting is a behavior that most babies do try, usually when they are teething. Rest assured that biting can be stopped with a little persistence on the mothers part. Biting is, for the vast majority of moms, a temporary issue that only lasts a few days to a couple of weeks.All babies are different, so you may need to try several different things before you find something that works for you. What works for you will depend on your babys age, temperament and personality.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Many mothers have gotten through this stage and gone on to give their babies the wonderful benefits of breastfeeding for weeks, months, and even years afterward.Ways to PREVENT bitingBiting at the end of a nursing session: Biting often takes place at the end of a nursing session when baby is getting bored and is no longer hungry. If you start to have a biting problem, watch for signs of boredom, and take baby from the breast before the biting starts. Also, watch for tension in babys jaw before he starts to bite down. He may also pull his tongue back from its normal position over the lower gum/teeth.When baby is teething: Biting can also be brought on by teething. If baby seems to be teething rather than wanting to nurse, offer her a teething toy or something cold to bite (instead of you). Offer baby a teething toy after a bite or near miss. When you do this, tell her, This is for biting. Be gentle when you nurse. See also these comfort measures for teething.When my oldest was teething, I could tell whether my baby felt like biting or nursing by offering her a finger (careful!) or a toy before nursing  she would either suck or bite.Biting at the beginning of a nursing session: If baby is biting at the beginning of a nursing session, make sure baby opens wide when latching on. If your teething baby is biting at the beginning of a nursing session, try giving her a teething toy or something cold to chew on before nursing. Praise baby when she latches on correctly, without biting.Distracted baby: When baby is distracted, dont force a nursing. If hes wriggling, rolling, or pushing against you with his arms, he may not be hungry or interested in nursing. Try lying down with him in a quiet room, walking or rocking. See also these tips for nursing distracted babies.Biting for attention: Focus your attention on your baby while nursing, if youre having a problem with biting. Some older babies will bite for attention. Paying attention will also help you to be aware of when baby is about to bite.Use positive reinforcement and praise for good latch on and careful unlatching. Even the youngest babies can learn to nurse properly when mom uses gentle encouragement.What do I do if baby bites me?If baby bites, it can be very effective to calmly remove baby from the breast and say nothing (or perhaps make a calm comment like oh? dont want to nurse right now?), then end the nursing session for a bit.Stopping the nursing session is generally the most effective way to teach baby that nursing and biting do not go together. Once baby lets go, remove her from the breast for a bit  it may be a few seconds or a few minutes (this is something where youll need to gauge your own babys reaction). If baby is teething (which is often the cause of biting), this is a good time to hand baby something cold to chew on, a teething toy, etc. You might tell baby something along the lines of, if you want to bite, were not nursing. If baby really wants to keep nursing, she may get upset when you end the nursing session, at which point you can wait a few moments then give baby another chance to nurse. If baby is not interested in nursing, she might fuss a few seconds but then go on to something else.If baby bites, its not a good idea to scream or yell on purpose as a method to stop biting  there are better ways to teach baby not to bite. Sometimes, of course, its impossible not to yell in pain if baby catches you by surprise and/or bites hard. Sometimes yelling does stop baby from biting again; however, some babies think its so funny that they continue to bite for the reaction, and other babies are so scared that they go on a nursing strike. The chance that this method will stop baby biting is simply not worth the problems it can cause.If your baby bites down and doesnt let go (most let go immediately without mom doing anything), there are a couple of things you can do: First, quickly place your finger between babys gums so you can pull away without (more) injury. If that doesnt work, pull baby TOWARD you, very close to your breast. This will make it a little hard to breathe, so baby will automatically let go to open her mouth more and uncover her nose to breathe. A variation of this that some moms use is to gently pinch babys nose closed for just a second to get her to open her mouth and release the nipple.Suggestions from other momsA baby cannot suck for milk and bite simultaneously. When I start to nurse my son, I watch him intently. As soon as he stops sucking, I take him off the breast and talk to him gently for a minute before I let him resume. My baby had two reasons for biting: either he was not hungry or not interested in nursing  he was distracted or bored. I switch sides during a feeding or move to a different chair or position. What worked best for me was to be very vigilant during nursing sessions  no more reading magazines or watching TV. By watching carefully, I could tell when my son was beginning to lose interest, and I could remove him from the breast. My baby begin biting when I became pregnant with my second child (even before I realized I was pregnant). Im not sure why  perhaps my milk supply had already decreased due to the pregnancy.The time when I yelled out in pain, it scared my daughter pretty badly (though not into a nursing strike). The few times that she bit after that, I just gritted my teeth and calmly said no bite  that hurts Mama! When my son tried biting, I found it was just as effective to say nothing (or perhaps make a calm comment like oh? dont want to nurse right now?), then calmly remove him from the breast for a bit.Be sure you dont use any teething gels or lotions just prior to breastfeeding, since it can numb the babys tongue, and even your nipple & areola, making it difficult for baby to breastfeed. If you think your baby may have pain from the teething ask your doctor about using a baby pain reliever (like Tylenol) 1/2 hour before nursing. Not really biting, but scraping teeth or indentationsTeeth scraping, uncomfortable latch, or indentations on your nipple tissue from the teeth is not all that uncommon. It seems to be worse for most moms right when the teeth first cut through, and before they have a chance to wear down some and become less sharp. Babies may also change their latch a bit when they get new teeth, as nursing can feel different to them with the new teeth. With time, baby will learn to nurse better with the new teeth and you wont be so aware of them. Here are some suggestions that have helped other moms:With an older baby, the weight of the baby can cause babys mouth and teeth to drag down on the breast tissue. See if you can position baby so that her weight is supported well. Use pillows or a chair with arm rests to support her as much as you can. When she is nursing on the left side, bring her bottom in a little bit closer and vice versa. Dont let her nurse in a position that lets her weight and gravity cause her mouth to pull down on your breast and nipple. Try moving her body slightly in different ways (higher, lower, side to side, etc.) till the pressure on your breast is lessened.Latch baby on and position her head so that it is tilted back more to get the pressure of the top teeth off your breast. For example, if baby is nursing in the cradle position on the left side, bring her body toward the right a bit. This will bring babys chin up, with her head a bit cocked back, and that moves the pressure of babys top teeth off the top of the nipple. Dont let her chin rest on her chest.Some other ways to get babys head tilted back more: ask your child to look at you while she nurses, or hold a book up high to read to your child and have her look at the book.When you support your breast with 2-4 fingers underneath and thumb on top, push in against the chest wall with your index finger just before offering the breast. This will cause the nipple and areola to point down more, so that they dont rub against babys upper teeth. This technique is often suggested for moms who have nipple soreness due to their nipples rubbing up against the roof of babys mouth.Ask baby to open WIDE and show her with your own mouth. Tell her that it hurts mommy and ask her to try again until it feels better.A generous application of lanolin before and after feeding may be helpful, as will rinsing your nipples with cool water after feedings. When babies are teething they produce more saliva which can be irritating to nipple tissue. If baby is eating solids, sometimes food particles left in the mouth can also irritate nipple tissue, so it may help to rinse out babys mouth or give baby a sip of water prior to nursing.Any time you experience soreness, go back to the basics of latch just as you did in the early days.Its also possible that some of the tenderness is a result of ovulation or an impending menstrual period. Many moms of older babies are more bothered with latch on and babys teeth during these times.See also: Toddler Tips: Uncomfortable Latch from the LLLI websiteIf your baby bites you and causes damage to the nippleIt never happens to most moms, but occasionally a mom will get a bad bite from baby. Applying ice right after the injury and between feedings can be very helpful. Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) are compatible with breastfeeding and can be used as needed.

Nipple blanching and vasospasm,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/nipple-blanching/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCNipple blanching (turning white) after a feeding occurs when the blood flow to the nipple is limited or cut off. Blanching is most often related to latch problems. Nipple blanching is often, but not always, associated with pain. Because women may describe shooting, burning breast/nipple pain, this can be mistakenly diagnosed as thrush. If the normal color returns after your baby has finished a feeding and there is no pain, then the blanching is not a problem.Compression blanching | Vasospasm | Treatment options | ResourcesBlanching due to compressionThe most common reason for nipple blanching is that that baby is compressing the nipple while nursing. This can be due to:a shallow latch (the most common problem)improper suckingbaby clamping down to slow a too-fast let-downtongue-tiebaby clamping due to allergiesclampdown bite reflexpalate variations, etc.When blanching is due to babys compression of the nipple, the nipple is white and often misformed (flattened, creased, pointed, etc.) immediately upon coming out of babys mouth. There may be a white stripe across the nipple directly after nursing. Pain may not start until a few seconds to a few minutes after nursing, as the circulation returns to the nipple. If you are experiencing pain with the blanching, then finding and remedying the underlying cause will also eliminate the blanching.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Blanching due to vasospasmVasospasm, which is more severe, is a sudden constriction/narrowing of a blood vessel (in the nipple, in this case) that is extremely painful. It might occur a short time after nursing or in between nursings. Vasospasm can have various causes:Vasospasm can be a secondary response to pain or nipple trauma  (damaged nipples or thrush). In this case, the nipple(s) turns white shortly after nursing (rather than coming out of babys mouth white and misformed). Mom might notice a white circle on the face of the nipple a few seconds to a few minutes after breastfeeding. Cold often triggers the vasospasm and/or makes it worse. Unlike blanching due to compression, latch and positioning may be fine if the source of any nipple damage has already been fixed. Healing the nipple trauma or other source of pain should eliminate the vasospasms, although they may persist for a short time after the nipple has healed (previously damaged tissue can remain sensitive for a time).Raynauds of the nippleVasospasm can also be caused by Raynauds Phenomenon (more info here), which causes sudden vasospasms in the extremities. When nipple vasospasm is caused by Raynauds Phenomenon (Raynauds of the nipple), the nipple turns white, then there is usually a noticeable triphasic color change  from white to blue to red  as blood flow returns. The color change may also be biphasic  from white to blue.Vasospasm due to Raynauds is more likely to occur on both sides (rather than just one nipple), lasts for relatively long periods of time (rather than for a few seconds or a few minutes), and can occur during pregnancy and/or at times unrelated to feeding. Vasospasms may also occur in fingers or toes. Cold typically triggers the vasospasm and/or makes it worse. Nipple trauma (and other causes of compression blanching or vasospasm) can exacerbate the problem. Raynauds phenomenon may recur with subsequent pregnancies/breastfeeding, so be prepared to seek treatment quickly if you have experienced this in the past.Per Anderson et al, Because the breast pain associated with Raynauds phenomenon is so severe and throbbing, it is often mistaken for Candida albicans [yeast] infection. It is not unusual for mothers who have Raynauds phenomenon of the nipple to be treated inappropriately and often repeatedly for C albicans infections with topical or systemic antifungal agents.Keep in mind that Raynauds is not caused by breastfeeding (anyone might have it)  it simply has the potential to affect breastfeeding. For example, any person might have inverted nipples, which might or might not affect a mothers breastfeeding relationship (as this can make latching or sore nipples more of a challenge in the beginning). Raynauds works the same way  anyone might have it coming into breastfeeding, and it might (or might not) affect the breastfeeding relationship if the vasospasms are triggered by bad latch, a sudden temperature change as baby unlatches, etc.Some maternal medications have been associated with vasospasm, including oral contraceptives containing estrogen. Fibromyalgia, rheumatologic diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis), endocrine diseases (eg, hypothyroidism or carcinoid), and prior breast surgery have also been associated with Raynauds phenomenon. Some sources indicate that the antifungal medication fluconazole may be associated with vasospasm, although the manufacturer does not report this as a known complication of fluconazole use. Other sources feel that vasospasms experienced by mothers taking fluconazole are a result of nipple pain/trauma due to thrush (and not due to the medication used to treat the thrush).Treatment options for vasospasmAvoid cold. Apply dry heat to the breast when needed (this relaxes the cramping blood vessels). Some mothers benefit from keeping the entire body warm (warm clothing, warm room, wrap up in a blanket, etc.)Cover the nipple as soon as possible after baby comes off the breast. Some moms say that it is helpful use a wool breast pad or a soft cloth diaper.Apply dry heat immediately after breastfeeding. A rice sock can be useful as a source of dry heat: Fill a sock or a cloth bag with uncooked rice and microwave 45 seconds (or until desired warmth is achieved); hold the rice sock against the nipple (over the cloth or moms shirt) until blood flow resumes.Massage the nipple with olive oil when mom is feeling pain from the vasospasm.Avoid caffeine, nicotine/smoking, diet pills, cold medications containing pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, beta blockers, and other vasoconstrictive drugs, as they can precipitate symptoms. Oral contraceptives containing estrogen have also been associated with vasospasm.Medications and dietary supplements may also be helpful:Ibuprofen.Dietary supplementation with calcium/magnesium.Dietary supplementation with a vitamin B complex that includes B6 and niacin.Dietary supplementation with fish oil supplements.Low dose oral nifedipine.See links below for additional details.Additional information and referencesNipple pain  links @ Clampdown Bite Reflex by Mary Jozwiak, from Leaven, Vol. 30 No. 4, July-August 1994, pp. 53-4.Vasospasm and Raynauds Phenomenon by Jack Newman, MDNipple Vasospasm and Breastfeeding byPhilippa Pearson-Glaze IBCLCSeeking Relief by Debbie Granick, from New Beginnings, Vol. 16 No. 3,July-August 1999, p. 120.Patient information: Raynaud phenomenon (Beyond the Basics)by Fredrick M Wigley, MDReferencesAnderson JE, Held N, Wright K.

My baby is fussy! Is something wrong?,http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/fussybaby/,"What is normal baby fussiness? Lsantilli  Fotolia.comWhether breastfed or formula fed, during their first few months, many babies have a regular fussy period, which usually occurs in the late afternoon or evening. Some babies fussy periods come so regularly that parents can set their clocks by it! The standard infant fussiness usually starts at about 2 to 3 weeks, peaks at 6 weeks and is gone by 3 to 4 months. It lasts on average 2 to 4 hours per day. Of course, there is a wide variety of normal.To distinguish between normal and a problem, normal usually occurs around the same time of day, with approximately the same intensity (with some variation); responds to some of the same things each time, such as motion, holding, frequent breastfeeding, etc.; and occurs in a baby who has other times of the day that he is contentedly awake or asleep. Normal fussiness tends to occur during the time of the day that the baby usually stays awake more, the most common time is in the evening right before the time that the baby takes his longest stretch of sleep.What causes babies to be fussy?If you feel that your babys fussiness is not normal, its never a bad idea to get baby checked by the doctor to rule out any illness. A common cause of fussy, colic-like symptoms in babies is foremilk-hindmilk imbalance (also called oversupply syndrome, too much milk, etc.) and/or forceful let-down. Other causes of fussiness in babies include diaper rash, thrush, food sensitivities, nipple confusion, low milk supply, etc.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Babies normally fuss for many reasons: overtiredness, overstimulation, loneliness, discomfort, etc. Babies are often very fussy when they are going through growth spurts. Do know that it is normal for you to be beside yourself when your baby cries: you actually have a hormonal response that makes you feel uncomfortable when your baby cries.Comfort measures for fussy babies(many fit into several different categories)Basic needsNurseBurp babyChange his diaperUndress baby completely to make sure no clothing is sticking himComforting TouchHold babyCarry baby in a sling, wrap,or other soft carrierGive baby a back rubCarry baby in the colic hold (lying across your forearm, tummy down, with your hand supporting his chest)Lay baby across your lap & gently rub his back while slowly lifting & lowering your heelsLay baby tummy-down on the bed or floor and gently pat his backMassage your babyReduce stimulationSwaddle babyDim lights and reduce noiseComforting SoundsPlay some music (try different styles and types of voices to see which baby prefers)Sing to babyTurn on some white noise (fan, vacuum cleaner, dishwasher)Rhythmic motion / change of paceNurse baby in motion (while walking around or rocking)Give baby a bathRock babyHold baby and gently bounce, sway back and forth or dancePut baby in a sling or baby carrier and walk around inside or outsidePut baby in a baby swing (if hes old enough)Take baby outside to look at the treesTake baby for a walk in the strollerGo for a car rideSet baby in a baby carrier (or car seat) on the dryer with the dryer turned on (stand by him, as the vibration can bounce the seat right off the dryer onto the floor)One of the most interesting things Ive seen in the research regarding infant fussiness is that almost anything a parent tries to reduce fussiness will work, but only for a short time (a few days), and then other strategies need to be used.If you nurse and it doesnt seem to help, then try other comfort measures. If you pick him up or nurse him, and baby is content, then that was what he needed. If it works, use it!Im worried about spoiling my babyYour baby will not be spoiled if you hold him and nurse him often  quite the opposite, in fact. Studies have shown that when babies are held often and responded to quickly, the babies cry less, and the parents learn to read babys cues more quickly. A young childs need for his mother is very intense  as intense as his need for food. Know that your child really needs you. It is not about manipulation or something you can fix with the right discipline. Often a baby who is perceived as fussy is simply a baby who needs more contact with mom (and is smart enough to express this need) and is content once his needs are met. See the links below to read more about spoiling.ConclusionCaring for a fussy baby can be very stressful! Give both yourself and baby some extra TLC. Surround yourself with supportive people, de-stress in other areas if possible (for example, minimize housework), and tell yourself you are doing a great job. It is very difficult to feel good about yourself as a parent when you have a fussy baby. Dont be too alarmed if your efforts seem to have no positive effect  they are. When you stay with your baby to try to provide comfort you are beginning to teach your baby that he can count on you and that he is loved.Additional Resources@ Cluster Feeding and Fussy EveningsMy baby fusses or cries during nursing  whats the problem?Growth spurtsNursing to Sleep and other Comfort NursingIs your baby nursing all the time?My baby is gassy.

What causes blood in baby’s stool?,http://kellymom.com/health/baby-health/bloodystool/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCMany cases of blood in infant stools have no known cause. If the baby is otherwise well and growing, blood in the stool often resolves on its own, but this should always be checked out by babys doctor.The color of the blood gives you a clue about where it originated. Blood originating in the colon or rectum tends to be red and may only streak the outside of the stool. If the blood originates further up the GI tract, then the blood is generally darker in color (dark brown/maroon, black) and mixed throughout the stool instead of just on the outside.Some potential causes of blood in babys stools:A common cause of blood in an infants stool is a slight anal tear (fissure) from baby straining with the passage of the stool. The small amount of blood from an anal fissure tends to look like a red streak on the outside of the stool.Another common cause of blood in the stools of infants is food allergies. The top allergens are cows milk products and soy. See Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies for more information.A third common cause: If mom has a  cracked nipple or other bleeding, then baby may ingest some blood from mom (this is not harmful to baby), which may show up in babys stool.Occasionally, blood in the stool may be due to breastmilk oversupply. Per Dr. Jack Newman, bloody stools in some babies have been eliminated completely by resolving moms oversupply. This can be done by following the usual management procedures for oversupply; it can also be helpful to use breast compressions to increase the amount of fat that baby gets while nursing.There are several case reports of a baby beginning to have mucous and/or blood in the stool after starting vitamin/fluoride drops, where the blood disappeared after the drops were discontinued.Blood in the stool may also be caused by a temporary case of lactose intolerance, due to an intestinal infection.Certain kinds of infectious diarrhea can cause bloody stools in babies, including Salmonella and C. Difficile. C. Difficile is a bacteria that grows in the gut if the bacterial balance has been upset; the toxin can cause injury to the mucosa and bloody stools. Breastfed babies tend to have less severe symptoms than non-breastfed babies because breastmilk inhibits the growth of the bacteria.Various forms of colitis, intussusception, or other intestinal disorders are other possible causes.Does blood in the stool require a trip to the emergency room?You should always talk to babys doctor if there is blood in babys stool, but whether or not this requires an emergency visit would depend upon your childs behavior. If baby is happy and seems healthy, then call your doctor to make an appointment. If baby is experiencing abdominal pain, significant bleeding in the stool, diarrhea, vomiting, and/or fever, then more urgent medical care is indicated. Per Dr. Jay Gordon, Persistent or increasing blood in the stool or blood mixed with mucus (described as currant jelly stool in the texts) requires an immediate call to your doctor.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Additional InformationJournal articles on this subjectAllergic Proctocolitis in the Exclusively Breastfed Infant.

Growth spurts,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/growth-spurts/,"duron12345 - Fotolia.comMost babies go through several growth spurts (also called frequency days) during the first 12 months.What is a growth spurt?During a growth spurt, breastfed babies nurse more often than usual (sometimes as often as every hour) and often act fussier than usual.The increase in babys milk intake during growth spurts is temporary. In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months. As solids are gradually introduced after six months, babys milk intake will gradually decrease.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Physical growth is not the only reason that babies may have a temporary need for increased nursing. Babies often exhibit the same type of behavior (increased nursing with or without increased fussiness) when they are working on developmental advances such as rolling over, crawling, walking or talking. Moms milk is for growing the brain as well as the body!When do babies have growth spurts?Common times for growth spurts are during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). Babies dont read calendars, however, so your baby may do things differently.Growth spurts dont stop after the first year  most moms notice growth spurts every few months during the toddler years and periodically thereafter on through the teenage years.How long do growth spurts last?Growth spurts usually last 2-3 days, but sometimes last a week or so.What is the best way to handle a growth spurt?Follow your childs lead. Baby will automatically get more milk by nursing more frequently, and your milk supply will increase due to the increased nursing. It is not necessary (or advised) to supplement your baby with formula or expressed milk during a growth spurt. Supplementing (and/or scheduling feeds) interferes with the natural supply and demand of milk production and will prevent your body from getting the message to make more milk during the growth spurt.Some nursing moms feel more hungry or thirsty when baby is going through a growth spurt. Listen to your body  you may need to eat or drink more during the time that baby is nursing more often.See My baby is fussy!

How does milk production work?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/milkproduction/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCTo understand how to effectively increase (or decrease) milk supply, we need to look at how milk production worksFor the most part, milk production is a use it or lose it process. The more often and effectively your baby nurses, the more milk you will make.In the BeginningEstablished LactationWhat does current research tell us about milk production?Feedback Inhibitor of LactationProlactin receptorsWhat drives milk synthesis?Storage capacityWhat does the research tell us about increasing milk supply?Additional informationReferencesIn the BeginningEndocrine (Hormonal) Control of Milk Synthesis  Lactogenesis I & IIMilk production doesnt start out as a supply and demand process. During pregnancy and the first few days postpartum, milk supply is hormonally driven  this is called the endocrine control system. Essentially, as long as the proper hormones are in place, mom will start making colostrum about halfway through pregnancy (Lactogenesis I) and her milk will increase in volume (Lactogenesis II) around 30-40 hours after birth.During the latter part of pregnancy, the breasts are making colostrum, but high levels of progesterone inhibit milk secretion and keep the volume turned down. At birth, the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone/estrogen/HPL levels. This abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels cues Lactogenesis II (copious milk production). Other hormones (insulin, thyroxine, cortisol) are also involved, but their roles are not yet well understood. Although biochemical markers indicate that Lactogenesis II commences approximately 30-40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk coming in) until 50-73 hours (2-3 days) after birth.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.These first two stages of lactation are hormonally driven  they occur whether or not a mother is breastfeeding her baby.Established LactationAutocrine (Local) Control of Milk Synthesis  Lactogenesis IIIAfter Lactogenesis II, there is a switch to the autocrine (or local) control system. This maintenance stage of milk production is also called Lactogenesis III. In the maintenance stage, milk synthesis is controlled at the breast  milk removal is the primary control mechanism for supply. Milk removal is driven by babys appetite. Although hormonal problems can still interfere with milk supply, hormonal levels play a much lesser role in established lactation. Under normal circumstances, the breasts will continue to make milk indefinitely as long as milk removal continues.By understanding how local/autocrine control of milk synthesis works, we can gain an understanding of how to effectively increase (or decrease) milk supply.What does current research tell us about milk production?Current research suggests that there are two factors that control milk synthesis:Milk contains a small whey protein called Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation (FIL)  the role of FIL appears to be to slow milk synthesis when the breast is full. Thus milk production slows when milk accumulates in the breast (and more FIL is present), and speeds up when the breast is emptier (and less FIL is present).The hormone prolactin must be present for milk synthesis to occur. On the walls of the lactocytes (milk-producing cells of the alveoli) are prolactin receptor sites that allow the prolactin in the blood stream to move into the lactocytes and stimulate the synthesis of breastmilk components. When the alveolus is full of milk, the walls expand/stretch and alter the shape of prolactin receptors so that prolactin cannot enter via those receptor sites  thus rate of milk synthesis decreases. As milk empties from the alveolus, increasing numbers of prolactin receptors return to their normal shape and allow prolactin to pass through  thus rate of milk synthesis increases. The prolactin receptor theory suggests that frequent milk removal in the early weeks will increase the number of receptor sites. More receptor sites means that more prolactin can pass into the lactocytes and thus milk production capability would be increased.Both of the above factors support research findings that tell us:FULLBreast = SLOWERMilkProductionEMPTYBreast = FASTERMilkProductionResearch indicates that fat content of the milk is also determined by how empty the breast is (emptier breast = higher fat milk), rather than by the time of day or stage of the feed.How does milk supply vary throughout the day?Earlier researchers observed that milk volume is typically greater in the morning hours (a good time to pump if you need to store milk), and falls gradually as the day progresses. Fat content tends to increase as the day progresses (Hurgoiu V, 1985). These observations are consistent with current research if we assume the researchers were observing babies with a fairly typical nursing pattern, where baby has a longer sleep period at night and gradually decreases the amount of time between nursing as the day progresses.Storage capacity: Another factor that affects milk production and breastfeeding management is moms milk storage capacity. Storage capacity is the amount of milk that the breast can store between feedings. This can vary widely from mom to mom and also between breasts for the same mom. Storage capacity is not determined by breast size, although breast size can certainly limit the amount of milk that can be stored. Moms with large or small storage capacities can produce plenty of milk for baby. A mother with a larger milk storage capacity may be able to go longer between feedings without impacting milk supply and babys growth. A mother with a smaller storage capacity, however, will need to nurse baby more often to satisfy babys appetite and maintain milk supply since her breasts will become full (slowing production) more quickly. Think of storage capacity as a cup  you can easily drink a large amount of water throughout the day using any size of cup  small, medium or large  but if you use a smaller cup it will be refilled more often.What does the research tell us about increasing milk supply?Milk is being produced at all times, with speed of production depending upon how empty the breast is. Milk collects in moms breasts between feedings, so the amount of milk stored in the breast between feedings is greater when more time has passed since the last feed. The more milk in the breast, the slower the speed of milk production.To speed milk synthesis and increase daily milk production, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this quickly and frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings:EMPTYBreast = FASTERMilkProductionIn practice, this means that a mother who wishes to increase milk supply should aim to keep the breasts as empty as possible throughout the day.To accomplish this goal and increase milk production:Empty the breasts more frequently (by nursing more often and/or adding pumping sessions between nursing sessions)Empty the breasts as thoroughly as possible at each nursing/pumping session.To better empty the breasts:Make sure baby is nursing efficiently.Use breast massage and compression.Offer both sides at each nursing; wait until baby is finished with the first side before offering the second. Switch nursing may be helpful if baby is not draining the breast well.Pump after nursing if baby does not adequately soften both breasts. If baby empties the breasts well, then pumping is more useful if done between nursing sessions (in light of our goal to keep the breasts as empty as possible). Are you having problems with oversupply?Mothers who are working to remedy oversupply usually need to decrease supply without decreasing overall nursing frequency or weaning baby. One way to accomplish this is by block nursing  mom nurses baby as frequently as usual but restricts baby to one breast for a set period of time (often 3-4 hours but sometimes longer) before switching sides. In this way, more milk accumulates in the breast before mom switches sides (thus slowing milk production) but babys nursing frequency is not limited.See also:Frequently Asked Questions about Milk ProductionIm confused about foremilk and hindmilk  how does this work?Anatomy of the human breast.

Increasing Low Milk Supply,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/low-supply/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCImage credit: koadmunkee on flickrIs your milk supply really low?First of all, is your milk supply really low? Often, mothers think that their milk supply is low when it really isnt. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then you do not have a problem with milk supply.Its important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.What if youre not quite sure about babys current weight gain (perhaps baby hasnt had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Dont offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesnt need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.Your baby doesnt nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day  often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the reason.Your baby guzzles down a bottle of formula or expressed milk after nursing. Many babies will willingly take a bottle even after they have a full feeding at the breast. Read more here from board-certified lactation consultant Kathy Kuhn about why baby may do this and how this can affect milk supply. Of course, if you regularly supplement baby after nursing, your milk supply will drop (see below).Your breasts dont leak milk, or only leak a little, or stop leaking. Leaking has nothing to do with your milk supply. It often stops after your milk supply has adjusted to your babys needs.Your breasts suddenly seem softer. Again, this normally happens after your milk supply has adjusted to your babys needs.You never feel a let-down sensation, or it doesnt seem as strong as before. Some women never feel a let-down. This has nothing to do with milk supply.You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time.See also Is my baby getting enough milk?Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Who to contact if you suspect low milk supplyIf youre concerned about your milk supply, it will be very helpful to get in touch with a trained breastfeeding counselor or a board certified lactation consultant. If your baby is not gaining weight or is losing weight, you need to keep in close contact with her doctor, since its possible that a medical condition can cause this. Supplementing may be medically necessary for babies who are losing weight until your milk supply increases. If supplementing is medically necessary, the best thing to supplement your baby with is your own pumped milk.Potential causes of low milk supplyThese things can cause or contribute to a low milk supply:Supplementing. Nursing is a supply & demand process. Milk is produced as your baby nurses, and the amount that she nurses lets your body know how much milk is required. Every bottle (of formula, juice or water) that your baby gets means that your body gets the signal to produce that much less milk.Bottle preference. A bottle requires a different type of sucking than nursing, and it is easier for your baby to extract milk from a bottle. As a result, giving a bottle can either cause your baby to have problems sucking properly at the breast, or can result in baby preferring the constant faster flow of the bottle.Pacifiers. Pacifiers can affect babys latch. They can also significantly reduce the amount of time your baby spends at the breast, which may cause your milk supply to drop.Nipple shields can be a useful tool in some cases, but hey can also reduce the stimulation to your nipple or interfere with milk transfer, which can interfere with the supply-demand cycle.Scheduled feedings interfere with the supply & demand cycle of milk production and can lead to a reduced supply, sometimes several months later rather than immediately. Nurse your baby whenever she is hungry.Sleepy baby. For the first few weeks, some babies are very sleepy and only ask to nurse infrequently and for short periods. Until baby wakes up and begins to breastfeed well, nurse baby at least every two hours during the day and at least every 4 hours at night to establish your milk supply.Cutting short the length of nursings. Stopping a feeding before your baby ends the feeding herself can interfere with the supply-demand cycle. Also, your milk increases in fat content later into a feeding, which helps baby gain weight and last longer between feedings.Offering only one breast per feeding. This is fine if your milk supply is well-established and your baby is gaining weight well. If youre trying to increase your milk supply, let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.Health or anatomical problems with baby (including, jaundice, tongue-tie, etc.)can prevent baby from removing milk adequately from the breast, thus decreasing milk supply.Moms health (uncontrolled anemia or hypothyroidism, retained placenta, postpartum hemorrhage), previous breast surgery/injury, hormonal problems (e.g. PCOS), anatomical problems, medications she is taking (hormonal birth control, sudafed), or smoking also have the potential to affect milk supply.Increasing your milk supplyMilk production is a demand & supply process. If you need to increase milk supply, its important to understand how milk is made  understanding this will help you to do the right things to increase production.To speed milk production and increase overall milk supply, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings.OK, now on to things that can help increase your milk supply:Make sure that baby is nursing efficiently. This is the remove more milk part of increasing milk production. If milk is not effectively removed from the breast, then moms milk supply decreases. If positioning and latch are off then baby is probably not transferring milk efficiently. A sleepy baby, use of nipple shields or various health or anatomical problems in baby can also interfere with babys ability to transfer milk. For a baby who is not nursing efficiently, trying to adequately empty milk from the breast is like trying to empty a swimming pool through a drinking straw  it can take forever. Inefficient milk transfer can lead to baby not getting enough milk or needing to nurse almost constantly to get enough milk. If baby is not transferring milk well, then it is important for mom to express milk after and/or between nursings to maintain milk supply while the breastfeeding problems are being addressed.Nurse frequently, and for as long as your baby is actively nursing. Remember  you want to remove more milk from the breasts and do this frequently. If baby is having weight gain problems, aim to nurse at least every 1.5-2 hours during the day and at least every 3 hours at night.Take a nursing vacation. Take baby to bed with you for 2-3 days, and do nothing but nurse (frequently!) and rest (well, you can eat too!).Offer both sides at each feeding. Let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.Switch nurse. Switch sides 3 or more times during each feeding, every time that baby falls asleep, switches to comfort sucking, or loses interest. Use each side at least twice per feeding. Use breast compression to keep baby feeding longer. For good instructions on how to do this, see Dr. Jack Newmans Protocol to manage breastmilk intake. This can be particularly helpful for sleepy or distractible babies.Avoid pacifiers and bottles when possible. All of babys sucking needs should be met at the breast (see above). If a temporary supplement is medically required, it can be given with a nursing supplementer or by spoon, cup or dropper (see Alternative Feeding Methods).Give baby only breastmilk. Avoid all solids, water, and formula if baby is younger than six months, and consider decreasing solids if baby is older. If you are using more than a few ounces of formula per day, wean from the supplements gradually to challenge your breasts to produce more milk.Take care of mom. Rest. Sleep when baby sleeps. Relax. Drink liquids to thirst (dont force liquids  drinking extra water does not increase supply), and eat a reasonably well-balanced diet.Consider pumping. Adding pumping sessions after or between nursing sessions can be very helpful  pumping is very important when baby is not nursing efficiently or frequently enough, and can speed things up in all situations. Your aim in pumping is to remove more milk from the breasts and/or to increase frequency of breast emptying. When pumping to increase milk supply, to ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. However, adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency but perhaps not removing milk thoroughly) is helpful.Consider a galactagogue. A substance (herb, prescription medication, etc.) that increases milk supply is called a galactagogue. See What is a galactagogue? Do I need one? for more information.Additional information@ How does milk production work?My breasts feel empty!

When God Created Moms,http://kellymom.com/fun/wisdom/god-created-moms/,"by                 Erma Bombecksee also: When                 God Created FathersWhen the good Lord was creating mothers,   He was into His sixth day of overtime, when an angel appeared and                 said, Youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one.And the Lord said, Have you read the spec on this one? She                 has to be completely washable, but not plastic; have 180 moveable                 parts, all replaceable; run on black coffee and leftovers; have                 a lap that disappears when she stands up; a kiss that can cure anything                 from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair; and six pair of                 hands.The angel shook her head slowly and said, Six pairs of handsno                 way. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Its not the hands that are causing me problems, said                 the Lord. Its the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to                 have.Thats on the standard model? asked the angel. The                 Lord nodded.One pair that sees through closed doors when she asks, What                 are you kids doing in there? when she already knows. Another                 here, in the back of her head that sees what she shouldnt, but                 what she has to know, and of course the ones here in front that                 can look at a child when he goofs up and say, I understand                 and I love you, without so much as uttering a word.Lord, said the angel, touching his sleeve gently, Rest                 for now. TomorrowI cant, said the Lord. Im so close to creating                 something close to myself. Already I have one who heals herself                 when she is sick, can feed a family of six on one pound of hamburger                 and can get a nine year old to stand under a shower.The angel circled the model of the mother very slowly. Shes                 too soft, she sighed. But tough! said the Lord excitedly. You cannot                 imagine what the mother can do or endure.Can she think?Not only think, but she can reason and compromise,                 said the Creator.Finally the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek.                 Theres a leak, she pronounced. I told you, you                 were trying to put too much into this model.Its not a leak, said the Lord. Its a tear.Whats it for?Its for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain, loneliness and                 pride.Youre a genius, said the angel.The Lord looked somber. I didnt put it there.When God Created FathersWhen the good Lord was creating Fathers he started with a tall                 frame. And a female angel nearby said, What kind of Father                 is that? If youre going to make children so close to the ground,                 why have you put fathers up so high? He wont be able to shoot marbles                 without kneeling, tuck a child in bed without bending, or even kiss                 a child without a lot of stooping. And God smiled and said, Yes, but if I make him child size,                 who would children have to look up to? And when God made a Fathers hands, they were large and sinewy.                 And the angel shook her head sadly and said, Do you know what                 youre doing? Large hands are clumsy. They cant manage diaper pins,                 small buttons, rubber bands on pony tails or even remove splinters                 caused by baseball bats. And God smiled and said, I know, but theyre large enough                 to hold everything a small boy empties from his pockets at the end                 of a dayyet small enough to cup a childs face in his hands. And then God moulded long, slim legs and broad shoulders. And the                 angel nearly had a heart attack. Boy, this is the end of the                 week, all right, she clucked. Do you realize you just                 made a Father without a lap? How is he going to pull a child close                 to him without the kid falling between his legs? And God smiled and said, A mother needs a lap. A father needs                 strong shoulders to pull a sled, balance a boy on a bicycle, and                 hold a sleepy head on the way home from the circus. God was in the middle of creating two of the largest feet anyone                 had every seen when the angel could contain herself no longer. Thats                 not fair. Do you honestly think those large boats are going to dig                 out of bed early in the morning when the baby cries? Or walk through                 a small birthday party without crushing at least three of the guests? And God smiled and said, Theyll work. Youll see. Theyll                 support a small child who wants to ride a horse to Banbury Cross,                 or scare off mice at the summer cabin, or display shoes that will                 be a challenge to fill. God worked throughout the night, giving the Father few words, but                 a firm authoritative voice; eyes that saw everything, but remained                 calm and tolerant. Finally, almost as an afterthought, he added                 tears. Then he turned to the angel and said, Now, are you                 satisfied that he can love as much as a Mother? The angel shutteth up.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding and Thyroid Problems: Diagnostic Testing & Treatments,http://kellymom.com/health/mom-health/thyroid-treatment/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCThyroid screen (blood test)Thyroid medicationsAnti-thyroid medicationsOther medicationsUltrasoundFine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsyThyroidectomyThyroid ScanRadioactive iodine (RAI) Uptake ScanRadioactive iodine treatment (RAI)Following are various diagnostic tests and treatments that moms with thyroid problems might encounter. The information summarized below is only a general overview. For detailed information, please review the references listed below with your health care provider.Thyroid screenThis is a blood test that checks thyroid function. Blood tests are compatible with breastfeeding. Tests may include:TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone, produced by the pituitary gland)total T4 (thyroxine, a thyroid hormone) and/or free T4total T3 (triiodothyronine, a thyroid hormone) and/or free T3Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)Thyroid Stimulating Antibodies (TSAb)Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI)Thyroid medicationslevothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl) synthetic T4 hormone (1)liothyronine (Cytomel) synthetic T3 hormonecombination of T3 & T4 (Thyrolar/Liotrix, Armour Thyroid)Info on selected thyroid medsName of medicationLactation Risk Category**NotesLevothyroxine (T4)L1 (safest)(1)Liothyronine (T3)L2 (safer)(2)** Per Medications and Mothers Milk by Thomas Hale, PhD (2014 edition).(1) Most studies indicate that minimal levels of maternal thyroid are transferred into human milk, and further, that the amount secreted in extremely low and insufficient to protect a hypothyroid infant even when nursing it is generally recognized that some thyroxine will transfer but the amount will be extremely low (Hale 2014, p. 649-50)Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.(2) From these studies it is apparent that only exceedingly low levels of T3 are secreted into human milk and are insufficient to protect an infant from hypothyroidism. (Hale 2014, p. 657-58)Anti-thyroid medicationscarbimazole (Neo-Mercazole)methimazole (Tapazole)propylthiouracil (PTU)Info on selected anti-thyroid medsName of medicationLactation Risk Category**Notescarbimazole (Neo-Mercazole)L2 (safer)(1)methimazole (Tapazole)L2 (safer)(2)propylthiouracil (PTU)L2 (safer)(3)** Per Medications and Mothers Milk by Thomas Hale, PhD (2014 edition).(1) Carbimazole is a prodrug and is rapidly converted to methimazole. (Hale 2014, p. 723-24)(2) Levels of methimazole in milk depend on the maternal dose but appear too low to produce clinical effects. (Hale 2014, p. 723-24)(3) Only small amounts are secreted into breastmilk. Reports thus far suggest that levels absorbed by infant are too low to produce side effects No changes in infant thyroid have been reported PTU is the best of antithyroid medications for use in lactating mothers. Monitor infant thyroid function (T4, TSH) carefully during therapy. (Hale 2014, p. 920)Im not hyperthyroid myself, but my sister was diagnosed with Graves disease after her first child was born. She breastfed her children while taking anti-thyroid meds for her hyperthyroidism.Other medicationsSome moms with hyperthyroidism are also prescribed beta-blockers (such as Propranolol/Inderal) or calcium channel blockers to relieve the neurological and cardiovascular symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Many of these drugs (including Propranolol/Inderal) are considered to be acceptable for use in breastfeeding mothers.UltrasoundUltrasound is compatible with breastfeeding.Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsyThis procedure is compatible with breastfeeding.You dont need to stop nursing for a fine needle biopsy. Its a bit scary to think of (at least it was for me!), but it doesnt really hurt at all (about like having blood drawn from your arm) and it just takes a few minutes. Ive had 2 fine needle biopsies and the second was so much easier since I know what to expect.ThyroidectomyIn this surgery, all or part of the thyroid is removed. Mom can resume breastfeeding as soon after the surgery as she feels up to holding baby.See also Breastfeeding when mom has surgery.I had thyroid surgery (a partial thyroidectomy for what turned out to be a benign cold nodule) about a year before my daughter was born, so I was not breastfeeding at the time. As I recall, I was really uncomfortable the day of the surgery, but it got better pretty quickly after that. My neck muscles were sore for weeks  it might take a little creative positioning to help you to breastfeed comfortably. You might want to take a nursing pillow to the hospital to raise baby up so you can see her without moving your head as much, etc. Nursing while lying down might help, too.I also urge you to nurse right before the surgery and as soon afterwards as you feel you can. Ask your doctor how you can expect to be feeling after surgery. I recall feeling really rotten the first day, but I think I could have nursed just fine as long as someone brought the baby to me. Your milk supply could go down a bit if you miss any nursings, so try to pump if you miss any feedings.One thing I was worried about with thyroid surgery was the scar in my case, it was pretty difficult to see after about 6 months (my surgeon said to give it a year), and now (4 years later) I cannot find the scar at all.Thyroid ScanThis scan can be done using radioactive iodine (I-131 or I-123) or technetium-99m pertechnetate. This test requires temporary weaning for a minimum of 12 hours, depending upon the isotope used (see below). Many times, this test can be skipped and a fine needle aspiration biopsy done instead (which does not require an interruption of breastfeeding).Technetium-99m has a very short half-life (6.02 hours, compared to 8.1 days for I-131). The amount of time suggested for suspending breastfeeding varies depending on the dosage and form of the isotope (there are many forms of Tc-99m). For some tests, breastfeeding can be resumed immediately; for others it is recommended to suspend breastfeeding for amounts of time varying from 6 hours to 48 hours. See the NRC Table  for additional guidance.I-123 has a half-life of 13.2 hours, and is available in several forms. For one of the forms of the isotope, Hale suggests suspending breastfeeding for 12-24 hours, depending upon the dose, but a couple of other forms/dosages do not require suspension of breastfeeding.I-131 concentrates in breastmilk and high levels in breastmilk can suppress babys thyroid function (or even destroy the thyroid) and increase risk of thyroid cancer. Therefore it is important that breastfeeding be discontinued until breastmilk levels are safe (this depends upon the dose and ranges from 8 days to 106+ days). The half-life for I-131 is 8.1 days. Hale recommends that when I-131 is used, breastmilk samples should be tested with a gamma (radiation) counter before breastfeeding is resumed to ensure that radiation in the milk has returned to safe levels. Lactation Risk Category is L4 (possibly hazardous).Important note: If you do suspend breastfeeding due to use of radioactive isotopes, it is important to pump regularly during this time. See also Maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing. You do not need to dump this milk. It can be dated, frozen and used after 5+ half-lives of the radioisotope have passed (after 5 half-lives, 96.9% of the radiation is gone; after 10 half-lives, 99.9% of the radiation is gone). You may also get the milk checked for radiation by your nuclear medicine department.Reference: Hale, 2002, p. 365-367, 675-676, 689-690. See also Use of Radioisotopes during Lactation.Radioactive iodine (RAI) Uptake ScanThis scan is done using radioactive iodine (I-131), and is usually done at the same time as a thyroid scan. See the info above on thyroid scans using I-131.See also Use of Radioisotopes during Lactation.The type of thyroid scan I had was a radioactive iodine uptake & thyroid scan. I had to drink some radioactive iodine, then come back later in the day to have the scan (like a x-ray). I was not nursing at the time.For nursing moms, there are usually other diagnostic procedures that can be done instead of a scan, for example, blood tests, ultrasound, and/or fine needle biopsy. The second time I needed diagnostic procedures, my doctor skipped the scan and just did a fine needle biopsy.Radioactive iodine treatment (RAI)This treatment is done using radioactive iodine (I-131), but in much larger doses than used for a diagnostic scan. Its purpose is to partially or completely destroy the thyroid. It is recommended that the mother discontinue breastfeeding several days to weeks before this therapy, and pump and dump milk for several weeks after therapy to reduce exposure of the breast tissue to radiation.

It occurs when a tiny bit of skin overgrows a milk duct opening and milk backs up behind it. A milk blister usually shows up as a painful white, clear or yellow dot on the nipple or areola (see photo), and the pain tends to be focused at that spot and just behind it. If you compress the breast so that milk is forced down the ducts, the blister will typically bulge outward. Milk blisters can be persistent and very painful during feeding, and may remain for several days or weeks and then spontaneously heal when the skin peels away from the affected area.This is not the same as a blister on the nipple caused by friction. This type of blister, which may sometimes be a red or brown blood blister, can be caused by friction from babys improper latch or sucking or from the use of a badly fitting nipple shield or pump. In this type of blister, the problem is nipple damage due to friction, rather than a milk duct opening being blocked. Here is information on healing broken skin in the nipple area. Another potential cause of blister-like sores on the nipple or breast isherpes.A white spot on the nipple may also be caused by an obstruction within the milk duct (as opposed to skin covering the milk duct). The obstruction might be a tiny, dry clump of hardened milk or a string of fattier, semi-solidified milk. The first type of milk duct obstruction will often pop out from the pressure of nursing or manual expression, or can be gently scraped from the surface of the milk duct with a fingernail. The second type can often be manually expressed from the milk duct; reducing saturated fats can help to prevent recurrence of this type of obstruction. Both of these types of milk duct obstruction are associated with recurrent mastitis.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.[top]What causes a milk blister?Milk blisters are thought to be caused by milk within a milk duct that has been sealed over by the epidermis and has triggered an inflammatory response. The underlying cause of a milk blister may be oversupply, pressure on that area of the breast, or the other usual causes of plugged ducts. Latch, suck, and or tongue problems may contribute to blisters because of friction on the tip of the nipple.Thrush (yeast), can also cause milk blisters. Thrush occasionally appears as tiny white spots on the nipple, but can also appear as larger white spots that block one or more milk ducts. If you have more than one blister at the same time, suspect thrush as the cause. Yeast is often accompanied by a burning pain, and the pain tends to be worse after nursing or pumping (whereas a plugged duct generally feels better after the breast has been emptied).[top]TreatmentImage credit: flickr Kazuhiro Keiro CC BY 2.0Recommended treatment for a milk blister usually consists of four steps: apply moist heat prior to nursing, clear the skin from the milk duct, nurse or pump with a hospital-grade pump, than follow up with medication to aid healing. You may need to repeat this for several days (or longer) until the plugged duct opening stays clear. Following are more detailed suggestions.1. Apply moist heat to soften the blister prior to nursing. Several times per day, add a saline soak prior to applying the moist heat. An epsom-salt soak before breastfeeding helps to open the milk duct opening and also aids in healing. Use a solution of epsom salt  2 teaspoons to 1 cup water. The epsom salt is first dissolved in a small amount of very hot water, then further water is added to cool it down enough to soak in. Try to add this epsom-salt soak to your routine at least 4 times per day.Prior to nursing (and directly after the epsom-salt soak) place an extremely hot wet compress on the milk blister immediately before nursing or pumping. Be careful not to burn yourself. A cotton ball soaked with olive oil can be used to soften the skin instead of the wet compress.2. Clear the skin from the milk duct.This may not be necessary, as the combination of the heat and nursing/pumping should cause the skin to expand and the blister to open. However, it can be helpful to do one of the following at least once per day until skin no longer grows over the duct.Rub the blister area with a moist washcloth.If a plug is protruding from the nipple, you can gently pull on it with clean fingers.Loosen an edge of the blister by gently scraping with your fingernail.If the above methods do not work, a sterile needle may also be used to open the blister. To minimize the risk for infection, ask your health care provider to do this (do not do this on your own). There is a much greater risk of infection if you do it yourself. First, wash the area well with soap and water; pat dry. Use a sterile needle to lift the skin at the edge of the blister. If a sterile needle is not available, sterilize needle with an autoclave or commercial sterilizing solution, by holding in a match flame until red hot (cool before using), or by soaking 10-15 minutes in rubbing alcohol. Use a lifting action, at the edge of the bleb, rather than a piercing action. Dont push into the blister as it can push bacteria deeper into the nipple. If there is any loose blister-like skin, your health care provider may need to remove that also, using sterile tweezers and small sharp scissors to entirely remove the excess skin. Follow up with a soap and water wash (and be sure to use an antibiotic ointment after nursing). See Healing broken skin in the nipple area.3. Nurse or pump with a hospital-grade pump. Nurse first on the breast with the milk blister, directly after applying heat.Before you nurse, it can be helpful to use breast compression and attempt to hand express back behind and down toward the nipple to release any thickened milk that has backed up in the duct. Sometimes clumps or strings of hardened milk (often of a toothpaste consistency) can be expressed from this duct.4. Treat the milk blister after nursing to aid healing. See Healing broken skin the nipple area[top]Additional treatments for recurring milk blistersLecithin supplements can help to heal and prevent recurrent plugged ductsMassaging the breast, areola and nipple with a massage oil containing grapefruit seed extract (GSE) can help to heal recurrent milk blisters. To make the massage oil: mix a few drops of grapefruit seed extract or citrus seed extract into olive oil.Another treatment for persistent milk blisters: Once per day, spray breast and nipple area with a solution consisting of 5 drops of grapefruit seed extract, 1/4 cup vinegar, and 2 cups water.Vitamin E ointment  applied very sparingly and wiped off before feedings (too much vitamin E can be toxic to baby)  can also help.[top]Further suggestions for healingSome suggest that you continue with a daily saline soak and brisk rub with a washcloth for a couple of weeks after the bleb resolves, to prevent recurrence.Call your doctor if any of the following occurs: fever, inflammation (redness), swelling, oozing, pus, etc.Between feedings, you can use ice packs and/or pain relievers (such as ibuprofen or tylenol) to relieve discomfort. Wearing breast shells, which will relieve the pressure from clothing, can also help with the pain and possibly aid healing.Dont forget to treat the underlying cause (if you know it) of the milk blister  oversupply, yeast, pressure on an area of the breast, etc.Additional InformationMastitis and Plugged Ducts @ Recurrent Mastitis or Plugged Ducts @ Nipple Blebs/Blisters by Catherine Watson Genna, BS, IBCLC (this article has a photo)FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Meet Our Sponsor: Undercover Mama,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/undercover-mama/,"Our sponsor for the month is Undercover MamaMeet Undercover Mamas Elisa Opt HofIn 2007, days after the birth of my fourth child, I realized I was pretty fed up with the lack of options I had for breastfeeding clothes. I figured by the fourth time around I should have this down, but instead I was still awkwardly fumbling through layers of clothing with one hand and holding a crying baby in the other.Sure, there were plenty of nursing shirts on the market. I had tried some of them and still found them tedious to try and open and close a bra while holding the panel or slit in the shirt open and holding the baby at the same time. I really didnt feel like conventional nursing shirts made the job any easier.After months of wearing a limited maternity wardrobe through pregnancy, what I really wanted was to be able to breastfeed comfortably in my regular wardrobe. Ive mostly been a jeans and t-shirt kind of girl and like to keep my options comfortable, simple and affordable. However, I just couldnt find a way to make breastfeeding comfortable in my regular shirts. When Id lift up my shirt to breastfeed, I hated baring my midriff. It just wasnt a part of my body I felt great about exposing . I tried various undershirts but still found them as awkward as the nursing clothestoo many layers to navigate with one hand. I needed to quickly and easily get my baby to the breast. I realized I wanted the job to be as simple as if I was just wearing my nursing bra. Thats when I came up with the idea for Undercover Mama shirts. It truly was a light bulb moment. Yes!, I thought. What I wanted was an undershirt that connected to and opened with my bra. No extra flaps, or layers or slits to dig through or hold aside! Just undo the bra and the attached shirt opens along with it. I loved the idea that I could wear the supportive nursing bras I needed and essentially turn them into a nursing tank that I could layer under any article of clothing.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I was so excited by the idea that I immediately wanted to buy one. Surely, I thought, something like that must already exist on the market. I got online and started searching. I didnt find anything like what I was imagining. I decided to make one on my own and loved it so much that I needed more. I knew other moms out there would very likely love one as well. After a quite a bit of research, I decided to go for it. I was a cash-strapped stay-at-home mom with 4 young children. I knew it wouldnt be easy but I was determined to make it happen.I set the goal to launch the product on the market by the time my new baby turned one. I worked hard to make that happen just a day before my deadline. Its been an exciting journey and I couldnt have done it without my amazing business partner, Elena Leppard that joined me early in the journey.

Transgender parents and chest/breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/transgender-parents-chestbreastfeeding/,"byTrevor MacDonaldNote: I have drawn some of this material from tip sheets that I published previously on my blog and for La Leche League Canada.OverviewPhoto used with permission.Transgender men and women, and non-binary and genderqueer individuals, are physiologically capable of breast or chestfeeding, even if they have had previous chest surgery or have never given birth. It is equally important to note that some trans people experience severe gender dysphoria when breast or chestfeeding, and that they may decide not to nurse their babies for mental health reasons. Trans parents choosing to breast or chestfeed and those choosing to suppress lactation and bottlefeed may require the support of breastfeeding counselors or lactation professionals.This article covers:key terms and concepts that are important for understanding transgender identity and healthtransgender women and breastfeedinghormone replacement therapyinducing lactationfinding health care professionalsbreastfeeding goalssupport meetingstransgender men and chestfeedinglanguagegender dysphoriatestosterone usetop surgerybindingchestfeeding goalssupporting the decision not to nursesupport meetingsadditional resourcesNow infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Key terms and conceptsGender vs. SexOur reproductive organs and sexual anatomy define our physical sex  male, female, or intersex. Gender, however, is a persons inner awareness of their femininity/masculinity.In most cases, a persons biological sex conforms to their gender and gender expression. The term for such people is cisgender. Transgender, transsexual, and genderfluid people have a gender identity or gender expression that does not match what their particular society expects of them according to their anatomy. Some trans people choose to use medical therapies such as hormone treatments and/or surgeries to alter their bodies. Others do not want or are unable to obtain such interventions, but may express their gender in other ways such as choices of clothing or makeup.Gender Identity vs Sexual OrientationA persons gender identity has to do with how they self-identify in terms of their inner sense of gender. Their sexual orientation refers to what kind of person they are sexually attracted to. A person can be trans and gay, or trans and straight, or trans and bisexual, etc.chestfeeding: Some masculine-identified trans people use this term to describe the act of feeding their baby from their chest, regardless of whether they have had chest surgery. Note that others prefer to say breastfeeding or nursing. The choice is individual, and health care providers should ask clients what they prefer.FtM: female-to-male trans personMtF: male-to-female trans persongender binary: The assumption that there are two genders, male and female. Many trans people understand gender as a spectrum.gender expression: a persons outward presentation of their gender through physical traits, clothing, makeup, etc.genderfluid/genderqueer: someone who identifies between or beyond the extremes of female and male on the gender spectrum, or who identifies as both female and male at once or as some combination of genders.intersex: a condition in which an individual is born with reproductive and/or sexual anatomy that does not fit the usual male or female definitions.trans: an umbrella term meant to include transgender, transsexual and genderfluid peopletransgender: a person whose gender identity or expression does not match the typical societal expectations of their birth-assigned gender. Transgender people may or may not wish to modify their bodies to varying degrees by taking hormones or having surgery.transition: a change in ones public gender identity (ones inner gender identity may have been the same since birth).transsexual: a person whose gender identity does not match their sex as it was assigned at birth. Transsexual people usually wish to modify their bodies in order to alleviate this incongruence. This older term is narrower in its definition than the newer umbrella term, transgender (see above), but is still preferred by some trans individuals.LanguageAlways use the pronouns that refer to an individuals expressed gender, not their assigned birth sex. For example, a male-to-female transsexual woman is she. If you are unsure of which pronouns a particular individual may use, simply ask in a respectful manner. If you make a mistake, apologize promptly and move on. Some people use gender-neutral pronouns, such as them and they or ze and zir.The following terms are derogatory. Do not use: tranny, he-she, she-male, gender-bender.Do not refer to someone masquerading, pretending, disguising, etc. in their gender.Use transgender as an adjective, not a noun or verb.He is a transgender person, not He is a transgender.A person is transgender, not transgendered. It is never necessary to add the suffix ed to transgender.Avoid the phrases biologically female (or male), genetically female, and born a woman. Biological sex is complex and it is dependent on multiple factors including chromosomes, hormones, secondary sex characteristics, and internal and external reproductive organs. Biological sex is not purely binary, as various international sports organizations have been finding out when they pursue sex testing of athletes. It is more accurate and respectful to mention someones sex as it was assigned at birth rather than their biological sex or genetic sex. The phrasing assigned at birth reminds us that parents and health care providers commonly presume a babys sex and gender based on the babys visible reproductive organs.Information for trans women and their helpersTrans women are individuals who were designated as male at birth based on their anatomy but identify on the feminine side of the gender spectrum. Some trans women may wish to breastfeed their children via induced lactation and/or using a supplementer.Hormone replacement therapyTrans women commonly take anti-androgen medication if they have not had orchiectomy (bilateral testicle removal). Following orchiectomy, anti-androgen therapy may be ceased and estrogen dosage decreased.Some physicians prescribe estrogen but not progestin for trans women under the assumption that adding progestin does not increase breast size over estrogen alone. However, progesterone plays an important role in lobuloalveolar development. For this reason, a trans woman may wish to take progestin in addition to estrogen if she intends to breastfeed in the future.Inducing LactationTrans women may induce lactation by following the Newman-Goldfarb protocol. A physician may prescribe the appropriate medications. Birth control pills should be started about six months before the baby is expected or as soon as possible. Domperidone is also suggested in the protocol. 6-8 weeks before the birth, the birth control pills should be stopped, and the woman should begin pumping frequently to stimulate glandular tissue and to remove milk. The domperidone is normally continued for the duration of the lactation period.A trans woman should discuss with a physician, such as a reproductive endocrinologist, what kind of hormone treatment is best to take during lactation. Unfortunately, there has been little to no research done in this area. One trans woman reported that she successfully took a decreased dose of her usual estrogen while lactating. Medications, such as anti-androgens or estrogens, should be carefully considered for safety during lactation on an individual basis, like with any medication or supplement.Finding health care professionalsTo date, there has been much more extensive media coverage and interest from health care providers and researchers regarding the needs of trans men around lactation than for trans women. Trans women also typically face higher levels of discrimination and violence in society in general. Anecdotally speaking, I have received several reports of trans women unable to find local breastfeeding counselors or lactation consultants willing to assist them. Consultations online or by phone may be necessary for this reason. Trans women are welcome to join the Facebook group Birthing and Breast or Chestfeeding Trans People and Alliesfor support and to locate lactation helpers.Breastfeeding goalsSome trans women have induced lactation with impressive results, providing nearly a full supply to their babies. The amount of milk that is produced will depend somewhat on how many years the woman used hormones prior to inducing lactation, and how fully her glandular tissue developed during that time. If the woman had implant surgery, she may encounter some difficulty with severed ducts, damaged nerves, compressed glandular tissue, and/or scarring.As is the case with chestfeeding trans men, the amount of milk that is produced is not the only consideration since the nursing relationship may be equally or even more important to the nursing couple. An at-breast supplementer may be used to support a nursing relationship.Group meetingsHealth care providers and breastfeeding counselors should encourage trans breastfeeding parents to attend group meetings. Those leading meetings should ensure that a safe and positive environment is provided. We know that peer support is an important predictor of a parents success achieving their personal breastfeeding goals. Trans parents may already feel isolated, especially if they do not know other LGBT families. Group meetings can be tremendously beneficial.Information for transmasculine individuals and their helpersTransmasculine individuals are people who were designated as female at birth according to their anatomy but identify on the masculine side of the gender spectrum. Some choose to give birth and/or nurse their babies, and may require lactation support.LanguageAlthough both men and women have breast tissue, the word breast is most often associated with women. Trans men may be more comfortable referring to their chest and chestfeeding or nursing their infants (regardless of whether they have had chest surgery), rather than breastfeeding. Trans men may refer to themselves as dad, papa, or another term, rather than mom. As a helper, dont make assumptions. Remember that if you are unsure, it is best to ask about which names and pronouns an individual uses. If you make a mistake, apologize promptly and move on.Health care providers and volunteers should update language on web sites, intake forms and information sheets to be inclusive of trans men and genderfluid individuals. This could involve using the word parent instead of or in addition to mother or using you language. Eg. Instead of our practice aims to support new mothers in their personal feeding goals, one could state, We aim to support you in your personal feeding goals.Gender DysphoriaGender dysphoria occurs when an individual feels discomfort due to parts of their body that do not match their gender identity. Growth (or re-growth after top surgery) of chest tissue during pregnancy may bring up extreme feelings of gender dysphoria in some individuals, possibly causing anxiety or even depression. Chestfeeding can do the same. For this reason, deciding to chestfeed is a very personal choice.Feelings of gender dysphoria may be triggered or exacerbated when a trans individual is misgendered by others, including health care providers and lactation helpers.Testosterone UseMany, but not all, trans men choose to take testosterone. Testosterone normally causes the cessation of menstruation and ovulation, and brings about male secondary sex characteristics.When a trans man stops taking testosterone, his cycles are likely to return after several weeks or months, depending on how long he took the medication and his own physical particularities. Throughout the medical literature, it has been assumed that testosterone use permanently affects secondary sex characteristics. However, my study group reported in 2016 in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirththat this is not always the case. Some trans men may retain their facial hair and deeper voice when they stop taking testosterone, but others may not. Loss of facial hair and other typical male secondary sex characteristics may result in increased feelings of gender dysphoria and may affect the way that others perceive the individuals gender identity.Although rare, some trans men have been known to become pregnant accidentally while taking testosterone. Testosterone is highly toxic to the fetus and should never be used during pregnancy. However, because the body metabolizes and clears testosterone rapidly, it is considered safe to conceive within a few months of discontinuing most forms of testosterone therapy.In our research article, my study group reported the first documented instance of a trans individual taking testosterone during the lactation period. The study participant explained that he made an informed choice under the guidance of his physician, and that his childs pediatrician monitored the child through blood tests. The participant reported that the blood tests showed no evidence of testosterone exposure in the child. The participant did not feel that his milk supply was adversely affected by taking testosterone.Top SurgerySome trans men choose to have male chest-contouring surgery, also known as top surgery. This is different from a mastectomy (a cancer treatment), or a breast reduction, which is performed to make a smaller but still female chest. The goal of top surgery is to create a male-appearing chest. In order to do this some, but not all, of the clients mammary tissue is removed. Complete removal of the mammary tissue would result in a sunken chest shape.The preferred surgical technique for top surgery is variable, depending on factors such as volume of tissue and skin elasticity of the client. The double incision technique usually involves nipple grafts, and is not ideal for maintaining nipple sensation or preserving milk ducts. However, some surgeons performing the double incision surgery use a pedicle technique to keep the nipple attached to a thin stalk of tissue throughout the procedure. The peri-areolar approach, with incisions that go around the outer borders of the areolae, leaves the nipple stalks intact and likely has better results than nipple grafting does in terms of future breastfeeding and milk production.Trans men who are planning top surgery after weaning should note that many surgeons require clients to wait six months after the end of lactation before having chest or breast surgery.BindingA trans man who has not had top surgery may choose to bind his chest in order to flatten it, thereby managing his gender dysphoria. Many years of binding may adversely affect the glandular tissue. Binding during the immediate postpartum period will increase the risk of blocked ducts and mastitis and may damage the milk supply. However, some individuals have had success with occasional, careful binding once the milk supply is well established and regulated. Anyone who practices binding during the lactation period should be advised of the risks of doing so, and should monitor the health of their chest closely.Chestfeeding GoalsSome trans men who give birth do not want to chestfeed at all, in some cases for reasons to do with mental health and gender dysphoria. Others do, and sometimes opt to postpone desired top surgery so that they will be able to produce a full milk supply.Health care providers should be respectful when providing hands-on care. As in most health care situations, ask permission before touching an individuals body, explaining what you are planning to do and why. If an individual is not comfortable being touched, find other ways to help, such as demonstrating on yourself. Watch for signs of postpartum depression. Trans individuals may be at risk due to experiences of gender dysphoria in addition to the usual challenges of giving birth and caring for a newborn.Photo used with permission.When assisting those who wish to chestfeed after a previous top surgery, it is essential to remember that nursing a baby is not only about the milk. An individual who has had surgery may produce a surprising amount of milk, or only drops, or nothing at all. Any amount of milk is valuable. By using an at-chest (at-breast) supplementer, the parent and baby can gain the benefit of bonding through a nursing relationship even in the absence of milk production. In addition, the action of nursing helps promote the normal development of the jaws and teeth in the infant.Latching may be challenging for a parent who has had previous top surgery due to a relative lack of pliable tissue and skin. The parent may need to learn how to vigorously mould the chest tissue (make a sandwich). When providing assistance, be creative and expect to try many different grasps from varying angles in order to find what works. A reclining position may unfortunately cause the chest tissue to become even more taut and difficult to latch to. In this case, football hold or cross cradle may be easier.A nipple shield might also be considered although it may be impractical to juggle both a nipple shield and a supplementer.Supporting the Decision NOT to NurseLactation helpers can support an individual who has chosen not to chestfeed by sharing how to quickly and safely reduce the milk supply after the birth. Explain the supply and demand system that governs lactation. Encourage the client to remove only as much milk as necessary to feel relatively comfortable, since removing more milk will cause the body to increase production. Cold compresses and cold cabbage leaves may help reduce pain and swelling. The parent should not bind at this time due to the increased risk of pain, blocked ducts, and mastitis. Several herbs such as sage, peppermint, and parsley are said to decrease milk supply.Trans men who have had top surgery, regardless of surgical technique, should not assume that their body will not make milk following birth. If they plan not to chestfeed, they and their health care providers should watch for signs of engorgement and mastitis.Discuss the many other ways of bonding with baby, such as bed-sharing, babywearing, and loving, attentive feeding. You may wish to let the client know about the possibility of obtaining human milk through milk sharing sites such as Human Milk 4 Human Babies or Eats on Feets.Support MeetingsHealth care providers and breastfeeding counselors should encourage trans breast or chestfeeding parents to attend group meetings. Those leading meetings should ensure that a safe and positive environment is provided. We know that peer support is an important predictor of a parents success achieving their personal breastfeeding goals. Trans parents may already feel isolated, especially if they do not know other LGBT families. Group meetings can be tremendously beneficial.Those facilitating the meeting should know the location of a mens washroom or gender-neutral washroom near the meeting room. They should use gender-neutral language such as breastfeeding parent instead of mother when addressing the group.Resources and Further InformationLanguage:For more detailed information about using respectful, accurate language, see the GLAAD media guide: www.glaad.org/reference/transgenderTrans women and breastfeeding:Facebook-based Birthing and Breast or Chestfeeding Trans People and Allies: www.facebook.com/groups/TransReproductiveSupportMacDonald, T.

Newborn Sleep: A discussion with Elizabeth Pantley,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/newborn-sleep-a-discussion-with-elizabeth-pantley/,"What is the number one issue among parents of babies? Sleep!We wantedto talk to someone who has spent many yearshelpingparents withinfant sleep issues, so we interviewedElizabeth Pantley, who has written the No-Cry Sleep Solution series of books. Her new book, The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Newborns, was released in October 2016.1) How did you get started in sleep research?My fourth baby propelled me into sleep research because as a year old he was still waking up to breastfeed every few hours all night long, every night. People told me I had two choices: to live with it, or to let my baby cry-it-out. I certainly wanted  and needed  my sleep, but I was adamantly against letting my baby cry to sleep. I thought it was a cruel and heartless way to treat the tiny, innocent, trusting little love of your life.But, as a busy author and mom of three other children I was a walking zombie! I desperately needed to find a way to help us both sleep better  ways that were respectful to my baby and that did not include crying. I launched myself into research and gathered a group of test parents with non-sleeping babies to be my test cases  and The No-Cry Sleep Solution was born. That book is now ten years old and available worldwide in 27 languages  clearly sleep is a critical topic for all families.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Twenty months ago my oldest child had my first grandbaby  and I learned the joys of being Nana. This new life reminded me how hard it is to care for a newborn, and I realized that I had a wealth of sleep knowledge to share which would make these early months much more relaxed and peaceful for babies and their parents, and so The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Newborns was born soon after my first grandchild!In the book you mention you have worked with thousands of new parents. Could you tell us a little more about your research for this book?Sleep, or more accurately, lack of sleep is the number one issue among parents of babies. As an author of four books specifically on the topic of sleep you can bet my inbox is daily filled with letters from sleepless parents needing help! When I begin work on a new topic I gather a group of families to get their input, ideas, and questions. I have found that the best way to use all the valuable research that exists is to put it to use in the real world, with real families. The combination of research and real life is what makes ideas and solutions usable for families.2) Some parents say their baby wakes constantly; others say they sleep for hours at a time. What are the ranges for normal night time sleep patterns in newborns?Its something we adults seem to overlook  just as we all sleep differently from each other, so do our babies. There are many factors that affect how a baby sleeps, and there is a wide range of normal. Even still, there are similarities that we should consider. Newborn babies will sleep 15 to 18 hours out of every 24, and about 6 to 8 of those hours will occur as daytime naps  if we understand and respect their sleep needs. If we dont understand their needs they wont sleep well  and this is a very common problem. If we dont help them get the sleep they crave they can become agitated, and fussy  and this further prevents them getting the sleep they need. Thats why its important to learn whats normal for a newborn and help your infant get the sleep he needs.One of the most important keys to good newborn sleep has nothing to do with sleep hours and more to do with awake times. Newborns can only stay happily awake for forty-five minutes to an hour or two at a time. If they are routinely sleeping well at night and getting good, long naps, then by six months most babies can stay awake for two to three hours. However, all newborns do best with short awake spans interspersed with plenty of naps. If your baby has been awake beyond this happily awake span you have likely missed some sleepy signals, and your newborn is overtired. An overtired baby will be fussy and find it hard to sleep, yet wont be able to stay happily awake, either.3) Lets go to the question that many new parents want to know: When will their child begin to sleep through the night?This is the most common question about babies and sleep! The problem here is the perpetuation of the myth that babies should sleep independently through the night from the time they are a few months old. Sure, a handful of babies do sleep through the night from the start (One of my four was one of those unicorn babies!) but most do not. Sleep patterns, and the ability to sleep all night, have a powerful biological foundation. We can affect this somewhat with routines and our actions, but just like your childs eye color, height and the amount of hair on her head, much of your childs sleep patterns are out of your control.Babies have immature sleep systems. They have very tiny tummies  only about the size of a cherry at birth! Babies grow rapidly, their liquid diet digests quickly. During those early months, your baby will have tremendous growth spurts that affect not only daytime feedings, but nighttime feeding needs as well.This means that it is perfectly natural, absolutely normal, and totally expected for your baby to wake up in the night and need nourishment or your help to fall back to sleep. Sleeping all through the night, every night, without needing a parents assistance, is like learning to walk or talk or drink from a cup  all kids get there, but they do so at their own speed, a little bit at a time, and in their own unique way.4) You discuss the need to learn your babys sleep cues. Why is that important?Your baby will give you signs when she is tired. Reading these sleepy signals correctly is critically important, and will affect the results of every other sleep solution you use. If you miss the window of tiredness, your baby will quickly become overtired. An overtired baby is cranky, cries more, and ironically, wont fall asleep easily or for very long. On the flip side, a baby who is not yet tired will reject any efforts to sleep, and will fuss over your insistence! Dancing between just tired enough and too tired is a fine line, but if you know what to look for, you can find the perfect moment with your baby.5) Are there any signs of sleepiness in a newborn that new parents often miss or misinterpret?A very common mistake is to misread a babys signals and respond in just about the opposite way that your baby means for you to. A typical sign of tiredness is looking away and losing interest in people or toys. Many people interpret these tired actions to mean Im bored, or I need you to sing louder, or shake the rattle more, or bounce me more, or try harder to get me to smile,  when what the baby is desperately trying to say is, I am tired and I need to sleep  please help me to fall asleep! If you learn to speak your babys language you will enjoy the prize of clear communication and easier sleep.6) What are some key things new mothers can do to get more rest?I would say the most important idea is to learn whats normal and stop hoping for something else. The early months with your baby are about getting to know this new little person and finding your place as a parent. Whether this is your first baby or your sixth baby you should honor these early months with the time and peace that they deserve. Dont let the outside world prevent you from taking the time you need to learn all you can about your brand-new baby. In the early weeks, avoid having too much company, too many outings and too many distractions, as these can get in the way of focusing on your baby. Relax your housekeeping standards. Whittle down your to-do list. Remind yourself every day that your number one priority is getting to know your baby. If you remove outside pressures and cue into your baby then both your infant and you will get more rest.7) What is breastsleeping and how does that impact the sleep of mother and baby? Is this something you recommend?Breastsleeping is a new term coined by sleep authority Dr. James McKenna of the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Lab at the University of Notre Dame. It identifies the natural and powerful relationship between breastfeeding and sleep, and the connection between a breastfeeding mother and baby. His research has shown a very particular sleep architecture that appears in the breastfeeding mother/baby pair which keeps the baby safe in a bed-sharing environment and allows the baby to feed frequently throughout the night, which is natural for a newborn.I was a breastsleeping mother with all four of my children long before the term existed, just like countless other mothers, since this pattern has occurred naturally all over the world since the beginning of time. Im in favor of safe bed-sharing and breastsleeping is one of the keys to creating a safe sleeping condition for an infant, and also which provides a breastfeeding mother with the maximum amount of peaceful sleep.8) You discuss using pink-hued white noise as a sleep aid. How is that different from plain white noise?The environment that your baby enjoyed in the womb was filled with a constant symphony of sound therefore many newborns find a totally quiet room disconcerting. Because of this prenatal history, white noise sounds can be soothing to many babies and help them to relax, fall asleep and stay asleep. White noise is an indistinct background hum, such as the rumble of a motor, the drone of a fan or the swish of ocean waves.White noise is also helpful because it blocks out sharp noises (clinking dishes, dogs barking, television sounds, sibling squeals) that can wake your sleeping baby. It also creates a consistent sleep cue that tells your baby it is time to sleep.Not all white noise is created equal! Pink noise is a variant of white noise that sounds full, deep, rich and monotonous. Perfect examples of pink noise are the sounds of a heartbeat, a fan or humidifier, ocean waves, the patter of rainfall or the rustling of leaves on a tree.In contrast, examples of pure white noise include things like a vacuum cleaner, the static between stations on a radio, and the squeal of a hair dryer, which all are made up of a higher pitch and intensity. As you can see, there are subtle but important differences that make pink noise gentler on the ear, and a better match for aiding sleep.9) Whats the most important sleep tip for parents of a newborn to know?Your baby will tell you what he needs  but you need to watch, listen and learn. Your baby is born with a unique personality, and you will soon become the best interpreter for your own baby. But it takes time to figure your baby out! You may feel more love than youve ever felt before in your life, but that doesnt mean youll know how to interpret your babys body language and noises right off the bat, and you wont always read your babys tired signs accurately. The good news is that you will learn quickly and in no time you will become the best expert on your very own baby.About Elizabeth Pantley: Elizabeth is the author of twelve popular parenting books, available in twenty-seven languages, including the best-selling No-Cry Solution series.She is known by millions worldwide as a teacher of respectful and effective parenting methods.

A message from our sponsor: October is Pregnancy and Baby Loss Awareness Month,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/october-pregnancy-baby-loss-awareness-month/,"Our sponsor for the month is Earth Mama Angel BabyAt Earth Mama Angel Baby we get to see the joyful side of pregnancy, but we also deal with all of the real issues, from the physical discomfort of morning sickness, anxiety, and hemorrhoids to the heartbreaking pain of baby loss. Earth Mama Angel Babys sister site, Healing Hearts Baby Loss Comfort, was created in response to the reality that some pregnancies do not end happily. We wanted to offer a place for women to feel comfortable looking for real, physical comfort, herbal remedies and spiritual nurturing, as well as a space to find resources, honor their grief and express their loss.We also wanted to create a place for those looking to support someone who has lost a baby. It can be so difficult to know what to do or say when a baby dies. So many people are touched by miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death (death in the first 28 days of life), but we struggle to have solid, reliable ways of dealing with grief. The Healing Hearts Baby Loss Comfortwebsite has suggestions about what to do and say, and ideas to comfort and support grief and healing. Grieving parents may choose to leave a personal message, poem or tribute to their baby on the Remembering Baby page. The Grief Resources page includes links to supportive sites and articles. What Do I Say? is a good place to start if you are a concerned person who is feeling at a loss.In addition and as a supplement to the web site, we also created a supportive Facebook community for people suffering from loss. Overseen by Peggy OMara, journalistic thought leader and founding Mothering Magazine editor, theHealing Hearts Baby Loss ComfortFacebook community is an active place for women to seek and offer support.Women who have suffered the loss of a baby are postpartum mothers too. Miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death leave women requiring not just emotional but also physical support. The Healing Hearts line was created to help comfort the specific physical postpartum needs of baby loss, as well as the aching hearts of grieving mamas. For physical and spiritual relief, Earth Mamas Healing Hearts Comfort Gifts include a tea to ease engorged breasts, a spirit-soothing spray, a meditation candle, and seeds to sow and nurture.Its hard to know what to say to a grieving parent. Our own fear of loss can render us immobile. And sometimes people feel like they have to think of the perfect thing to say. There is no perfect thing to say. There is nothing you can say to heal the grief of losing a child. But acknowledging and supporting grief is a way to help healing. Please know that the effort of talking about the baby, the loss, and the sadness will be appreciated, even if its not perfect. Simply allowing a safe space for them to grieve without denying that grief is all thats required of you. Remember, it is usually the simple things you say or do that mean so much.Click here tovisit Earth Mama Angel Baby and use code MamaKelly20for 20% off any regularly priced individual product through October 2016.About Earth Mama Angel BabyEarth Mama Angel Baby combines generations of womens wisdom and traditional plant medicine with the safety and assurances of contemporary evidence-based research to offer safe trusted natural herbal products that work.

"Babies, Breasts and Body Mods: What You Need to Know",http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/body-mods/,"byRobyn Roche-Paull,BSN, RN, IBCLC, USN Veteran, of Breastfeeding in CombatBoots You cant breastfeed if you have tattoos on your breasts, the ink will get into your breastmilk.Youll never be able to breastfeed since your nipples have been pierced.Your baby will get HIV or Hepatitis from your body mods if you breastfeed.These are just some of the things said to women who have body mods and want to breastfeed. Oftentimes they hear these myths from health care practitioners, other times it is from well-meaning friends or uninformed breastfeeding support counselors. Contrary to popular belief, body mods and breastfeeding are compatible, so long as certain precautions are followed.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.A Brief History of Body ModsBody Modifications are a group of practices that include branding, scarification, tattooing, piercing, and other types of body art. Archaeologists, historians and body art practitioners note that tattooing and body piercing have been performed, in one form or another, worldwide for over 5000 years. Recently however, body modifications have experienced an explosion in popularity, with people both young and old getting body mods of various types. More than 20 million Americans, more than half of whom are women, have one or more tattoos and up to 30% have piercings, and nearly 10% have both (DeBoer, Seaver, Angel, & Armstrong, 2008). This surge in body modifications shows no signs of slowing down in the near future.Many women today get tattoos and piercings as a form of self-expression or to commemorate a special occasion or life event (Caliendo, Armstrong, & Roberts, 2005). For whatever reason, women today are getting body modifications in greater numbers at the same time that many are also becoming mothers. Along with the rise in body modifications, breastfeeding has seen resurgence in popularity as well. With breastfeeding rates climbing it is not surprising that many new mothers, who either already have body modifications or who may be contemplating them in the future, might have questions as to the safety of breastfeeding. Is breastfeeding safe with current tattoos and nipple piercings? Can you get a new tattoo or piercing while breastfeeding? This article will help you answer those questions and dispel a few myths along the way.Nipple piercingsNipple piercings are a favorite among body mod fans, but they require patience when healing and are not without risk. Nipple piercings can take up to a full year to heal completely, with infections and rejections due to improper aftercare the most common problems. If you are contemplating getting your nipples pierced and also want to have a baby, it is best to plan to get your piercings at least 12-18 months before you plan to get pregnant (Angel, 2009). This allows the piercing time to heal and create a fistula, or channel, before the bodily and hormonal changes that accompany pregnancy occur. It also will allow for removal of the jewelry during breastfeeding without the worry of the channel closing up. The nipple(s) must have time to heal and cannot have any saliva enter the open wound; the jewelry must also remain in place during the healing period, something that is next to impossible to achieve with a young baby to feed frequently. If you have just recently had a baby, be aware that professional piercers will not pierce a woman who is currently breastfeeding and will actively discourage a new mother from doing so. In that case you will have to decide if you can wait until your baby weans. Another option to consider is drying up one breast and piercing your nipples one at a time.Many women who already have nipple piercings are concerned about their ability to breastfeed. Breastfeeding is not generally affected by established nipple piercings. Human nipples have between 8-12 nipple pores therefore it is unlikely that a well-healed piercing will block all of the pores. However, there have been a few reported cases of abnormal milk production in women with nipple piercings due to possible duct obstruction (Garbin, Deacon, Rowan, Hartmann, & Geddes, 2009). More often women find that when they do remove their jewelry for a feeding that milk leaks out the piercing, this can be problematic if the flow is too fast for your infant. In either case, be proactive about preventing or reducing any engorgement and be on the lookout for blocked ducts or mastitis, all of which may be exacerbated by nipple piercings (Armstrong, Caliendo, & Roberts, 2006).It is best to remove your jewelry for each feeding, to reduce the risk of your baby aspirating or choking, although some women do nurse with flexible PTFE barbells in place (Angel, 2009). Removing your jewelry also reduces the risk of latching-on problems, such as damage to the inside of your babys mouth or the passing of bacteria from the jewelry to your baby. If you chose to keep your jewelry out permanently until your baby is weaned, be aware that even a fully healed piercing may close and some women have noticed nipple pain in a previously pierced nipple while nursing (Wilson-Clay & Hoover, 2005). You can keep the piercing open by inserting an insertion taper on a regular basis. If the channel closes completely wait at least three months post-weaning before re-piercing (Armstrong, Caliendo, & Roberts, 2006). If you face any problems with breastfeeding be sure to contact your local LLL Leader or an IBCLC for help. For problems with your piercing you should be seen by a qualified piercer.TattoosTattoos are a permanent form of artwork etched into the flesh and are also not without risk. As with piercings, local and systemic infections due to improper aftercare are the most prevalent risks of tattooing, an allergic response to the inks used in the tattoo is another possibility. Already present tattoos, on the breast or elsewhere, do not impact breastfeeding. Tattoo inks are made of synthetic or natural pigments (some are made with heavy metals) and the FDA does NOT regulate them as they are not meant to be injected under the skin (FDA, 2008). Tattoos are permanent because the ink remains walled off within the body via the bodys inflammatory process, making the possibility of the ink migrating into the mothers blood plasma and then into the milk-making cells of the breast, next to impossible.Like piercers, professional tattoo artists will not knowingly tattoo a woman who is currently breastfeeding and will actively discourage a new mother from doing so. Tattoo artists feel that the body needs time to heal the tattoo and that it is harder to do so when the body is producing milk. Not tattooing a breastfeeding mother also lessens the possibility of any infections, from either improper tattooing or aftercare, from being passed on to the baby (Hudson, 2009). If you choose to get a tattoo while breastfeeding keep in mind that a newborn baby is far more vulnerable to any possible changes in breastmilk than a nursing toddler. It is best to wait until your baby is at least 9-12 months old. Going to a professional tattoo shop following Universal Precautions also lessens the risk of any infections that might be acquired.Tattoo RemovalIt is estimated that 20% of those who get tattoos later regret the decision and wish to have them removed (Armstrong, et al., 2008). Tattoo removal is now accomplished with the use of Q-switched lasers. The laser works by producing short pulses of intense light that passes through the skin to be absorbed by the tattoo pigment. The laser energy causes the tattoo pigment to fragment into smaller particles, which are picked up by the bodys immune system and filtered out. The particles are considered too big to pass into breastmilk. The removal process is bloodless, low risk and has minimal side effects (Reardon, 2008). The same aftercare as for a tattoo applies to its removal. Tylenol is often prescribed for the pain, if needed. Possible side effects include pigmentation changes, local infection (due to not following the aftercare regimen) and possible allergic reaction to the ink that is now free in the mothers system. Mothers usually have no problems if they follow the recommended aftercare procedures.Universal PrecautionsWhether you are contemplating a tattoo or getting your nipples pierced it is very important that your tattoo artist or piercer follow Universal Precautions. Professional tattooists and piercers will follow all universal precautions such as sterilization of the tattoo machine and piercing implements using an autoclave, single-use inks, ink cups, gloves and needles, bagging of equipment to avoid cross contamination, thorough hand washing with disinfectant soap and the wearing of gloves when performing the tattoo or piercing (Armstrong, et al., 2006). Any jewelry that is to be inserted should be kept sterile before insertion as well. There have been no known cases of HIV passed on through tattoos or piercings via regulated artists that follow Universal Precautions. It is important to screen your piercer/tattooist and the shop carefully, checking with the local health department for local laws and regulations. Reputable body artists support regulations and legislation to keep their customers safe and to legitimize the profession. The Association of Professional Piercers and the Association of Professional Tattooists both have a wealth of information on safe body modifications and what to look for in a practitioner. Finally, keep in mind that human milk cannot be donated to a milk bank if the mother has received a piercing or tattoo within the previous 12 months due to possible infectious disease transmission (HMBANA, 2003).If you are a mother who has or desires body modifications, you should feel safe knowing that you can still successfully breastfeed if you follow the precautions outlined above. Go ahead and make a statement with your piercings and tattoos, just follow the rules and make sure your piercer or tattoo artist does too. Body art and breastfeeding are not mutually exclusive. You can certainly provide your baby with his mothers milk from a very beautifully decorated and adorned body.Handout (for personal use only):What Every Breastfeeding Mother Needs to Know About Body ModificationsReferencesAngel, E.

Hunger Cues – When do I feed baby?,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/hunger-cues/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCBabies should be fed when they indicate hunger. Crying is a late indicator of hunger  breastfeeding is much easier for both mom and baby if mom is able to pick up on babys earlier hunger cues.Common infant hunger cues include:Early hunger cueEarlySmacking or licking lipsOpening and closing mouthSucking on lips, tongue, hands, fingers, toes, toys, or clothingActiveRooting around on the chest of whoever is carrying himTrying to position for nursing, either by lying back or pulling on your clothesFidgeting or squirming around a lotHitting you on the arm or chest repeatedlyFussing or breathing fastLate hunger cueLate (calm baby before feeding)Moving head frantically from side to sideCryingMy newborn wants to sleep all the time! Should I wake him to nurse?Yes, if he doesnt wake on his own. Many newborns are very sleepy in the early days or weeks and may not exhibit hunger cues as often as they actually need to eat. Newborns should be nursed anytime they cue hunger, but at least every 2 hours during the day and at least once during the night. Once your baby has established a good weight gain pattern (at least 4 ounces per week, for babies under 4 months), you can stop waking baby to nurse and let him set his own pattern.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.My baby just started sleeping longer at night. Do I need to wake him to nurse?If your baby is younger than 4 weeks, then it is a good idea to wake baby at least every 4-5 hours at night to nurse if he does not wake on his own. If your child is older than 4 weeks, you can allow baby to sleep as long as he wants at night as long as he is peeing, pooping, and gaining weight within normal parameters.My baby frequently sucks on his hands. Does this always mean that hes hungry?After the newborn period, hand sucking is not as reliable an indicator of hunger. Starting at around 6-8 weeks, baby will begin to gain more control over his hands and will soon begin to explore his hands and everything else using his mouth. It is also common for babies to suck on their hands when their gums become tender in preparation for tooth eruption. Symptoms of teething can sometimes occur weeks and even months before the first tooth erupts.

When Breastfeeding is Hard,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/whenbreastfeedingishard/,"by Carol Smyth, BSc, MSc, IBCLCImage licensed under Creative Commonsfrom PinkOnHead.comToday Im writing for those of you who are struggling with breastfeeding. Those who feel that maybe breastfeeding isnt for you, or that you arent able to, or are feeling like you are spending most of the day crying about how breastfeeding is going.We hear a lot about how wonderful breastfeeding is. I write about it many times; how it is wonderfully bonding; the feeling of confidence as you see your baby grow; the incredible simplicity of a baby falling asleep and resting against your breast. There is nothing like these experiences. Every woman deserves to feel this with their baby, but what if that is not happening for you  or not in the way you think it should? What if your confidence is not actually growing as your baby does?Many times when I see mums, it is when they are almost at breaking point. They are not sure whether they can continue. The very fact that they call me tells me that they desperately want to continue, but they just cant see a way out of whatever is going on for them. Often they are being told that a bottle will resolve all the problems. It will be easier. It will be better for their mental health. Is that really true?Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Breastfeeding is natural. Why cant I do it?What does that phrase breastfeeding is natural mean? Does it mean that on the day you give birth you suddenly know how to breastfeed and that knowledge will equip you for growth spurts and fussy evenings and latching issues and teething and all the things that come along the way? If that is what the phrase suggests to you as a mother, then I think we should stop using that phrase.Parenting is natural. It is the natural progression once we give birth. That definitely doesnt make it easy! Its easily the hardest yet most rewarding thing I have done/am doing. It forces me to look at myself, to check what I am doing, to learn and try new techniques every single day. Mothering through breastfeeding has been part of that.Breastfeeding is instinctual. There is no doubt about that. In that way it is the most natural thing in the world. We instinctively lift our babies to our hearts. Is it a coincidence that is where the breast is? Our babies instinctively root and latch if we give them the right habitat and triggers. That doesnt mean that it is easy.I frequently talk to mums about the process of walking. Walking is natural, but thats because weve had a few decades of practice. Its natural to a 5 yr old too, again through practice. Its natural to a 2 yr old, although their running gait may be not what you will see in an older child  it is still developing. Is it natural to a 12 month old? The urge to get up and walk certainly is natural. The instinct to do it is there, but the process of walking?  usually not. The mechanics of shifting of weight, of moving each foot, getting the balance, moving the next foot? That takes some time. It takes several weeks. It takes a steadying hand. It also takes observation. Those babies are watching us. They see us walk. They see the neighbours walk, their siblings, cousins, children in the street, the postman, shop assistants, their peers and even their pets! All the time everyone around is encouraging our toddler. They help her to her feet and they are happy to provide that steadying hand. They praise and ooh, and ahh when steps are taken. They show visible delight on their faces. When the toddler falls, there is a quick, oh dear, all fall down or something along those lines, they pop the child up again and off they go. No one tells that toddler that it would be easier just to crawl, or to be carried. No one worries that falling will dent the childs confidence in her ability to walk. It is accepted as part of the process. When learning a new skill, gradual progress is what is understood to be happening. Some days are better than others, but the movement of the skill is forward overall.There is no other skill where we expect we should have a sudden knowledge and ability, in the way that we do about breastfeeding. No one expects that they will buy a piano (with no prior knowledge) and be able to play a concerto a week later. They dont feel they have failed when they cant do it. No one expects that they will be fluent in another language in a day or 2, even though language is natural. No one even expects they could run a 5k without a couch to 5k program. Why on earth do we feel that we are failing if we have problems doing something that we have never done before, rarely see done around us, and havent really any knowledge of?The truth is that everyone struggles in the early days. Maybe in different ways. Some may have issues with getting a deep latch. Some may struggle with the intensity of their babys needs. Some may struggle with a sick baby, birth complications or a baby who isnt latching at all. Others may struggle with family pressures to allow others to feed. Everyone has their own struggles as the entire family dynamic shifts underneath you while you begin the steep learning curve of breastfeeding and parenting. Do you know what is the difference between the mums who continue to breastfeed for as long as they want and those who stop? Support!In Norway 98% of babies are breastfed. At 6 months old, 80% of babies are still breastfed. Norwegian women are no different to women in Northern Ireland. Ok, theres a possibility they are taller and blonder (have I hit enough stereotypes there??) but their breasts work in the same way to yours. The real difference is that breastfeeding is normal. It is seen. Children, teens and adults see it. We observe and we learn. I have never been to Norway but I have been involved in many breastfeeding support groups and what I know is that if a mum hits a problem and discusses with other mums she will hear, oh yes that happened to me. This is what helped, or read this article or, talk to this person. I suspect that culturally you hit a certain point where enough people are breastfeeding and expectations become more realistic and support options more well known.A message for todayIf you are reading this today and you are struggling, I want to say 3 things to you:1. Find your networkIf your family and friends network around you dont understand breastfeeding and arent actively supporting you, then expand your network. If you have a La Leche League group near you, go along. If you have another breastfeeding group near by, go. People are often hesitant to go to a breastfeeding group, but again that is just cultural lack of understanding. You likely wouldnt hesitate to go to a slimming club if you wanted to lose weight, or a running club if you wanted to do that couch to 5k. At the very least, youd likely find a running mate. What you will find at that support group are women  just like you. Some dealing with the same things, some with different things. Some who have just entered that phase of easy breastfeeding, some who have been feeding for a long time because once it is easy, it is SO easy. At a slimming club or a running club you may find women who have had a great week and others who have found it much tougher that week. What they have in common is that they are working, learning and progressing.Breastfeeding support groups are the same. As you go back regularly you will start to see new mums arrive. You will hear the same words that you arrived with, the same worries and problems. You will realise that you arent having those issues anymore. Sometimes retrospect is the only way we see our progress!If you dont have a local group near you, find one online. You will find good peer support online. You wont get the cup of tea and to actually see mums nursing their babies, but you will find friends and support and a chance to talk about what is going on. Women supporting each other is a wonderful thing. We are designed to do it, and we flourish and grow in that environment.2. Find your local IBCLCPeer support is a wonderful and absolutely vital thing, but if you are struggling, you also need more. You need someone who can recognise what is causing you to struggle and how to move you forward. You need someone who will listen to your concerns and will not minimise your struggles, but rather will support you emotionally as well as working on the breastfeeding issue. An IBCLC (international board certified lactation consultant) is the gold standard in breastfeeding support worldwide. An IBCLC will spend time with you, usually a couple of hours, usually in your home, working through your concerns, helping with positioning and latching, working through a care plan and a feeding plan where needed and will follow up with you to see that care plan through. When we have the NHS it can seem odd to look to the private sector for breastfeeding help, but unfortunately there are very few NHS IBCLCs in the community in Northern Ireland. Midwives and Health visitors just dont have the same training as an IBCLC, and may not always have the skills to help provide a breastfeeding solution. An IBCLC generally costs a small fraction of the cost of formula, bottles and teats in the first year and can often help to completely turn things around for you. If you are struggling, reach out. You deserve to enjoy this experience with your baby.3. Reframe the learning processA newborn feeds so frequently that if breastfeeding isnt going as you hoped, you are reminded about it over and over and over during the day. If you are having latching problems or pain, you experience it over and over as your baby feeds. It is easy, at the end of the day, to only see the problem and to allow the feeling of not being able to do it overwhelm you. Often mums describe feeling like they are failing their baby. When you are reaching the end of the day, look back and reframe what has happened that day. Psychologists describe 2 mindsets which people can adopt: a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.Reframe your day with a growth mindset. If your baby isnt latching, but is taking expressed milk  recognise that your baby is getting your milk, and remember the multitude of components within that milk which is designed solely for your baby. Your body is making each of those components for your baby. If your baby is latching but you are in pain, remember that both you and your baby are learning. Remember that x days / weeks ago you had never breastfed this baby. Remember that since that time your baby has been breastfeeding. Realise all that your baby has received at your breast  nourishment, comfort, physiological regulation (heart rate, temperature, breathing), emotional and physical security. If your baby hasnt been nursing exclusively and that is your goal, set it as a goal that you are progressing towards. Like any skill, progress isnt always in a straight line but when you look back you see it. Look back over the last week  do you see a change? This is still relevant after you have sought out breastfeeding support, as there will still be a period where you are both learning.Find the successes in your breastfeeding. If your baby fed well once that day  that is a success. If you are still committed to breastfeeding at the end of the day  that is a success. Concentrate on that success. A good IBCLC or breastfeeding counsellor will help you to find and celebrate the successes in your day. Work on the careplan that you have created with your IBCLC and remember that every skill takes practice. If you worked on new latching techniques in the session give yourself time for those new techniques to become more natural and easier for you. Everyone falls in the early days, but with the right support it gets better, and better.Give yourself time and be gentle and positive to yourself with your thoughts. You are not failing. You are learning.

Meet Our Sponsor: Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/meet-our-sponsor-sarah-wells/,"Our sponsor for the month is Sarah WellsBreast Pump Bags. Sarahwould like to introduce you to herproductsMy Breastfeeding Story: Two Paths, One JourneyBy Sarah Wells, CEO & Founder, Sarah Wells Breast Pump BagsKeep going. Keep going. Keep going. This was what my breast pump said to me on good days. This sucks. This sucks. This sucks, was what that square yellow milk box said most of the time while exclusively pumping for my daughter, Maddy. My first breastfeeding journey was a tough one. Born just shy of 42 weeks, Maddy came out resistant to latching (fussy at the breast, sleepy at the breast, generally disinterested with my breasts). Five years later, not much has changed: she still just eats to live. Her interests lie far more in imaginary play and talking with me, than sharing a meal together.Back in the newborn days, I was beyond frustrated, disappointed, confused (and maybe even a little off-put by Maddys lack of interest  did she not want to be close to me in this way?). I also had a labor and delivery nurse whodashed my confidence from the get-go (No, you are not doing that right, she said in response to my excitement to show her I was breastfeeding; and then she walked away, while I unlatched Maddy and sat there confused). I sought professional lactation support in the hospital and at home. The IBCLCs that visited with me were fantastic,but it just wasnt working out for my mental health. So I turned to pumping. For six long months I fed Maddy solely breastmilk from my pumping efforts. It was exhausting, tedious, boring, and a proud accomplishment.Sarah Wells Bags. Photography by Tiffany Farley.Along the way, as an exclusively pumping mom running a national healthcare organization, I found myself daydreaming of ways to make pumping easier. And one particular idea  a better breast pump bag  gained interest from friends and colleagues alike. A member of my new moms group, who also had significant experience with building businesses, suggested I explore a functional, designer breast pump bag as a real path for myself. Fast forward two years of prototyping, legal paperwork, a trip abroad to find a manufacturer, and lots of conversations with other pumping moms, I launched Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags. Im now coming up to my third anniversary in 2016; its been an incredible ride. The absolute best part of this job is supporting other moms in their pumping experience, however much or little pumping that entails. And these moms support me too, by becoming amazing loyal customers of my bags, and also this past year as I welcomed my second child.Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags.In August 2015, Abigail was born. Ill be honesteven with a great bag, and all the other products that have come out over the last five years to make pumping easier, Ill be the first to admit that pumping isnt easy. I was dreading being an exclusively pumping mom again. I think pumping of any amount is a mixed emotional experience: proudanddetermined to do it meets really, I have to do this againand againand again? This time around I did do things a bit differently in terms of my approach to breastfeeding. First, I relaxed. This is a benefit of second time motherhoodfar fewerunknowns, and far greater ability to chill out about everything. I did some research on breastfeeding where there were gaps in my knowledge from the first time around (for instance, I watched YouTube videos like crazy about more natural breastfeeding positions since, with Maddy, I let my Type A personality take over in trying to be very regimented in how I did it). I also surrounded myself with support. I am lucky to have gained a few lactation professionals as friends and colleagues through my business venture, and I had them on-call via text and phone throughout the early days with Abby.Abby was born on her due date, and after delayed cord cutting and attention to my medical care, I put her to the breast. WOW! I am here to tell you that every kid has a different personality, even when it comes to breastfeeding. When I lifted Abby up to bring her to my chest she was already sucking into the air. The (phenomenally supportive) labor and delivery nurse remarked, That kid wants to eat! She latched. Six months later, today, were breastfeeding on demand (a lucky situation which results from working from home and being my own boss!) with pumping sprinkled in so mama can have some personal time.Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags.I quite honestly never believed Id latch a baby. I didnt admit that out loud before Abby was born, but it was in my head. The joy, the sheer joy of having this nursing experience, is indescribable. But I also want to say here: my experience with Abby nursing so easily and beautifully does not trump my experience with Maddy. Exclusively pumping was MUCH more difficult on every level. And truthfully, it wasnt nearly as lovely as cuddling a warm baby at my breast. But Maddy gave me something else: she showed me that I can persevere to achieve my goals under very stressful conditions. Maddy and I bonded differently, as every drop of milk I pumped was precious hard work and watching her take those bottles joined us together in a unique and special way. Plus, my breastfeeding journey with Maddy is what inspired and jumpstarted my business of selling stylish, functional breast pump bags, which has totally transformed my life.Thanks, Maddy and Abby. One of you may still not enjoy eating and may have caused mom some gray hairs over all of this, but both of you being who you are, and me being who I am then and now, led me to this awesome place as entrepreneur and proud breastfeeding mom by two paths, and Im forever grateful for all of it.Sarah Wells is offering a special discount for KellyMom readers: 15% off all breast pump bags and accessories on Amazon.com using the code U6W4IBN5 through April 30, 2016 at 11:59pm ET.Click here to shop Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags on Amazon.comAbout Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags:Image  Sarah WellsAfter the birth of her daughter, Sarah had her entrepreneurial light bulb moment and launched Sarah Wells Breast Pump Bags, based on a stylish and functional designer handbag that replaces the frustrating tradition of carrying a cheap vinyl breast pump bag.

Meet Our Sponsor: Freemie,http://kellymom.com/sponsors/meet-our-sponsor-freemie/,"Our sponsor for the month is Freemie. They would like to introduce you to their productsDo you have trouble making enough time or finding the right space to pump effectively at work? Consider pumping while doing your job.Freemies hands-free pumping systemFreemie breast pump collection cups are a hands free and concealable system designed to be used with most popular breast pumps. If you arent able to pump as often or as long as you need to at work, this might be the tool youre missing. Freemie cups allow you to pump when you need to, wherever you need to.It is important to understand that you do not have to buy a whole new pump to be able to use the Freemie system if you already have a compatible pump. Instead of using the traditional horns and bottles that came with your Freemie compatible pump, you connect the Freemie cups to your pump, and slip the cups up into your bra. Your milk collects inside the Freemie cups. Most bras can easily be adjusted to comfortably hold the Freemie cups in place, or you may have maternity bras that will work well. Many pumping bras also work!How does the system work?Each Freemie cup has a funnel and valve integrated into the cup assembly, so they feel and work just like regular breast pump equipment when placed over your breasts. But instead of milk falling down and hanging in bottles below the funnels, it collects in cups that surround the funnels. This more intuitive form makes the Freemie cups much more comfortable than any other hands free pumping system. Your bra is supporting a shape it was designed to support, so the weight of the collecting milk is hardly noticeable.The cups are intended to be used right underneath regular clothing. But they are large enough to hold eight ounces of milk, and they do surround a deep breast funnel, which is necessary to effectively express milk. If you wear looser tops with quick and easy access to slip the cups in and out of your bra, theres a good chance in many environments that nobody will even know what youre doing. But if coworkers do notice, they probably wont care. And theres a good chance that they might appreciate that youre not taking extra breaks to pump, even though you may be entitled to them. (The major benefit to you, of course, is that hopefully youll be heading out the door at the same time as everyone else, with your work done for the day, and heading home to your baby!)Positioning the Freemie cups in your bra for an effective pumping session is important. Remember, you need to get your bra to do the job that your hands were doing, so pay attention to this part: After making sure youve selected the right funnel (and funnel fit is important, so if you need a size that isnt available, unfortunately this system is not recommended) experiment with different brasyou have to see which one gets you a good seal, and positions the cups very comfortably so that you are effectively emptying milk from all your ducts. (For more on this subject, read here: Factors That May Affect Your Milk Production). Constantly pay attention to this part of the process, as making milk is a daily exercise, and your body changes over time. Breast pumps are almost never as effective as your infant, and you may need to utilize several different tools and techniques to maintain your milk supplyduring your breastfeeding journey. You may be able to pump exclusively with Freemie cups, but if the funnel fit or positioning isnt perfect for you, then consider whether you should only use them during those times when you have to pump around other people or need to be hands free, or to relieve engorgement, but then use other traditional hand held funnels during a later pump session.The Freemie cups tubing attaches to the tubing of your pump with simple quick connectors. By using each Freemie cups 24 inches of tubing and your pumps tubing together, you can conveniently place your pump so that it is not in your way, and allows you room to function. You may even want to place it under a desk or behind some other obstacle to help to muffle or deflect any noise the pump makes. When youre ready to get going, turn on the pump, and get back to work. When youre done pumping, turn off the pump. If your situation allows you to keep working on something before you wrap up the pump session, you can let that last letdown of milk collect for a few minutes, with the pump turned off, before you take the cups out.Transferring milk is easy; the notch in the cups that the tubing goes into becomes a pour spout when the cups are full. Pull the tubing out, but dont take the cups apart. This allows you to hold the cup securely while youre pouring the milk, and the spout creates a nice tight stream of milk. Practice this with water so you get the hang of it before doing it with your milk the first time.How can theFreemie systemimprove your pumping routine?One big advantage of the Freemie cups, for many women, is the opportunity to take the time pressure out of pumping. Pumping the Freemie way may allow you to relax while you pump and do time-consuming work simultaneously, rather than taking a quick pumping break before you begin tasks that are hard to interrupt. This capability can help women eliminate the need to rush through a pumping session. Some moms feel their situation forces them to turn up the pump a little higher than is comfortable or effective. But if you can pump without taking a break, what difference does it make if you pump for 5 minutes, or 45 minutes?Angie H, pumping with the Freemie system in a busy call center in ME. Photo used with permission.If you begin pumping with the Freemie system, you may find that many routine daily workplace negotiations  some of which you may dread  regarding your personal pumping needs are no longer necessary. Whether it is the need to schedule a specific break time with coworkers or supervisors, or the need to use someones private office if a dedicated pumping space isnt available, the elimination of these negotiations can be hugely beneficial for you and the support you get in the workplace. Not only can you simplify the logistics of pumping, and eliminate headaches and tensions in the workplace, but you can more easily adapt the times you pump to optimize your productivity on all fronts.Stories abound from women who have to go to a different floor in the building they work in  or a different building altogether  just to find a private space to pump. They might spend half of their allotted pumping time just traveling to an appropriate space to pump. Imagine the liberation if it is okay to pump in your cubicle or workstation!Now, are you wondering if your company will let you pump at your workstation? In most workplaces, women dont even need to ask. But if you are unsure, go ahead andask. (It should be an easy sell.)Kelly, R., Air Force Technical Sergeant, E-6. Photo used with permission.Pumping without taking extra breaks makes great sense if you can make it work in your situation. Youll get more work done in less time on the job each day, and get home to your family quicker. Moms should be able to bring home the milk with the bacon without adding any time to the work day.Lastly, there are some advantages to the Freemie system at home that many find useful: Because of the shape of the Freemie cups, you can double pump and hold your baby very comfortably at the same time, without baby getting distracted by milk bottles. But one of the most popular uses of the Freemie cups at home involves pumping with a single cup. Imagine comfortably pumping one breast while simultaneously nursing baby on the other breast. We call this, Freemie Feeding. Many working moms say this technique allows them to sleep in a little longer in the morning, because they pump during the morning feed. Before Freemie cups, these moms said they would spend 15 or 20 minutes pumping after nursing the baby before heading out the door for work. That meant getting up 15 or 20 minutes earlier. For many women with a new baby in the house, those few extra minutes of sleep are a big deal.Many women who must return to work after having a baby are not able to sustain breastfeeding as long as they would like. Often, this is due to diminishing milk supply, resulting from inadequate pumping. It is just too hard for many women to find an adequate space and carve out enough time at work to pump as much as they should. Freemie cups dramatically change the possibilities. Moms can pump more often and longer if they need to, without adding any significant time to their workday. Some moms tell us the Freemie cups save them as much as an hour each work day.Do you need Freemie cups?Update: Congratulations toFreemie,Winner of the Best New Baby Eats Technology at the 2016 CES The Bump Baby Tech Show in Las Vegas!About Freemie: The Freemie system was created by my wife, Dr. Stella Dao and myself, after the premature birth of our twins. Dr. Dao is board certified in Emergency Medicine and practices in Northern California. Our twins, at just over three pounds each and in the NICU for six weeks, were too weak to nurse, so Stella was pump dependent. Her workplace and our family situation made clear that the tools needed to sustain breastfeeding in the modern world did not yet exist.We founded DAO Health with the goal to transform the global infant feeding culture, by altering the economics of breast milk production. We believe that families everywhere need tools adapted to the modern economy to help them to feed their babies a healthier diet. Producing breast milk while separated from baby, for working women, is a lot of extra work  and time is money. We believe we can increase breastfeeding rates by reducing the actual cost to produce breast milk  when accounting for moms time  below the cost of formula. We can do this by providing moms with the necessary tools to produce milk efficiently.We launched our Freemie family of products in late 2013 in the United States. Now, Freemie cups are already available in more than a dozen countries, and were picking up speed!

Sadness and depression during (and after) weaning,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/wean-how/depression-and-weaning/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC, Becky Flora, IBCLC and Paula YountIts not unusual to feel tearful, sad or mildly depressed after weaning; some mothers also experience irritability, anxiety, or mood swings. These feelings are usually short-term and should go away in a few weeks, but some mothers experience more severe symptoms that require treatment. If youre experiencing feelings that are affecting your quality of life for more than a couple of weeks, it would be a good idea to seek outside help.What causes these mood changes?There is very little research on the subject, but its hypothesized that hormonal changes are a primary cause of mood changes during and after weaning. One of the changes that occurs with weaning is a drop in prolactin and oxytocin levels. Prolactin, a hormone that is required for milk production, also brings with it a feeling of well-being, calmness and relaxation. Oxytocin, the hormone that is required for milk ejection (let-down), is sometimes referred to as the love hormone. It makes sense that a sudden decrease in these hormones could have an effect on a weaning mothers emotions.Are some mothers more likely to experience depression due to weaning?The faster the weaning process the more abrupt the shift in hormone levels, and the more likely that you will experience adverse effects. Dropping no more than one feeding per week is gentler on both mother and baby. Mothers who are forced to wean before they are ready (or for reasons beyond their control) and mothers with a history of depression are also more likely to experience depression after weaning.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Even for mothers who feel ready for weaning and wean gradually, there may still be some sense of loss and sadness. Weaning marks the end of a physical oneness with your child, the close of a very special period in your lives.

Sore nipples or breasts? Here’s help…,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/sore-nipples-breasts/,"Is nipple pain normal in the early weeks?Some mothers never experience any nipple pain at all, but studies show that the majority of women in the US and other western countries do have some nipple pain in the beginning. How do we tell the difference between this typical nipple pain and a problem that would benefit from the help of an experienced breastfeeding counselor and/or IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant)?Typical nipple pain (transient soreness) that does not usually indicate a problem:Latch-on pain that lasts no more than 30 seconds into the feeding. This is often described as mild pain or discomfort, but since the pain sensation is very subjective every mother experiences pain differentlysome mothers feel more severe pain. The pain should not continue through the entire feeding, and there should not be pain between feedings.Pain usually peaks around the third day after birth, and is gone within two weeks.There is no skin damage  no cracks, blisters, or bleeding.Your nipple should look the same before and immediately after the feeding  not flattened, creased or pinched.Get help froman experienced breastfeeding counselor and/or IBCLC if you experience the following:Intense, excruciating painPain thatcontinues through the entire feedingPain between feedingsPain that continues past the first couple of weeksSkin damagecracks, blisters, or bleedingIf youre experiencing any of the above issues, then dont let someone tell you that everything looks fine  it is either a sign that damage is being done or of some underlying condition (infection, etc.).If youre experiencing pain that makes you dread feeding your baby or that you describe as excruciating or if you have cracked or bleeding nipples, then this is NOT the norm and there is almost always something that can be done to address the issue and to alleviate the pain. Please do not assume this is normal and just suffer through it  ask for help! It doesnt mean youre doing something wrong  there can be many causes, from anatomical issues to infection. Cracking, bleeding or any other nipple damage is not normal  something is causing the damage and pain, and a good IBCLC can help you to find the cause. Seeing a knowledgeable breastfeeding professional could make all the difference.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Some things to investigate if you have nipple pain:Did breastfeeding get painful when your milk came in? Engorgement can make it difficult for baby to latch deeply. Reverse pressure softening or expressing a little milk can help baby get a deeper latch that does not hurt.Does your nipple look flattened, creased, or pinched when baby unlatches? Can you see a white line across the nipple when baby unlatches? This is usually the sign of a shallow latch. A shallow latch can usually be remedied by adjusting latching technique, but it can also be caused by anatomical variations in mom or baby.Do you have skin damage (bruising, cracks, blisters/blebs, bleeding)? While you investigate and address the cause of the damage, use these tipsHealing damaged skin in the nipple area.Some potential causes of nipple pain and damage include:shallow latch, babys lips tucked inward instead of flanged outward when breastfeeding, removing baby from the breast without first breaking the suction;unusual infant anatomy such astongue-tie or lip-tie, unusual palate shape, receding chin, short tongue;strong/unusualsuckling;jawclamping/clenching;unusual nipple anatomy such asinverted or flat nipples, very long, or large nipples.Do you have a rash on the nipple or areola? Contact dermatitis (from breast pads, nipple creams, soaps/detergents, etc.), eczema, psoriasis, poison ivy/oak can all be present on the nipple or breast and cause sore nipples.Are you using a breast pump? Incorrectly sized pump flanges, too-high suction settings, or too-slow cycling settings can cause nipple pain or damage.Are you experiencing pain between feedings (in addition to or instead of during feedings)? Investigate thrush (yeast infection)and nipple blanching (turning white) and vasospasm.Do you have a forceful milk ejection/let-down reflex? Some babies will clamp down on the nipple to slow the milk flow, causing pain.Has the pain started after weeks or months with no issues?

Engorgement typically begins on the 3rd to 5th day after birth, and subsides within 12-48 hours if properly treated (7-10 days without proper treatment).Read more about minimizing and treating engorgement here: Engorgement.See alsoEngorgementwhen tandem breastfeeding.Breast painFollowing are some things to investigate if you are experiencing breast pain.Engorgement(in addition to appearing during the first week, you may also experience engorgement if you skip a breastfeeding session or wait too long between breastfeeding sessions)Plugged Ducts and Mastitisare the most common causes of breast pain in breastfeeding mothers (other than engorgement).Breast pain is sometimes associated with aforceful milk ejection/let-down reflex and oversupply. This pain will appear when the milk lets down, soon after the feeding begins; it usually decreases over time and is gone within the first month after birth.Raynauds phenomenon/vasospasm can cause deep breast pain.Some breast pain might also be caused by a tightening of the chest muscles leading to a reduced blood flow to the breast and nipples. Edith Kernerman, IBCLC has hypothesized anddescribed this set of symptoms, calledmammary constriction syndrome (read more about it here), which is treated with pectoral muscle massage.Sometimes breast pain may be referred pain from nipple trauma or a muscle strain or injury.A badly fitting bra or tight straps on a baby carrier can cause shooting breast pains.Breastfeeding mothers may also experience premenstrual breast pain or fibrocystic breast pain.Have you had breast surgery or a breast injury in the past? Internal scarring can sometimes cause pain, as can a ruptured breast implant.Mothers with very large breasts sometimes experience muscle strain due to the weight of their breasts, which may be relieved with a well-fitting bra.Thrush (yeast infection)may cause breast pain along with other symptoms (shiny or flaky skin on the nipple/areola, nipple pain) but breast pain is unlikely to be the only symptom of thrush.More resources:Breast pain from La Leche League InternationalBerens P, et al.ABM Clinical Protocol #26: Persistent Pain with Breastfeeding.Breastfeed Med. 2016 Mar;11(2):46-53. doi: 10.1089/bfm.2016.29002.pjb.

Why I Celebrated World Breastfeeding Week,http://kellymom.com/health/baby-health/breastfeeding-my-type-1-diabetic-baby/,"Breastfeeding my Type 1 Diabetic BabybyBrittany FenstermakerI was three years old when my sister was born. I dont have many memories ofmyself at that age, but I do know that I was excited that there was going to bea baby. I could not wait to be a Little Mommy to a real, pinky, squishyinfant. To help me feel part of the process, my parents bought me a baby doll,whom I named Sarah. I can still smell the powder-fresh, newborn-scented plastic.That doll went everywhere with me for years. I changed her, bathed her, anddressed her, just like my mom did with my baby sister. I even sat in my chair,delicately lifted my Little Mermaid t-shirt, and nursed my Sarah doll. Nursing my baby boy then and now.There was nothing unnatural or strange about it to me. My mom breastfed me and Iwatched her do the same with my sister. I never considered feeding my babies anyother way. And when I became pregnant with my first child in 2011, I spent hourswondering what it would feel like to hold a suckling infant at my own breast. Iagonized at the thought that I might not be able to nurse; it seemed likeeveryone had their own opinions and reasons for being unable to breastfeed andnone of them were shy in expressing that to me. What if I didnt have enoughsupply? What if something went wrong? What if it just didnt work out? I read and studied so many books, and despite support and encouragement from both myhusband and mom, I shook inside at my sons first visit to the pediatrician. Iwas terrified I would be told he wasnt gaining weight, terrified to beinstructed to supplement with formula. I breathed a sigh of relief when thedoctor said he was growing beautifully. It wasnt until half-way through mysons first year that I stopped worrying about hearing those words. We did it!Together we had established a healthy and strong nursing relationship! Sostrong, in fact, that he still asks for nanos at nearly three years old. Wehave well surpassed my breastfeeding goals and I couldnt be happier!Siblings bond over tandem nursing.When I became pregnant with my second child, a girl, the fears and anxiety surrounding breastfeeding were all but a distant and faint memory. I never actually stopped making milk, so I knew there would be plenty to go around once the baby came. And there was! I was now tandem nursing my two-year-old and newborn. Another healthy nursling was added to the mix, and it was a beautiful thing.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The day before Baby Girl's diagnosis.  She just wasn't herself.Then one day, the thing that I both took for granted and treasured with all my heart was threatened. It was early June of 2014 and my nine-month-old daughter became ill. We thought she caught a stomach bug that was going around, so we monitored her closely for the rest of the weekend. She was acting strange, and we contemplated taking her to an urgent care. We decided that since there was no fever and she was still nursing and voiding often, we would wait to take her to the pediatrician first thing Monday morning.When the office opened, I called to make the appointment and started getting ready. She had been so fussy and just wanted to be held. I stepped away from her crib to quickly change. When I came back, I knew in my heart that something was horribly wrong. Her rosy, pink cheeks were sunken deep and her bright eyes were dark and unresponsive. Then, I noticed her breaths were deep and labored, exposing her delicate skeletal frame beneath her sleeper. At this point, I was terrified to put her in the car for fear that she would fall asleep and never wake up.Just before calling the ambulance--the picture I texted my husband while he was at work.Waiting for the ambulance to arrive was the longest 8 minutes of my life. As I tried to keep my little girls limp body conscious, I flipped into survival mode. I felt as numb and lifeless as she looked and there was nothing I could do except keep calling her name to keep her awake. When the volunteer paramedics arrived they gave her blow-by oxygen and they assured me that her heart rate and pulse were all normal. I breathed a sigh of relief. They instructed me to continue to keep her awake as we climbed in the ambulance. I took comfort in knowing we would be traveling without sirens. My husband rushed home from work and made it in time to follow us to the childrens hospital in Akron.At the emergency room, it took under five minutes for our baby girl to be given a diagnosis of the auto-immune disease, type-one diabetes. I agonized as I quickly asked the attending ER doctor if it was our fault, but I knew that it wasnt. My daughter was still basically exclusively breastfed, as she really wasnt interested in solids yet and there is no known cause to this chronic medical condition. Once she had a central line put in and IV fluids were started, I asked when I could nurse her. I didnt get a straight answer and I felt paralyzed with fear as I flashed back to our last nursing session. It was hurried. I was trying to get her to breastfeed before we left for the doctors office, but she really wasnt interested. She was so unaware of her surroundings at the time and I remember being concerned. It was at that point that I thought, What if that was the last time I will ever nurse her again? I knew that diabetes required careful attention to what was consumed. What if they made me switch to formula so we could accurately count the carbs my daughter would consume? What if I had to become an exclusive pumper so they could track how many ounces she drank? I tried to push the thought out of my head. We had only just arrived at the hospital and they were transferring us to the pediatric intensive care unit. I would find out there. I settled on asking for a pump. I was so engorged from our shortened earlier nursing and I made up my mind to have milk ready for her when the time came. I had to keep stimulating to make sure I had milk when she was ready for it.It wasnt until we got to the PICU that I realized just how serious things were and how close we were to losing our little girl. It was surreal listening to the attending physician ask questions of the medical students and discuss her treatment. For the first time that day, I was truly scared that she might not make it. She was in diabetic ketoacidosis and her blood sugar was in the 600s. Her electrolytes were all out of whack and she was lethargic and mostly unresponsive. I also quickly learned that once her levels were stabilized, managing her new medical condition would be much more difficult than I had originally anticipated. I emphatically told our nurse that our daughter was exclusively breastfed. She told me that for now, she was getting what she needed through her IV. I asked if and when I would ever be able to nurse again. My heart sank when she said she didnt know, but that she would find out. I prepared myself for the worst and began to mourn the loss of nursing my baby girl. I felt a twinge of guilt for feeling so defeated. She was alive, after all, but one of the most important parts of our current relationship was being threatened and was on the verge of extinction. I was devastated.First bottle of pumped breast milk.I honestly cant remember how long it took to get an answer, but it felt like forever. In the meantime, I conducted my own research. Google was futile. It was as if there were no records of nursing a child with type one. I finally stumbled upon a Facebook group for parents of type one children. They directed me to the group Diapers and Diabetes, where many other moms continued to breastfeed their type ones after diagnosis. Approval to join the group took a day or two, so I couldnt ask any questions yet, but just knowing there were others brought peace to my soul. The nurse finally found out that once our daughter was stable and connected to her insulin pump, I could put her to my breast. Until then, I could give her a bottle of pumped milk and report how many ounces she drank. It was an emotional moment when I gave her her first bottle of milk. She basically inhaled three bottles worth. My heart was happy and I knew hers was, too. First latch after receiving her insulin pump.  I don't know who was happier!The next day, Baby Girl was acting much more like herself and she knew that the bottle wasnt her mommy  she refused to drink it! We were scheduled to get her on her insulin pump in a few hours and both of us couldnt wait. The breast pump was no longer effective in producing much milk and I wanted to be sure I wouldnt lose my supply. Our nurse and pump educator were wonderful and worked together to get Little Miss nursing as quickly as possible. Finally, after over 24 hours, my baby nursed from my breast again. Just the day before, I thought I would never be able to experience this moment with my daughter again. The ecstasy of that moment was indescribable.Packing up to head home!So, this World Breastfeeding Week, I celebrated that I can still nurse my daughter in the manner in which we first started. I celebrated that despite this horrible disease, I can still nourish her in the way we choose. I celebrated that despite our lives being turned upside down, my daughter and I can still bond at my breast. I celebrated that I can give her an extra line of defense against illness, especially since she is now more susceptible to difficulties that accompany a simple cold or flu. I celebrated because every time I give her insulin for the breast milk she is consuming, I am reminded of how close we were to losing this part of our relationship. And I continue to celebrate, because no nursing mother of a child with type one diabetes should have to give that up no matter what.Signs and Symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes include excessive thirst, excessive urination, weight loss, and extreme hunger.  If breath smells fruity, there is vomiting, and/or deep, rapid breathing, head to emergency immediately!  With our daughter, I mistakenly thought the leaks in her cloth diapers were because I was washing them incorrectly or putting them on her the wrong way.  In hindsight, she was wetting through them quickly because of her high blood sugars!  The first sign we saw was the vomiting, which we attributed to a stomach bug that had been going around.  It is so difficult to diagnose babies with Type 1.  You know your child best.  If he or she is just not acting him/herself, seek medical attention.  We have set up a non-profit to raise awareness for Type 1.  Check out www.facebook.com/jamforjoyt1d.

Your Rights As a Breastfeeding Employee,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/employed-moms/your-rights-as-a-breastfeeding-employee/,"by theUnited States Breastfeeding CommitteeKnowing your rights as a breastfeeding employee and early communication with your employer are some of the key steps to planning a successful transition back to work. Since 2010, the federal Break Time for Nursing Mothers law has helped make breastfeeding and working possible for more moms across the country. The law requires employers to provide break time and a private place for hourly paid employees to pump breast milk during the work day.If you are not covered by the federal law, dont panic. Contact your state or local breastfeeding coalition to find out if you are covered by a state law, and join the United States Breastfeeding Committee (USBC) in the fight to extend workplace breastfeeding protection to more employees by asking your legislators to cosponsor the Supporting Working Moms Act.Key Facts about the Break Time for Nursing Mothers Law:Who is covered: The law applies to nonexempt (hourly) employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.Space: Employers are required to provide a place that is not a bathroom. It must be completely private so that no one can see inside. Employers are not required to create a permanent dedicated space for breastfeeding employees. As long as the space is available each time you need it, your employer is meeting the space requirements.Time: The law requires employers to provide reasonable break time, recognizing that how often and how much time it takes to pump is different for every mother. Employers must provide time and space each time you need it. To maintain your supply, you will need to pump as often as your baby usually eats. To estimate how much time you will need, remember to consider all the steps you will need to take, including the time it will take to gather your pumping supplies, get to the space, pump, clean up, and return to your workspace. The law does not require pumping breaks to be paid, however if your employer already offers paid breaks and you use those breaks to pump your milk, your time should be paid in the usual way.Enforcement: The U.S. Department of Labors Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law. For help, call the toll-free WHD number 1-800-487-9243. You will then be directed to your nearest WHD office for assistance.Small Businesses: All employers, regardless of their size or number of employees, must comply with the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law. Following a complaint from a breastfeeding employee, businesses with fewer than 50 employees may be able to apply for an undue hardship exemption. To receive an exemption for that employee, the employer must prove that providing these accommodations would cause significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to the size, financial resources, nature, or structure of the employers business. Until they are granted an exemption by the Department of Labor, they must comply with the law.The Break Time for Nursing Mothers law was an important victory for families, but breastfeeding success shouldnt depend on a moms job type. The Supporting Working Moms Act would expand the existing federal law to cover approximately 12 million salaried employees, including elementary and secondary school teachers. By raising our voices together, we can create the lasting change families need. Use USBCs easy action tool to ask your legislators to cosponsor the Supporting Working Moms Act with just a few clicks.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Breastfeeding and working is not only possible, its good for business.

On the Trail of Code Compliancy,http://kellymom.com/bf/advocacy/trail-of-code-compliancy/,"by Marsha Walker, RN, IBCLCReprinted with permission from the USLCA February 2012 eNewsList of companies updated1/11/2016Wondering what the Code is? Read this first!NABAKeeping up with which companies are meeting their obligations under the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code) can be a daunting task. Who is compliant and who is not is constantly changing, especially as companies merge, enter marketing agreements, or acquire subsidiaries. Companies who are owned by Code violators are considered the same as their parent. The lineage of manufacturers and distributors of products covered by the Code must be kept in mind. So long as any company is found to be a Code violator, sponsorship is not accepted from its parent or subsidiary company even though the parent or subsidiary company may not be a Code violator.In the case of a subsidiary company, the parent company is in control of the subsidiarys policies and practices and there is advantage in keeping the subsidiarys record relatively clean so that health workers can work with the subsidiary while the parent company continues to violate the Code. Strategically, it means one company benefits from endorsements by health workers because it is Code compliant while the other continues to reap the benefits of aggressive promotion. Since the decision makers of both companies are one and the same, the parent company must not be allowed to take advantage of the goodwill that the subsidiary may receive from health workers as a result of any sponsorship they offer. Using the corporate veil to shield one arm of a group of companies from possible wrongful deeds of another is unethical and would exonerate the parent company from its responsibilities under the Code. There is a compelling case to lift the corporate veil to protect infant health and health care providers are encouraged to do so. Companies must not be rewarded for poor corporate behavior.Creating a list of companies who are Code violators and who are not Code violators is difficult at best, but below is a selected list of a few companies who are and are not Code violators that may be involved with infant feeding. Hopefully, this is helpful to readers. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.Code violators:(revised 1/11/2016)All infant formula companiesBoppy(owned by the Artsana Group, maker of Chicco branded infant products which are marketed in a Code violating manner)Dr. Browns(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)Evenflo(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)The First Years(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)Kiinde(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)Lansinoh(owned by Pigeon, a Code violator and markets the mOmma bottle in a Code violating manner)Medela(markets the Calma feeding bottle and nipple in a Code violating manner)Phillips Avent(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)Playtex(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)Rumble Tuff(markets an infant feeding bottle in a Code violating manner)Tommee Tippee(markets infant feeding bottles in a Code violating manner)Companies meeting their obligations under the Code:AmedaArdoBailey MedicalHygeiaLimerickLucinaPumpin PalSpectra Baby USA?(They appear to be OK in the US, howeverSpectra companies inother countries have violations.)Cottonwood Kids(as long as they are not including any Code violating products in their bags)Earth Mama Angel BabyMotherloveMy Brest FriendProlactaRuminaSnappiesSnugabellSeethe C.A.R.E Code Corporate Allianceand KellyMom Sponsors for more Code compliant companies_____________________________________________Want to find out more about the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes?What do I need to know about the WHO Code?Looking for WHO Code compliant companies?

Universal paid maternity leave in the US: What would it cost?,http://kellymom.com/blog-post/cost-maternity-leave/,"Theres been a lot of discussion about paid maternity leave in the US.According to Save the Childrens 2012 State of the Worlds Mothers Report:Image credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrPerhaps the most effective way to improve breastfeeding rates is to provide longer periods of paid maternity leave. Countries with generous maternity and parental leave policies  such as Denmark, Norway and Sweden  tend to have high breastfeeding rates Apart from the United States, all developed countries now have laws mandating some form of paid compensation for women after giving birth.As part of having an informed discussion, an idea of the costs should be included since part of implementing universal maternity leave includes collecting the money. I tried to find an estimate of the cost online, and was unsuccessful. Therefore, Im putting together my own estimate. This is not to advocate for or against the proposal, but it seems worthwhile to add the cost and method of funding to the discussion.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.To get a rough cost, lets make some assumptions about the program. Im not suggesting that this is the way that universal maternity leave should be handled  this is just meant to keep the calculations very simple (look at the end of this article to see some different options). If someone has a more in-depth estimate, let me know about it!Assumptions:Pay new mothers 75% of the median income for women for one year after birth.Pay ALL mothers, regardless of their work history.Paid Maternity Leave in Developed Countries - 2012Some of the Unknowns:How many women postpone children because they need to work? If a new mother will be financially supported for one year, will that increase the birth rate, and increase the costs of this program?Will there be any corresponding savings, such as those associated with increased breastfeeding rates decreasing medical costs?How much room is there for cost savings by putting a cap on eligibility by household income, requiring the mother to have worked a certain number of hours to qualify, etc.?Continuing to keep it simple, well assume that the unknown costs and savings cancel each other out.Lets run some numbers (all for the United States):Using the latest data available from the US governmentWomens median earnings: $669/week = $34,788 per year. Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics. http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswom2010.pdfIf new mothers are paid 75% of median income, that is $26,091 paid maternity leave per year per birth.Number of births per year: 4,316,000. Source: US Census. http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/11statab/vitstat.pdfThe total annual maternity leave for all births (paid maternity leave per year per birth times number of births per year): $112,608,800,000.If we assume, similar to Social Security, administrative costs are minimal (less than 1%), we can say $113 billion per year is the rough cost of this program.Now lets figure out what that number means in relation to the workforce.There are about 142 million people employed in the US. Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf.Dividing $113 billion by 142 million workers means the cost is $796 per worker per year.If we treat paid maternity leave similar to unemployment insurance and social security, then, based on our simplified estimate, $796 per worker per year (or $66 per month) will pay for it.Dont like the assumptions above? Using the same data, if we pay all new mothers 50% of the median income for women for 6 months, our simplified estimate gives a cost of $267 per worker per year (or $22 per month).If we include only the employed mothers (55.8% of mothers with babies under a year old are in the workforce  Source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics) and again give them 50% of the median income for women for 6 months, our simplified estimate gives us a cost of $149 per worker per year (or $12 per month).So here are the questions:Is this something that should be done?If so, is a payroll tax or fee (similar to Social Security or Unemployment) the way to fund it?For commenters: Keep the discussion civil, remember your manners, and stay on topic!

You Asked. They Answered. TIME’s AP moms take your questions.,http://kellymom.com/blog-post/time-apmoms-interview/,"For their May 21 cover story about Dr. Bill Sears and attachment parenting (AP), TIME Magazine took many photographs of four mothers and their children: Jamie Lynne Grumet of Los Angeles, Dionna Ford of Kansas City, Jessica Cary of Brooklyn, and Melinda Larson of Long Island. A photo of Jamie and her son was picked for the cover photo, and all of the moms were interviewed for an online article (though little of the material was actually used). The moms who were photographed asked KellyMom for a chance to bust some of the misconceptions about the TIME article. Since any of these moms could have ended up as the cover model, were thrilled to include all of them in our Q&A session.The magazine article, the headline Are You Mom Enough, and the publicity surrounding the image of Jamie nursing her 3 year old son have sparked an international conversation about both breastfeeding and attachment parenting, with lots of negative press. I was disappointed to see so many people in the press and elsewhere defining AP as something quite different than how most of us see it. After incorrectly defining it, they go on to criticize a straw man version of attachment parenting that doesnt even exist. For instance, I dont know any attachment parent who feels you must co-sleepand wear your baby in aslingfrom morn till night and breast-feed for years and never, ever let your baby cry.We asked readers of the KellyMom Facebook page what questions they would like to ask these moms. Following are their questions (many are amalgamations of several questions) and the responses from Jessica, Jamie, Melinda, and Dionna.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.First of all, Jamie, what misconceptions about the TIME cover picture featuring you and your son would you like to correct?TIME magazine cover, May 21, 2012 (TIME).Why did I (we) pick that shot for the cover? People assume I had creative control over the cover, which I did not. TIME chose the photo and the headline.Was I paid? Not a penny.Why did I let them pose me like that? I didnt. I have no problem being in a standing position, but the image they captured does not represent the vision and direction of the shoot (which was to convey confidence and contentment). A lot of people dont realize that many photographs are takenwhile moving around between positions. The picture TIME chose for the cover was one of these outtakes.During the shoot we grabbed a stool and got the shot that is seen in Lightbox (the one that represents better what happened in that room). My son had fallen asleep nursing at my breast in that shot. (The shoot was short but it was his nap time when we got there). The shot is lovely and it was actually this or a very similar photo that was going to be the cover image. The shot TIME eventually chose was confirmed as the cover photo shortly before release.I think the more nurturing shot still would have provoked the same uneducated and ignorant comments we have been hearing. However, a better tagline with a better picture (one that didnt reinforce breastfeeding myths) might have been more embraced by the AP community.1. How did TIME find and choose you?Jessica and family. Used with permission.Jessica ____________________An employee of the photographer TIME hired is a nursing mom who attends a local breastfeeding support group run by one of my friends. This mom reached out to the group, looking for a breastfeeding mom/child (3-5 years old) for a TIME magazine article on evolving parenthood. My friend forwarded that email to a small group of moms with older nurslings and I was on that list. I sent in a few pictures the next morning. Six hours later (Friday afternoon) I heard from an Associate Photo Editor at TIME who said they were interested in us participating in the shoot that was going to happen on Sunday. We were in!Jamie ____________________TIME contacted me by email with their phone number asking if I would be interested in participating in a photo shoot for a story they were doing on attachment parenting. I then found out the story was going to be about Dr. Bill Sears. It sounded like a celebratory story because it was the 20th anniversary of his first book release. The author from TIME spoke about being immersed in the topic, and appeared to have a lot of respect for Dr. Sears.Melinda and family. Used with permission.Melinda ____________________It really was a serendipitous type of a thing. A friend of a friend knew about the photo shoot in NY and thought that they would be interested in our family. I received a call from the photo editor on Friday and was at a photo shoot on Sunday.Dionna ____________________Time contacted me via email. TIMEs photo editor (Neil Harris) had emailed various bloggers in the attachment parenting/natural family living niche. The email specifically asked for families that were big proponents of attachment parenting, had one toddler, and preferably had two or more children. I called to refer several other bloggers I know who volunteer with NaturalParentsNetwork.com; but after Neil and I chatted for awhile, he asked me if my family would like to participate.Continue to Part 2 >>>>or Jump to a question:How did TIME find and choose you?What were you hoping to achieve by being a part of this and do you feel that you were successful in achieving your goals?What messages about attachment parenting and/or breastfeeding were you hoping TIME would convey in their article?What kind of reaction to the article were you expecting?

What messages about attachment parenting and/or breastfeeding were you hoping TIME would convey in their article? iStockphoto.com / Ksenia KozlovskayaJessica ____________________In my first conversation with TIME the photo editor explained that the article would be a profile of Dr. Sears and Attachment Parenting. My husband and I are attachment parenting, so I thought it was a perfect fit. From the little exposure I have to magazine/news coverage (I am a freelance writer), I went in without any expectations of what TIME would convey. I hoped it would be informative. I hoped it would paint AP as a back-to-basics type of childrearing. I hoped that it would be a counterpoint to the recent tough love / its not neglect if youre speaking french parenting books that have hit the parenting scene of late. I hoped that their profile of Dr. Sears would be balanced. I hoped that they wouldnt vilify breastfeeding older kids.Before I got to read the article, I watched a video of the articles author, Kate Pickert, online. From that two minute clip, I knew it wasnt going to be a balanced piece. How she described AP was misinformed and the language she used was sensationalistic.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Jamie ____________________My family was hoping this would be an outlet to show attachment parenting is a valid and normal parenting decision. There should be no shame in parenting your child this way.Melinda ____________________I was hoping that it would introduce attachment parenting, how it has grown and the community that it has created and leave it up to the individual to decide whether they wanted to support it or not.Dionna ____________________According to one survey, less than 10% of women nurse their children past 18 months. Because I write about breastfeeding past infancy on CodeNameMama.com, I get emails from women quite often who say thank you for letting me know it is ok and that Im not alone! I had hoped that the author of the article would write about how natural and healthy ecological breastfeeding is for both mother and child. While the cover story did not convey that message, I was happy to see that one of the side stories did work (somewhat) to normalize nursing past infancy.<<<< Previous |Continue to Part 4 >>>>FacebookPinterestTwitter"

How has reality compared to what you thought you could expect? drubig-photo - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________All of the attention was completely unexpected. I am just doing what has come naturally to me and my daughter. I breastfeed her. The fact that it was causing such an uproar was crazy. Or that a news van was parked outside our house all day until I came home with my little one (passed out in the stroller). It felt bizarre. I couldnt believe that breastfeeding my daughter was this much news.Jamie ____________________My family was prepared for backlash if our photo made it into the article or onto the cover. We felt this way even when we had the hope that TIME would select a more nurturing photo. People in our society are uncomfortable with the idea that breasts are biologically designed to breastfeed offspring. This is even more true past the first year.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The reaction to the article has been lackluster. However, the reaction to the cover has definitely been polarizing. I believe the tagline was the main reason for this. The reaction to Mom Enough caused an uproar and was viewed as pitting moms against each other. TIME using this article to play into the mommy wars was not one of the potential risks my husband and I addressed prior to the shoot.The reaction to me personally? I was expecting curiosity, but not as much personal attention as it seems we have ended up receiving. It was a risk we were willing to take in the hopes of doing something positive to normalize breastfeeding.Melinda ____________________I was expecting criticism, but proud to represent something that my husband and I truly believe in. For almost 7 years we have chosen to parent in a way that is different from our families and friends choices so we are used to the criticism. They way that the article was represented may have sparked a little more criticism than we imagined, but it is starting conversations about how we parent which will in turn eventually get the more positive message out there.Dionna ____________________We had no idea that the author was taking the particular slant she did with the article. In fact before agreeing to participate, I checked and double-checked with Neil Harris of TIME that attachment parenting and the families at the photo shoot would not be portrayed in a negative light. My husband and I never expected the reaction  but we would have never guessed that TIME was hoping to spin the feature as fuel for the mommy wars.

TIMEs AP moms take your questions.5. How do you feel about AP being portrayed as extreme? (TIME is not the only media outlet to do this)Image credit: Pullara on flickrJessica ____________________Its unfortunate. And I also understand why it can look this way. Our culture focuses on independence of babies from the moment they exit the womb. AP, to me, honors the way parenting children has been done over time, around the world  which is to keep babies close, respond to them, breastfeed them when theyre hungry. This seems to go against every fiber of our American way of being which wants mom to regain her sense of identity right away, have the baby get used to being on her own at three weeks or sleep down the hall (and through the night) so mom and dad can have time to themselves as soon as possible.Jamie ____________________That always bothers me. There is nothing extreme about the way we parent. I find it relaxed and natural.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Melinda ____________________Attachment Parenting, to some, does feel extreme because it is so selfless. Those who might label it that way could be afraid of it because it does take inner faith to trust your instincts rather than follow the crowd. No matter what you call it, those of us who have embraced attachment parenting did not do so because Dr. Sears told us to, we did it because our heart led us there. So no matter what label the media wants to give it, to us it is just parenting.Dionna ____________________Talking about attachment parenting as extreme is almost laughable for us. We think that most of what we do is easy.Breastfeeding? Easy! (after we got through the initial struggles)Cosleeping? Restful!Having baby in a carrier? Convenient!Treating my child gently and with respect? An investment in having a respectful child in the future!The media loves to paint things as extreme  its what gets the headlines. Those of us who identify as AP parents are doing much more to educate people about the realities of what life can be like. We just need to take the opportunity TIME has given us and turn it into something positive.<<<< Previous | Continue to Part 6 >>>>FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Used with permission.Jessica ____________________I wish that I had realized that balance was as key to a happy, healthy family as was responding with sensitivity. Im at home with my daughter. On the weekends, I love spending time with both her and my husband and when she was younger, I didnt want to leave and have time for myself. But, then, come Monday, I was exhausted and frazzled and really felt the need for time alone. Now, I make sure to make time  for meditation, for yoga, for taking myself out to lunch.When my daughter was a baby, it felt easy to respond to her with sensitivity. Now that shes almost three, it can be challenging in the face of emotional upsets and tantrums. Whats helped us is to focus on prevention  dont take her to the grocery store too close to nap time, etc. And its also been REALLY essential to me to have AP-minded folks in our life. My closest mommy friend (we met in our childbirth class) happens to practice AP and its been wonderful to have someone to support me, talk to, encourage, trade ideas, and challenge my old patterns along the way. Ive also connected to our local API support group that has a vibrant yahoo group and monthly meetings.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Jamie ____________________Dr. Sears talks about birth bonding, which I was not able to do. I had HELLP Syndrome with my pregnancy and my son was delivered 2 months premature. We were all so grateful he was born healthy at his gestational age. However, I was very sick (even after delivery) and I was not able to see him for three days. My husband, mom, dad, and sister-in-law (who is a pediatrician) took charge. My sister-in-law took a photo of my son in the NICU and brought it to me to help stimulate my milk. My husband would bring me the pump every two hours. If I was sleeping he took it upon himself to attach the pump for me so I could sleep through the pumping session. My parents and sister were my cheerleaders. They were so positive about being able to breastfeed and bond, but also were so great about understanding formula potentially could be an option, and there was no shame in using it if we needed it. We ended up not needing to use formula, but I think the encouragement from my family and knowing that no matter what, my son would be nourished, was what helped our breastfeeding story be successful.Melinda ____________________Attachment parenting is a constant growing and learning experience for everyone involved because it is a relationship. Being present and balancing has always been my struggle and as a parent continues to be. Through attachment parenting, though, I am more aware of its importance in my life and am continually challenged to find it.Dionna ____________________Gentle discipline is the hardest for me, because I was raised in a home where yelling and spanking were acceptable forms of discipline. Before I became a parent, I assumed that I would use similar discipline methods. But once I started reading about how respectful and gentle discipline can have much more positive long-term results, I decided that I wanted something different for my children. Changing this one area for me has not been easy  especially during my sons preschool years! I continue to read and learn, and I try to surround myself by people who share the same values so that I can be motivated and challenged to continue on the path that feels right for our family.<<<< Previous | Continue to Part 7 >>>>FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Im not sure that the article itself is making moms feel bad about their choices. I think it sets up AP moms to look crazy and clingy. Are moms really reading the article and saying I want to be like this frazzled mom! that the author opens the story with?Jamie ____________________I think that a lot of the Mommy Wars go back to the fact that almost every single parent wants the very best for their child. Children are such a gift and people really want to care for their children the best they can. When you choose a different way to parent some mothers become defensive and see it as a personal attack against their choices. No one wants to feel they did something detrimental to their child, so they are going to defend their choice. Also, there are some judgmental moms who do try to push their parenting styles on everyone. That isnt right and creates a rift between parents, especially mothers.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I hope we can get to a point where we encourage all parents to make an educated healthy choice for their children.

Even I feel like a bad mom when I dont reach the expectations I set for myself. No matter how the article was written or portrayed, some mothers will have pangs of regret for things they wish they did differently.Dionna ____________________It seems like mothers can get blamed for everything, doesnt it? Baby not gaining weight fast enough? Must be your milk/method of feeding/something you ate. Preschooler acting out? You must not be spending enough time connecting with him/disciplining him/teaching him manners. Et cetera, et cetera.

What advice do any of you have for moms who feel caught up in the Mommy Wars?Image credit: ODHD on flickrJessica ____________________To me, Mommy Wars is kind of like Valentines Day: a made-up event that guilts us into doing, buying, and believing in things we dont need or want. Weve got to understand that magazines and publishers want their stories and books to sell. Thats their job  to create controversy and excitement to increase interest in their product. Theyre not out to support women in their role as mother. Weve got to do that for each other. I know it sometimes feels hard to stop comparing ourselves to other moms. But, I think it starts there.Jamie ____________________Dont take the bait. Find moms that are encouraging you to make the best choice for your family. That does not mean they will all be parenting the same way as you, but they will respect what you are doing. I personally have more friends that parent conventionally but they love and respect our family and choices.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Melinda ____________________Follow your heart and find what works for you. Everyone should parent the way that they feel comfortable and confident. Take the philosophies that resonate with you and leave the rest:)Dionna ____________________It seems like much of the mommy wars come into play around values or practices that many of us feel passionately about. While I am an advocate for certain things, I try to remember to be compassionate  not judgmental.It helps me to remember that no two families are alike. What works for one family is not going to work in the same way for another family. Were all coming to this parenting gig with different resources, different experiences. The bottom line is, we all love our kids and are trying to do whats best for them.In a post I wrote about compassionate advocacy, I said:Please think before you speak online:Will your message add value to the conversation?Are your words meant to help, or hurt?If your message were the only exposure someone had to your advocacy efforts, what would they take away?<<<< Previous | Continue to Part 9 >>>>FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Dont worry about breastfeeding a three year old. Take it day by day. I never planned to be nursing a three year old. My goal was two years. But, two years came and went and breastfeeding was a great way for my daughter and I to reconnect and handle all those big kid emotions (and mommy meltdowns) that start happening in the toddler years.Jamie ____________________Breastfeeding is normal and natural. Trust your instincts. If both mother and child are happy, then dont listen to outsiders.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Melinda ____________________I always encourage mothers to first of all surround themselves with other breastfeeding mothers even prior to giving birth. I myself was encouraged to attend La Leche League meetings by my birth education teacher and it was amazing. It really helps you set your expectations. When our expectations are compared to formula fed infants it can be overwhelming, when in reality it is much different. Breastfeeding in the beginning can be both easy and really hard. I remind new mothers that as the baby grows, the relationship evolves too, so dont feel trapped by it but rather liberated by it. My message would be the same to mothers of toddlers: be around other mothers who breastfeed their toddlers, follow your heart, and remember it is a relationship.Dionna ____________________Nursing past infancy is part of a healthy, loving relationship. As my friend Lauren of Hobo Mama wrote: You breastfeed day by day, not a years leap at a time. Nursing [my son] today, at 3-years-old, is different from breastfeeding him at 2-years-old by only one day, one moment. He didnt become a gangly toddler overnight, so I had plenty of gradual time to adjust my vision of what a nursling looks like, each day.Just do what feels natural for you and your child.<<<< Previous | Continue to Part 12 >>>>FacebookPinterestTwitter"

How does your partner participate in attachment parenting your child(ren)? iStockphoto.com / Benjamin LooJessica ____________________What started us off with a great foundation was that my husband was able to use all his vacation and sick days at once when our daughter was born. He was home with us for the first month of her life. This was an unbelievable help and not one we expected to have. Hed planned to take two weeks off, but O (our daughter) came a bit early and his schedule was already cleared, so it worked out. This set us both up to be caregiver to O. Feeding was my job. Nurturing me was his job. But so was cuddling, bouncing, diaper changing, and nighttime snuggles with our daughter. It gave us confidence that we could both respond to her needs. And seemed to give our daughter confidence to be soothed by both of us.We talk about what were doing, whats not working, and how we can respond to her needs and each others. Were not perfect and we have our ugly moments, but we are learning. Thats the most important thing for me to remember  we are all learning. Not just our daughter, but we are too. Were learning how to respect one another; how to talk to one another in kindness even we dont feel very kind.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Jamie ____________________My husband is just as close to our boys as I am.

The hardest thing is that the attention mostly has been negative from mainstream media, but that was expected regardless of the angle TIME took. I believe even with a better cover photo and loving tagline bringing mothers together it would have had a poor popular reaction. I am so moved by seeing how most people in the AP community have rallied together to start moving the conversation in the direction they want. Education is happening. People are going to come out of this more enlightened than before. Change isnt going to happen overnight.

We dont need TIME to tell our story  each of us has a voice, each of us can share how AP has worked for our families.The hardest part when talking about the TIME story is getting past that title  I wish TIME would have just presented the AP philosophy without making it seem like a contest.

You Asked. They Answered. TIME’s AP moms take your questions. (Question 16 – The End),http://kellymom.com/blog-post/time-apmoms-interview16/,"Part 16: You Asked. They Answered. TIMEs AP moms take your questions.16. Do you think the TIME article/cover helped or hurt (or both) the effort to educate about AP? Julia Shilova - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________I think a national conversation about AP was a good thing. The coverage probably convinced the critics of their opinion and the AP community of their need to stick together. I think offering an alternative to the way of parenting that is so pervasive is important. I love our AP life  AND it can feel lonely at family gatherings or on the playground when talking about  or talking TO  our kids.Jamie ____________________I had a chance the day after the cover came out to speak to Dr. Sears about my concerns. He said that long-term he had no doubt this would be beneficial to AP. I respect him so much, so I took his positive message to heart. It was hard seeing all the negative reactions from this, but I do see the pendulum swinging the other way. This of course is due to the community I have grown to love so much standing up and giving truths about our lives. I think the cover was negative and complete shock factor journalism which got the world talking. The AP community took that dialogue and is turning it into something beautiful. I didnt do that, my family was definitely taking a stand for something we believed in, but it was the efforts of my fellow APers that created the education currently going on in the world.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Melinda ____________________I think it got the word out there, even though it might have been in a controversial way. It is now a household name and people are learning.Dionna ____________________Both, of course. But we are not TIME. We do not need to let TIME speak for us. We can choose to take the opportunity that TIME gave us  by putting AP and breastfeeding into the national spotlight  and turning it into a positive. Who would you listen to, the author of an article meant to sensationalize a parenting practice? Or a friend who lives it? Be the friend who normalizes it in your community.____________________________I would like to thank everyone  Jessica, Jamie, Melinda, and Dionna  for responding to our questions. The TIME article has raised both awareness and controversy, and it might be some time before the dust settles. We applaud your efforts to advocate for breastfeeding and attachment parenting, and are proud of you for taking the negative publicity and leveraging it into something positive.<<<< PreviousFacebookPinterestTwitter"
You Asked. They Answered. TIME’s AP moms take your questions. (Full Article),http://kellymom.com/blog-post/time-apmoms-interview-full/,"<< Return to index pageFor their May 21 cover story about Dr. Bill Sears and attachment parenting (AP), TIME Magazine took many photographs of four mothers and their children : Jamie Lynne Grumet of Los Angeles, Dionna Ford of Kansas City, Jessica Cary of Brooklyn, and Melinda Larson of Long Island. A photo of Jamie and her son was picked for the cover photo, and all of the moms were interviewed for an online article (though little of the material was actually used). The moms who were photographed asked KellyMom for a chance to bust some of the misconceptions about the TIME article. Since any of these moms could have ended up as the cover model, were thrilled to include all of them in our Q&A session.The magazine article, the headline Are You Mom Enough, and the publicity surrounding the image of Jamie nursing her 3 year old son have sparked an international conversation about both breastfeeding and attachment parenting, with lots of negative press. I was disappointed to see so many people in the press and elsewhere defining AP as something quite different than how most of us see it. After incorrectly defining it, they go on to criticize a straw man version of attachment parenting that doesnt even exist. For instance, I dont know any attachment parent who feels you must co-sleep and wear your baby in a sling from morn till night and breast-feed for years and never, ever let your baby cry.We asked readers of the KellyMom Facebook page what questions they would like to ask these moms. Following are their questions (many are amalgamations of several questions) and the responses from Jessica, Jamie, Melinda, and Dionna.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.First of all, Jamie, what misconceptions about the TIME cover picture featuring you and your son would you like to correct?TIME magazine cover, May 21, 2012 (TIME).Why did I (we) pick that shot for the cover?People assume I had creative control over the cover, which I did not. TIME chose the photo and the headline.Was I paid? Not a penny.Why did I let them pose me like that? I didnt. I have no problem being in a standing position, but the image they captured does not represent the vision and direction of the shoot (which was to convey confidence and contentment). A lot of people dont realize that many photographs are taken while moving around between positions. The picture TIME chose for the cover was one of these outtakes.During the shoot we grabbed a stool and got the shot that is seen in Lightbox (the one that represents better what happened in that room). My son had fallen asleep nursing at my breast in that shot. (The shoot was short but it was his nap time when we got there). The shot is lovely and it was actually this or a very similar photo that was going to be the cover image. The shot TIME eventually chose was confirmed as the cover photo shortly before release.I think the more nurturing shot still would have provoked the same uneducated and ignorant comments we have been hearing. However, a better tagline with a better picture (one that didnt reinforce breastfeeding myths) might have been more embraced by the AP community.1. How did TIME find and choose you?Jessica and family. Used with permission.Jessica ____________________An employee of the photographer TIME hired is a nursing mom who attends a local breastfeeding support group run by one of my friends. This mom reached out to the group, looking for a breastfeeding mom/child (3-5 years old) for a TIME magazine article on evolving parenthood. My friend forwarded that email to a small group of moms with older nurslings and I was on that list. I sent in a few pictures the next morning. Six hours later (Friday afternoon) I heard from an Associate Photo Editor at TIME who said they were interested in us participating in the shoot that was going to happen on Sunday. We were in!Jamie ____________________TIME contacted me by email with their phone number asking if I would be interested in participating in a photo shoot for a story they were doing on attachment parenting. I then found out the story was going to be about Dr. Bill Sears. It sounded like a celebratory story because it was the 20th anniversary of his first book release. The author from TIME spoke about being immersed in the topic, and appeared to have a lot of respect for Dr. Sears.Melinda and family. Used with permission.Melinda ____________________It really was a serendipitous type of a thing. A friend of a friend knew about the photo shoot in NY and thought that they would be interested in our family. I received a call from the photo editor on Friday and was at a photo shoot on Sunday.Dionna ____________________Time contacted me via email. TIMEs photo editor (Neil Harris) had emailed various bloggers in the attachment parenting/natural family living niche. The email specifically asked for families that were big proponents of attachment parenting, had one toddler, and preferably had two or more children. I called to refer several other bloggers I know who volunteer with NaturalParentsNetwork.com; but after Neil and I chatted for awhile, he asked me if my family would like to participate.2. What were you hoping to achieve by being a part of this and do you feel that you were successful in achieving your goals?Jamie and family. Used with permission.Jessica ____________________I thought  how cool that a national magazine wants to show/talk about breastfeeding an older child. I wrote at the time to a friend, that TIME may vilify it in the article, but at least theres a conversation happening in TIME for the masses to be exposed to the idea of breastfeeding beyond infancy. I still think thats true. If my goal was conversation, then yes, I think that has definitely been achieved!Jamie ____________________My hope was to be a catalyst for change in how we view breastfeeding. It seems that we have been moving at a snails pace towards normalizing breastfeeding and this article looked like an opportunity to share a positive message about AP and breastfeeding. We (meaning my husband and I) knew normalizing breastfeeding wouldnt change overnight. However, we needed to take a stand and show there is no shame in parenting our children the way we know is best for our family.I believe the cover alone did not achieve this goal. However, it has made the topic very public and I do believe the AP and breastfeeding communities have really stepped up to have difficult conversations with people about their misconceptions. It has been a community effort, and the brunt of the work has been undertaken by people who did not ask for it. I feel such a sense of community among mothers and fathers stepping up to say no to judgement among any healthy parenting style, and helping educate people about AP and breastfeeding.Dionna and family. Used with permission.Melinda ____________________We were excited to be a part of a article that we were told was introducing Dr. Sears and Attachment Parenting to the world. The way that TIME wrote the article may not have been as positive as I was led to believe, but the message has been getting out. Amongst the mountain of criticism arose a very strong, confident steadfast response in the Attachment Parenting community, thanks to Jamie, Dr. Sears, API, Mayim and others. People are learning about it, paying attention and through that those who resonate with those philosophies can find support.Dionna ____________________I am passionate about normalizing breastfeeding  in public, past infancy, etc. I celebrate every woman who attempts to breastfeed, for three days or three years. I believe that one reason people in Western society are still so uncomfortable seeing women breastfeeding is because we do not see it enough. Our culture places much more emphasis on the sexual aspect of the breast, so much so that many people are uneasy seeing or discussing the primary, biological purpose of the breast  to nourish our children. By participating in this photo shoot, I hoped to be one more voice encouraging women, normalizing breastfeeding, sending out a message that nurturing your children in this way is normal, natural, and healthy. While I do not feel that the article had this message at all, I do think that there have been opportunities for education and conversation that would not have happened otherwise.3. What messages about attachment parenting and/or breastfeeding were you hoping TIME would convey in their article? iStockphoto.com / Ksenia KozlovskayaJessica ____________________In my first conversation with TIME the photo editor explained that the article would be a profile of Dr. Sears and Attachment Parenting. My husband and I are attachment parenting, so I thought it was a perfect fit. From the little exposure I have to magazine/news coverage (I am a freelance writer), I went in without any expectations of what TIME would convey. I hoped it would be informative. I hoped it would paint AP as a back-to-basics type of childrearing. I hoped that it would be a counterpoint to the recent tough love / its not neglect if youre speaking french parenting books that have hit the parenting scene of late. I hoped that their profile of Dr. Sears would be balanced. I hoped that they wouldnt vilify breastfeeding older kids.Before I got to read the article, I watched a video of the articles author, Kate Pickert, online. From that two minute clip, I knew it wasnt going to be a balanced piece. How she described AP was misinformed and the language she used was sensationalistic.Jamie ____________________My family was hoping this would be an outlet to show attachment parenting is a valid and normal parenting decision. There should be no shame in parenting your child this way.Melinda ____________________I was hoping that it would introduce attachment parenting, how it has grown and the community that it has created and leave it up to the individual to decide whether they wanted to support it or not.Dionna ____________________According to one survey, less than 10% of women nurse their children past 18 months. Because I write about breastfeeding past infancy on CodeNameMama.com, I get emails from women quite often who say thank you for letting me know it is ok and that Im not alone! I had hoped that the author of the article would write about how natural and healthy ecological breastfeeding is for both mother and child. While the cover story did not convey that message, I was happy to see that one of the side stories did work (somewhat) to normalize nursing past infancy.4. What kind of reaction to the article were you expecting? How has reality compared to what you thought you could expect? drubig-photo - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________All of the attention was completely unexpected. I am just doing what has come naturally to me and my daughter. I breastfeed her. The fact that it was causing such an uproar was crazy. Or that a news van was parked outside our house all day until I came home with my little one (passed out in the stroller). It felt bizarre. I couldnt believe that breastfeeding my daughter was this much news.Jamie ____________________My family was prepared for backlash if our photo made it into the article or onto the cover. We felt this way even when we had the hope that TIME would select a more nurturing photo. People in our society are uncomfortable with the idea that breasts are biologically designed to breastfeed offspring. This is even more true past the first year.The reaction to the article has been lackluster. However, the reaction to the cover has definitely been polarizing. I believe the tagline was the main reason for this. The reaction to Mom Enough caused an uproar and was viewed as pitting moms against each other. TIME using this article to play into the mommy wars was not one of the potential risks my husband and I addressed prior to the shoot.The reaction to me personally? I was expecting curiosity, but not as much personal attention as it seems we have ended up receiving. It was a risk we were willing to take in the hopes of doing something positive to normalize breastfeeding.Melinda ____________________I was expecting criticism, but proud to represent something that my husband and I truly believe in. For almost 7 years we have chosen to parent in a way that is different from our families and friends choices so we are used to the criticism. They way that the article was represented may have sparked a little more criticism than we imagined, but it is starting conversations about how we parent which will in turn eventually get the more positive message out there.Dionna ____________________We had no idea that the author was taking the particular slant she did with the article. In fact before agreeing to participate, I checked and double-checked with Neil Harris of TIME that attachment parenting and the families at the photo shoot would not be portrayed in a negative light. My husband and I never expected the reaction  but we would have never guessed that TIME was hoping to spin the feature as fuel for the mommy wars. Im incredibly disappointed in TIMEs choice to cast AP in terms of being mom enough.5. How do you feel about AP being portrayed as extreme? (TIME is not the only media outlet to do this)Image credit: Pullara on flickrJessica ____________________Its unfortunate. And I also understand why it can look this way. Our culture focuses on independence of babies from the moment they exit the womb. AP, to me, honors the way parenting children has been done over time, around the world  which is to keep babies close, respond to them, breastfeed them when theyre hungry. This seems to go against every fiber of our American way of being which wants mom to regain her sense of identity right away, have the baby get used to being on her own at three weeks or sleep down the hall (and through the night) so mom and dad can have time to themselves as soon as possible.Jamie ____________________That always bothers me. There is nothing extreme about the way we parent. I find it relaxed and natural.Melinda ____________________Attachment Parenting, to some, does feel extreme because it is so selfless. Those who might label it that way could be afraid of it because it does take inner faith to trust your instincts rather than follow the crowd. No matter what you call it, those of us who have embraced attachment parenting did not do so because Dr. Sears told us to, we did it because our heart led us there. So no matter what label the media wants to give it, to us it is just parenting.Dionna ____________________Talking about attachment parenting as extreme is almost laughable for us. We think that most of what we do is easy.Breastfeeding? Easy! (after we got through the initial struggles)Cosleeping? Restful!Having baby in a carrier? Convenient!Treating my child gently and with respect? An investment in having a respectful child in the future!The media loves to paint things as extreme  its what gets the headlines. Those of us who identify as AP parents are doing much more to educate people about the realities of what life can be like. We just need to take the opportunity TIME has given us and turn it into something positive.6. What area(s) of AP have you struggled with and how were you able to resolve your issue(s)?Dionna and baby. Used with permission.Jessica ____________________I wish that I had realized that balance was as key to a happy, healthy family as was responding with sensitivity. Im at home with my daughter. On the weekends, I love spending time with both her and my husband and when she was younger, I didnt want to leave and have time for myself. But, then, come Monday, I was exhausted and frazzled and really felt the need for time alone. Now, I make sure to make time  for meditation, for yoga, for taking myself out to lunch.When my daughter was a baby, it felt easy to respond to her with sensitivity. Now that shes almost three, it can be challenging in the face of emotional upsets and tantrums. Whats helped us is to focus on prevention  dont take her to the grocery store too close to nap time, etc. And its also been REALLY essential to me to have AP-minded folks in our life. My closest mommy friend (we met in our childbirth class) happens to practice AP and its been wonderful to have someone to support me, talk to, encourage, trade ideas, and challenge my old patterns along the way. Ive also connected to our local API support group that has a vibrant yahoo group and monthly meetings.Jamie ____________________Dr. Sears talks about birth bonding, which I was not able to do. I had HELLP Syndrome with my pregnancy and my son was delivered 2 months premature. We were all so grateful he was born healthy at his gestational age. However, I was very sick (even after delivery) and I was not able to see him for three days. My husband, mom, dad, and sister-in-law (who is a pediatrician) took charge. My sister-in-law took a photo of my son in the NICU and brought it to me to help stimulate my milk. My husband would bring me the pump every two hours. If I was sleeping he took it upon himself to attach the pump for me so I could sleep through the pumping session. My parents and sister were my cheerleaders. They were so positive about being able to breastfeed and bond, but also were so great about understanding formula potentially could be an option, and there was no shame in using it if we needed it. We ended up not needing to use formula, but I think the encouragement from my family and knowing that no matter what, my son would be nourished, was what helped our breastfeeding story be successful.Melinda ____________________Attachment parenting is a constant growing and learning experience for everyone involved because it is a relationship. Being present and balancing has always been my struggle and as a parent continues to be. Through attachment parenting, though, I am more aware of its importance in my life and am continually challenged to find it.Dionna ____________________Gentle discipline is the hardest for me, because I was raised in a home where yelling and spanking were acceptable forms of discipline. Before I became a parent, I assumed that I would use similar discipline methods. But once I started reading about how respectful and gentle discipline can have much more positive long-term results, I decided that I wanted something different for my children. Changing this one area for me has not been easy  especially during my sons preschool years! I continue to read and learn, and I try to surround myself by people who share the same values so that I can be motivated and challenged to continue on the path that feels right for our family.7. Why do you think so many women think this article is calling them a bad mom?Jamie tandem nursing her sons. Used with permission.Jessica ____________________The title sets it up for sure. It draws moms in and has them already be on guard for what theyre about to read. Im not sure that the article itself is making moms feel bad about their choices. I think it sets up AP moms to look crazy and clingy. Are moms really reading the article and saying I want to be like this frazzled mom! that the author opens the story with?Jamie ____________________I think that a lot of the Mommy Wars go back to the fact that almost every single parent wants the very best for their child. Children are such a gift and people really want to care for their children the best they can. When you choose a different way to parent some mothers become defensive and see it as a personal attack against their choices. No one wants to feel they did something detrimental to their child, so they are going to defend their choice. Also, there are some judgmental moms who do try to push their parenting styles on everyone. That isnt right and creates a rift between parents, especially mothers.I hope we can get to a point where we encourage all parents to make an educated healthy choice for their children. That does not mean all the choices will be the same. Families are different and children are different. There is not one-size-fits all in parenting.Melinda ____________________No one can call you a bad mom but yourself, but we all do it. Even I feel like a bad mom when I dont reach the expectations I set for myself. No matter how the article was written or portrayed, some mothers will have pangs of regret for things they wish they did differently.Dionna ____________________It seems like mothers can get blamed for everything, doesnt it? Baby not gaining weight fast enough? Must be your milk/method of feeding/something you ate. Preschooler acting out? You must not be spending enough time connecting with him/disciplining him/teaching him manners. Et cetera, et cetera. So of course when the title asks if youre mom enough, the connotation is that youre not if youre not doing X, Y, and Z.Do I believe that? No.8. What advice do any of you have for moms who feel caught up in the Mommy Wars?Image credit: ODHD on flickrJessica ____________________To me, Mommy Wars is kind of like Valentines Day: a made-up event that guilts us into doing, buying, and believing in things we dont need or want. Weve got to understand that magazines and publishers want their stories and books to sell. Thats their job  to create controversy and excitement to increase interest in their product. Theyre not out to support women in their role as mother. Weve got to do that for each other. I know it sometimes feels hard to stop comparing ourselves to other moms. But, I think it starts there.Jamie ____________________Dont take the bait. Find moms that are encouraging you to make the best choice for your family. That does not mean they will all be parenting the same way as you, but they will respect what you are doing. I personally have more friends that parent conventionally but they love and respect our family and choices.Melinda ____________________Follow your heart and find what works for you. Everyone should parent the way that they feel comfortable and confident. Take the philosophies that resonate with you and leave the rest:)Dionna ____________________It seems like much of the mommy wars come into play around values or practices that many of us feel passionately about. While I am an advocate for certain things, I try to remember to be compassionate  not judgmental.It helps me to remember that no two families are alike. What works for one family is not going to work in the same way for another family. Were all coming to this parenting gig with different resources, different experiences. The bottom line is, we all love our kids and are trying to do whats best for them.In a post I wrote about compassionate advocacy, I said:Please think before you speak online:Will your message add value to the conversation?Are your words meant to help, or hurt?If your message were the only exposure someone had to your advocacy efforts, what would they take away?9. How did you feel about the way extended breastfeeding was portrayed on the cover of TIME? Igor Yaruta - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________It didnt portray breastfeeding the way it naturally occurs  in a nurturing, snuggly way. Though, I certainly have seen older kids standing up nursing while their moms are busy talking to me or others around her. As far as how it was publicly portrayed before  was it?!One of the producers at ABCs Nightline said to me during my interview, I dont think the uproar would have happened if the mom had been breastfeeding a six month old. My response: Maybe. But I cant recall ever seeing a mom nursing a child of ANY age on the cover of a national magazine. We see breasts on lots of other magazine covers, mainly to sell products. We never get to see breasts as what they are  mammary glands that nourish our babies.Jamie ____________________Awkward is the only term that really expresses that picture for me. I was there, so I know what they were going for (confidence and contentment), and it was not conveyed in that picture. I am not thrilled with the shot of me, but my biggest problem is with my son and his body language in the photo. I see his expression and arm placement as completely disconnected, which made the photo a poor representation of what breastfeeding really is past infancy (connectedness, comfort, and lovenot to mention the antibodies and nutrients they are getting in the breast milk).I have no problem nursing standing up (we have definitely done it at homein fact, we did it today!)  I thought that standing would help show how infant breastfeeding is different than toddler breastfeeding (the majority of people seem not to understand that). What they were looking for is playfulness, confidence, contentment, and always nurturing in the pose. Do you see that in this photo? I dont. They definitely have those shots and I feel they lost an opportunity to educate by choosing an outtake rather than one of the pictures we worked so hard to get.Melinda ____________________I personally would have chosen a different headline and picture to represent extended breastfeeding because of what it means to me, but no matter how loving you make it those who disagree will disagree.Dionna ____________________During the photo shoot, Martin Schoeller (the photographer for TIME) asked us to look confident, assured. The photos he had up as inspiration were all very maternal in appearance. I do feel that Jamie looked confident and assured in her picture, but the pose was not one that I felt anyone looked for during the entire shoot.Regardless of the pose itself, I am glad that breastfeeding an older child was shown on the cover. Breastfeeding past infancy is normal, natural, and healthy, whether your child is three weeks old or three years old.10. How would you respond to people who believe that your child(ren) will be negatively impacted by the current conversation or face bullying in the future related to their presence in the photos showing breastfeeding? iStockphoto.com / Alison Trotta-MarshallJessica ____________________Im not sure why, but this question really pushes my buttons. I dont see how my child would be negatively impacted by the conversation thats happening. My child is growing up in a nurturing environment with parents that love her, feeding her according to her biological needs. And whos going to be bullying my child? Her peers wont even know about this debate unless their parents make it a big deal and encourage an atmosphere of intolerance. I think this question is a passive-aggressive way of putting down the mom  Im just worried about the children! Really? As my childs mother, do you believe Im NOT worried about my child in every way?Jamie ____________________My mom was a breastfeeding advocate and there are pictures of me breastfeeding everywhere. People said the same thing to her, but she didnt listen to them. I am proud of her for standing up for what she believes in. Her efforts were an attempt to help normalize breastfeeding for my generation.As a mother, Im here to teach my children right from wrong and help guide them into being strong, loved adults  not make life easy. Life is anything but easy, and a strong foundation of knowing who you are and what you believe in will make you life BETTER Not easier.I find it amazing how we have such a bullying problem in our country, yet we are empowering every current and future bully by making decisions based on potential future reactions.Jessica and daughter. Used with permission.Melinda ____________________Children are negatively impacted and bullied every day, whether they graced the cover of TIME or not. Bullies are themselves in need of love and acceptance and I have no doubt that the children that these women are currently nurturing are caring and confident enough to recognize that and feel compassion for those who criticize.Dionna ____________________I am fortunate to be a member of a local community where it is very common for mothers to nurse into toddlerhood and beyond. I know many children who were breastfed until they were 4, 5, or 6 years old, and I know children who know children who nursed that long. Weve had conversations since this cover came out, and for these children, this is no big deal. And thats what were trying to do! We want to help make this no big deal for the children who are growing up today! Coincidentally, my sister is in Ecuador right now, and shes had conversations about this with several of the people there. They are all very surprised  all this over breastfeeding a three year old? theyve asked. Id love that surprise to be shared by members of our culture in ten years.In a different vein, kids make fun of other kids for so many different things: the clothes they wear, the neighborhood they live in, the religion their family practices. Would you move so that your child would not face taunts about the house you lived in? Would you expect someone to change religions so that their child could belong to the dominant cultural religion?11. What would you say to a new mother to help normalize sustained breastfeeding for her and possibly help her envision that for herself and her family? How would your message change for a mother who is coming up on a year of breastfeeding?Image credit: Mothering Touch on flickrJessica ____________________I would say to moms with kids of all ages  do what is working for you and your child. Dont worry about breastfeeding a three year old. Take it day by day. I never planned to be nursing a three year old. My goal was two years. But, two years came and went and breastfeeding was a great way for my daughter and I to reconnect and handle all those big kid emotions (and mommy meltdowns) that start happening in the toddler years.Jamie ____________________Breastfeeding is normal and natural. Trust your instincts. If both mother and child are happy, then dont listen to outsiders.Melinda ____________________I always encourage mothers to first of all surround themselves with other breastfeeding mothers even prior to giving birth. I myself was encouraged to attend La Leche League meetings by my birth education teacher and it was amazing. It really helps you set your expectations. When our expectations are compared to formula fed infants it can be overwhelming, when in reality it is much different. Breastfeeding in the beginning can be both easy and really hard. I remind new mothers that as the baby grows, the relationship evolves too, so dont feel trapped by it but rather liberated by it. My message would be the same to mothers of toddlers: be around other mothers who breastfeed their toddlers, follow your heart, and remember it is a relationship.Dionna ____________________Nursing past infancy is part of a healthy, loving relationship. As my friend Lauren of Hobo Mama wrote: You breastfeed day by day, not a years leap at a time. Nursing [my son] today, at 3-years-old, is different from breastfeeding him at 2-years-old by only one day, one moment. He didnt become a gangly toddler overnight, so I had plenty of gradual time to adjust my vision of what a nursling looks like, each day.Just do what feels natural for you and your child.12. How does your partner participate in attachment parenting your child(ren)? iStockphoto.com / Benjamin LooJessica ____________________What started us off with a great foundation was that my husband was able to use all his vacation and sick days at once when our daughter was born. He was home with us for the first month of her life. This was an unbelievable help and not one we expected to have. Hed planned to take two weeks off, but O (our daughter) came a bit early and his schedule was already cleared, so it worked out. This set us both up to be caregiver to O. Feeding was my job. Nurturing me was his job. But so was cuddling, bouncing, diaper changing, and nighttime snuggles with our daughter. It gave us confidence that we could both respond to her needs. And seemed to give our daughter confidence to be soothed by both of us.We talk about what were doing, whats not working, and how we can respond to her needs and each others. Were not perfect and we have our ugly moments, but we are learning. Thats the most important thing for me to remember  we are all learning. Not just our daughter, but we are too. Were learning how to respect one another; how to talk to one another in kindness even we dont feel very kind.Jamie ____________________My husband is just as close to our boys as I am. He participates in every part of parenting aside from breastfeeding, but he made up for that with a lot of cuddling. I did/do the breastfeeding and he does the roughhousing. Otherwise, our parenting styles are identical.Image credit: Mothering Touch on flickrSome examples:Cooking with the kidsDevotionalsTaking the kids to the park/museums/aquariums etc.Play gamesWhen he is home from work he will participate as a teacher during homeschoolingBathingDressingCuddlingFeedingTaking the kids to martial arts classBedtime StoriesJust loving them and being presentAbove barely scrapes the surface of how my husband is an equal and happy participant in attachment parenting.Melinda ____________________My partner is my rock and my #1 support. I cant do what I do without him. Our parenting style has really made us stronger as a couple and as parents.Dionna ____________________My husband is a wonderful partner. His role has changed through the years depending on my needs and the needs of our children. Hes done everything from all of the nighttime diaper changes, to doing the bulk of the housework when I feel overwhelmed and cannot help, to bouncing babies to sleep, to helping the preschooler navigate a changing world.My partner is as much of an attachment parent as I am, it just looks a little different.13. Do you believe that attachment parenting could cause America to take a step backward in the fight for womens rights? Lev Dolgatsjov - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________I am a feminist. I have identified with that label since 8th grade (when I discovered Sassy magazine!). I dont believe that attachment parenting and feminism are at odds with one another. I think our culture does not value the work of mothers. Only in a culture that values money, prestige and working outside the home as the source of female empowerment could motherhood be viewed as being anti-feminist. Whats anti-WOMAN are our countrys lack of financial support for new mothers (among a whole other host of things).Jamie ____________________Not at all. Quite the opposite. We need to work towards better leave for mothers and fathers when a child is introduced into the family. The United States can do much better than they are in encouraging both parents  helping uplift them during such a life changing event as a new child.Melinda ____________________Just because I choose to stay at home and raise my family does not mean I am giving up my rights. Just because more women are choosing to, does not mean that they are giving up their rights. We are working women! It is a choice that I hope will lose its stigma of being anti-feminist.Dionna ____________________I do not believe that mothers or fathers need to stay at home 24/7 to be attached parents. Working on building healthy attachments with our children can help any parent establish loving, secure relationships  regardless of whether they work inside or outside the home.On a related note, I do wish our country had more generous maternity and paternity leave laws, and I hope that the science behind attachment parenting can provide the impetus to affect change.14. What has been the best thing to come out of the TIME story about Dr. Sears? What has been the hardest thing?Image credit: matsber on flickrJessica ____________________Im having so many interesting conversations with people in all walks of my life  my 80 year old childless landlord, my friends, my family. Perfect strangers are chatting about it at the playground. Thats exciting to me!Jamie ____________________It really did get people talking. When have we ever had this big of a platform to talk about attachment parenting? My mom cant even remember. The hardest thing is that the attention mostly has been negative from mainstream media, but that was expected regardless of the angle TIME took. I believe even with a better cover photo and loving tagline bringing mothers together it would have had a poor popular reaction. I am so moved by seeing how most people in the AP community have rallied together to start moving the conversation in the direction they want. Education is happening. People are going to come out of this more enlightened than before. Change isnt going to happen overnight. I think at the end of the day the cover was one step backwards, but it opened the door for others to help take ten steps forward normalizing AP and breastfeeding.Melinda ____________________The best thing about the story is that people are talking about it and people who were looking have found support. The hardest thing is the controversial way we had to get there. Then again, no matter how you present the topic, it is controversial and making it extreme was a way to really get people talking about it.Dionna ____________________The TIME cover has started more conversations about AP and breastfeeding past infancy than there would have been without it. We dont need TIME to tell our story  each of us has a voice, each of us can share how AP has worked for our families.The hardest part when talking about the TIME story is getting past that title  I wish TIME would have just presented the AP philosophy without making it seem like a contest. It created divisiveness.15. What advice would you share with a friend if they came to you and were considering becoming involved with a major media outlet for a story related to breastfeeding or attachment parenting? Blend Images - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________Know that you are not in control of how a story is spun. Show up, be yourself and talk about what is important. Dont take the bait on provocative questions. And pray they edit it graciously.Jamie ____________________I would say beware. There is always risk assessment you have to do when having a major publication like this use your image (even if you feel everything is going in the direction you approve of). There are no guarantees; even when the risk that the final product will not look like what you envision is considerably low. Dr. Sears and our four families all took a risk and it didnt work out the way we would have preferred. Just know that the outcome potentially may not be in your favor, but dont let that stop you from making an educated decision to participate in something that will help a positive message come out.Melinda ____________________If it feels right, go for it. If I had anytime felt uncomfortable I would have declined. My family comes first.Dionna ____________________Im not sure that any two experiences would be the same, but I would advise talking to the author/reporter about the tenor of the piece. My husband and I spent a lot of time talking about potential negative consequences  to our family, our child. We decided that the opportunity to normalize breastfeeding outweighed the potential negatives.16. Do you think the TIME article/cover helped or hurt (or both) the effort to educate about AP? Julia Shilova - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________I think a national conversation about AP was a good thing. The coverage probably convinced the critics of their opinion and the AP community of their need to stick together. I think offering an alternative to the way of parenting that is so pervasive is important. I love our AP life  AND it can feel lonely at family gatherings or on the playground when talking about  or talking TO  our kids.Jamie ____________________I had a chance the day after the cover came out to speak to Dr. Sears about my concerns. He said that long-term he had no doubt this would be beneficial to AP. I respect him so much, so I took his positive message to heart. It was hard seeing all the negative reactions from this, but I do see the pendulum swinging the other way. This of course is due to the community I have grown to love so much standing up and giving truths about our lives. I think the cover was negative and complete shock factor journalism which got the world talking. The AP community took that dialogue and is turning it into something beautiful. I didnt do that, my family was definitely taking a stand for something we believed in, but it was the efforts of my fellow APers that created the education currently going on in the world.Melinda ____________________I think it got the word out there, even though it might have been in a controversial way. It is now a household name and people are learning.Dionna ____________________Both, of course. But we are not TIME. We do not need to let TIME speak for us. We can choose to take the opportunity that TIME gave us  by putting AP and breastfeeding into the national spotlight  and turning it into a positive. Who would you listen to, the author of an article meant to sensationalize a parenting practice? Or a friend who lives it? Be the friend who normalizes it in your community.____________________________I would like to thank everyone  Jessica, Jamie, Melinda, and Dionna  for responding to our questions. The TIME article has raised both awareness and controversy, and it might be some time before the dust settles. We applaud your efforts to advocate for breastfeeding and attachment parenting, and are proud of you for taking the negative publicity and leveraging it into something positive.<< Return to index pageFacebookPinterestTwitter"

Mother-2-Mother Concerns: Baby’s Sleep,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/m2m-baby-sleep/,"Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.When, where and how baby sleeps is a hot topic. Everyone has an opinion as to what is best for mother and baby. It is important to remember when considering these issues that what is important is important only as it relates to *you*  in other words, what is important to some, is not important to others, and its really nobodys business how (or where or when) you and baby sleep! Crying it out isnt an option for many parents and luckily, it doesnt *have* to be. There are many options to the cry it out method which are not as harsh and which provide parents and babies with loving, gentler solutions to getting more sleep.Most breastfeeding experts encourage mother to co-sleep with her infant. Some frown on co-sleeping, but experts like Dr. Williams Sears, father of 8 breastfed children, put it simply, indicating that the best investment new parents can make, is a bigger bed, and supports co-sleeping. He offers wonderful information on sleep concerns that can really help a parent understand how a baby sleeps as well as ideas to help reduce or eliminate sleep problems.Dr. Jay Gordon, pediatrician says Dont let anyone convince you that this is a harmful choice or that there will be no way to get him out of your bed if you dont do it now. Dont believe anyone who says that babies who cuddle and nurse all night long never learn to self soothe or become independent. This is simply not true but it sells books and the myths stay in our culture. Dr. James McKenna, PhD, Director of the Mother-Baby Behavioral Sleep Lab at the University of Notre Dame, says,  By sleeping next to its mother, the infant receives protection, warmth, emotional reassurance, and breastmilk  in just the forms and quantities that nature intended.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Nursing to sleep and sleeping all night are also hot topics. There are many out there that would have a mother believe she is creating problems for herself and her baby by doing what comes naturally  hopefully the information here and the links to additional info, will assure the mother that her choice to co-sleep, to nurse baby to sleep, and/or to comfort nurse baby are all choices that are supported and encouraged by experts and many, many parents.Related Items from the KellyMom Store:The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Newborns: Amazing Sleep from Day One  For Baby and YouSweet Sleep: Nighttime and Naptime Strategies for the Breastfeeding FamilyFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Sleepy Babies,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/sleepy-babies/,"Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.If your baby is sleepy here are some suggestions to help keep the baby awake and interested:make sure your free hand is supporting your breast so the weight of the breast isnt on the babys chinswitch breasts as soon as the baby begins to lose interest in active nursing, this *may* need to be done every 30 to 60 seconds at first (the first few times you do it). You should begin to see a difference within a couple days of doing this.Burp and change diaper. Burping should be done with the baby sitting supported upright on moms knee or lap rather than over the shoulder because its also less sleep-inducing.nurse in clutch or football hold as opposed to cradle hold  its a little less cuddly and sleep-inducing.massage the babys head (crown) in a circular motion while nursing. Also using a wet cold washcloth and wiping back against the grain of the hair growth can help Try this for several days and see if theres improvement, and please update us as you can.Place baby on your lap with legs near your tummy and head on your knees. Gently supporting baby, raise in sitting position, like doing a sit- up. Do this two or three times, then do side to side a couple times.You can also try breast compressions.You may want to reduce any outside or excessive stimulation (bright lights, noise, etc.). Sometimes babies just need to tune out all the noise/light and they do this by falling asleep.Active SuckingIf you are having problems with the baby not actively sucking, you can try breast compressions, or try the following tips offered by Kathy Kuhn RN BSN IBCLC:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Allow the baby to take normal pauses in his suck pattern up to about 15 seconds. If the pause lasts longer encourage him to suck again by:Taking a deep breathsometimes just that movement of your chest makes the baby suck again.If that doesnt work trymassaging your breasttake your whole hand and squeeze near the chest wall (GENTLY) then squeeze midway between the chest wall and areola then squeeze near to the areola and then repeat the sequence. Stop massaging as soon as the baby sucks.If that doesnt work try:stroking under the babys chin from chin to Adams apple with medium pressure.If you have tried all three and the baby is not suckling take the baby off the breast. If it has been less than about 10 minutes per breast of active suck then you should probably supplement after that feeding unless all other feedings have been super.Additional tips:Waking a sleepy baby at AskDrSears.comWaking A Sleepy Baby by Anne Smith, IBCLCFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Exclusive Pumping,http://kellymom.com/mother2mother/exclusive-pumping/,"(aka: everything you wanted to know about exclusive pumping but didnt know who to ask!) Reprinted from Mother-2-Mother.com (2000-2006), with permission from the author, Paula Y.How Often & When?How Long to Pump?How Much Milk Per Bottle?How to Bottle-feed the Breastfed BabyIncreasing SupplyPumping Tricks: More Tips for Eping Moms by Eping MomsSpecial ThanksA note about exclusive pumping:There are occasions that arise which may prevent a mom from being able to nurse her baby. A mother who has a baby who cannot or will not latch, for whatever reason, may assume there is no choice but for her to use infant formula. There is another option however, and one that doesnt seem to get the support or acknowledgment it deserves  exclusively pumping, also known as EPing.In most cases, a mother who has made the decision to exclusively pump has not done so lightly. She is aware of the irreplaceable benefits of her milk, and she wants her baby to have the best, so the most logical conclusion for her is to pump and provide her milk to baby by bottle.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Sadly, many (including health care providers) will tell mom that this is crazy idea, and itll never work; youll run out of milk; or will say you simply will not be able to keep up. Without the support and information she needs, a mom may simply give up.Those who dont give up often are faced with other issues to overcome. They often feel like they are in a class by themselves, excluded from the usual groups of moms who typically form into support groups either for breastfeeding mothers, or for formula feeding mothers.They may feel they must explain why they are bottle feeding breastmilk  even to their health care providers who often ask.. breast or bottle assuming bottle is formula.While everyone does agree that there are irreplaceable benefits to nursing baby directly from breast, everyone also must agree that breastmilk itself is irreplaceable. When faced with providing breastmilk, or not, then whenever possible it should be breastmilk regardless of the method of delivery.There is no room or need for guilt here  the mother who has done all she can to bf normally isnt a failure  she is just doing the best she can in the situation she is in. Mothers who choose to exclusively pump are very dedicated mothers  determined to do the best they can for their precious babies, and they deserve respect and support.Here are some tips and information regarding exclusive pumping:All About Exclusive Pumping and Tips for EPing Moms by EPing Moms:The Best Expressed!(italicized info shared by Shanna)HOW OFTEN TO PUMP & WHEN?:First and foremost  one should have a good quality, double electric pump. Some mothers rent them, others buy pumps such as the Hygeia EnJoye. The quality of the pump can make all the difference in the world!A normal newborn baby nurses on average 8 to 12 times in a 24 hour period. Most experts suggest it is best if mom can come close to matching what the normal nursing baby would do at the breast, and recommend she pump about every two hours, not going longer than three hours between sessions. Understanding how milk production works can help moms in their efforts to establish good milk supply. The more frequently the breasts are emptied, the more milk mother should have. Therefore, if she were to pump at least every 3 hours, for about 20 minutes, she should establish and maintain a good milk supply. In the first couple of weeks, she may also want to pump at least twice at night, but not all mothers do this.Its insanely hard in the beginning but you need to pump every 2 to 3 hours around the clock. Prolactin levels (the hormone that tells your body to make milk) are highest in the early morning hours so mom would want to make sure she is pumping then as well. This is like the 1am to 5am stretch of time. If mom can at least get one pump in during this time, it will really help. The main concern is to get enough pumps in per day  a minimum of 7 pumps per day. I will say from experience that when I pushed myself to get in 8 pumps per day, my supply REALLY increased. Most of the time, I just couldnt push myself and ended up with 7 times. And to create a little bit of sanity, it is the number of pumps per day that you get in and not necessarily the amount of time you wait in between pumps that counts. So, if I needed to run an errand or just wanted to get out of the house without dragging my pump along, I would pump every 2 hours in the morning and then have a window of about 4 or 5 hours in the afternoon to do everything and would then pump again every 2 hours in the evening to get my total of 7 pumps in for the day. That being said, I did NOT get up to pump in the middle of the night if my baby wasnt awake. I thought that was cruel and couldnt do it! Ha! The sleep was more important to me (especially after the c-section). A lot of pumping is trial and error and this is why keeping info in a spreadsheet (or journal) is helpful. If you start sleeping through the night or going longer stretches and see a huge decline in your volume, you can always set you alarm to add another pump back in. I never had to but this can vary from mom to mom. I did the early morning pump as long as I was up feeding the baby, but if she slept 5 hours through the night, so did I!  PUMPING  HOW LONG?Most experts agree that whatever the reason for pumping, moms should pump for about 20 minutes. Most agree its best to pump at least 15 minutes, and to avoid going much longer than 20 minutes. Experts also encourage pumping about five minutes past when the milk stops flowing, often by doing so mom will elicit another letdown, and at the very least will maintain production as well as encouraging increase in supply if needed.The standard advice is to pump for 15-20 minutes. Even if you dont have milk flowing that entire time, you need to pump that long to get enough nipple stimulation. Also pumping at least 5 minutes after your milk stops flowing will tell your body that you need more milk; thus increasing your supply. 15 minutes should absolutely be the minimum pumping time. Ive talked to women who only pumped for 10 minutes and eventually started losing their supply. They had to work really hard to rebuild it.Pump SettingsMore is not better when it comes to the suction settings on the breast pump. Most experienced moms do not set the pump speed on high, but rather keep it on lower setting for comfort.This one was a BIGGIE for me and I want to definitely pass this one on! There should be a suction setting on your pump and a speed dial. This is very important, the higher the suction does NOT mean the more milk you make. Your pump will probably have a suction setting of minimum, medium, and maximum. I had mine set on medium when I developed a blister. Once it healed, I turned it down to minimum and have never had another blister or pain again. I keep the speed at 3 but if you feel like too much areola is being sucked into the horn, then turning down the speed will remedy that. If you are in a lot of pain and turn down the settings, you might actually get more milk because you are more relaxed! HOW MUCH MILK PER BOTTLE?Moms may find it surprising that the breastfed baby often takes less milk in the bottle than formula babies take in. This is because breastmilk is so well utilized by the babys body that less is needed. Since breastmilk is so easily and completely digested, the breastfed baby needs to eat more often, but they dont need as much per bottle.When a baby is nursed from the breast, research shows us that baby will vary their intake of milk from feeding to feeding, and the length of time at the breast doesnt always correlate with the amount of milk taken from the breast. Overall, the average bf baby takes in between 19 and 30 oz (or 570  900 mL) per day (24 hrs), but the amount taken per bottle may vary somewhat from feeding to feeding, just as it does at the breast, depending on babys need at the time. According to the most current breastfeeding research, exclusively breastfed babies take in an average of 25 oz (750 mL) per day between the ages of 1 month and 6 months. This may vary a little from baby to baby, but the average range of milk intake is 19-30 oz per day (570-900 mL per day).To estimate the average amount of milk baby will need at a feeding: Estimate the number of times that baby nurses per day (24 hours).Then divide 25 oz by the number of nursings.This gives you a ballpark figure for the amount of expressed milk your exclusively breastfed baby will need at one feeding.Example: If baby usually nurses around 8 times per day, you can guess that baby might need around 3 ounces per feeding every 3 hours when mom is away. (25/8=3.1).NOTE: Current breastfeeding research does not indicate that breastmilk intake changes with babys age or weight between one and six months.You can find a quick and easy expressed breastmilk calculator here.HOW TO BOTTLEFEEDIt is important to remember that it is very easy to overfeed a baby using bottles. This is because the way a baby drinks from a bottle is very different than how a baby would nurse from the breast. A baby cannot control the flow of milk from a bottle thus experts recommend using slow flow or newborn type nipples, to reduce the risk of overfeeding.The breastmilk should never be warmed in the microwave, since doing so not only creates hot spots that cannot fully be distributed evenly even when the milk is mixed (the heat adheres to the fats which glob together, and can result in scalding of a babys mouth and throat), but it actually alters the composition of the breastmilk, damaging some of the nutrients. Shaking breastmilk is also not recommended (gently swirl to mix, instead).Ideally bottlefeeding the baby should mimic how a mother breastfeeds her baby. The baby should be fed on cue, or demand, and not according to a rigid schedule. Breastmilk digests in about 90 minutes, so one would expect the feedings to be anywhere from 1.5 hrs to 3 hours apart. (younger babies often need to eat more frequently than older babies).The bottle should be offered gently, in a non-stressful manner, with the baby drawing the nipple into the mouth. The type of bottle or nipple is not as important as the manner in which the bottle is offered. A typical nursing session lasts about 15 to 20 min, and care should be taken to allow baby to take his/her time to drink the bottle, not rushing through a feeding as quickly as possible. Changing position mid-way through a feeding is often recommended, as is holding baby is a more upright position. Propping a bottle is also not recommended.INCREASING YOUR SUPPLYThere are wonderful tips on increasing milk supply below  those that work for nursing mothers also work for mothers who exclusively pump, the biggest difference is that nursing mothers are encouraged to put baby to breast often, and pumping mothers are encouraged to pump often. Probably THE most important thing to remember is to pump often and pump long enough to soften (or empty) the breast.Some little tips to help increase your supply if you really need it. Its nice to have these on hand just in case:First drink plenty of water. I dont drink a ton but I make sure to stay hydrated. Check your pee when you go (I know, sounds funny!). If it is light yellow to clear, you are plenty hydrated.Make sure you eat! While you are pumping, you will keep the weight off, I promise! It can make you hungry as a horse and it does that for a reason. You need the extra calories because you are burning so much off! When I didnt eat enough, I would get really light headed and feel like I was going to drop my babynot good! Eventually, your hunger should taper off (mine has).Eat REAL oatmeal, not the instant. You can eat the quick oats (the ones that cook in 1 minute) or the old fashioned oats (that cook in 5 minutes). You can also make cookies that have oatmeal in them and get oatmeal that way (I prefer this way! Ha!). The way they process the instant oatmeal, it doesnt give you the same results. No one is sure how the oatmeal works but it does!Get some rest (yeah, I know easier said than done!) If you are exhausted and have the opportunity to take a nap (even if it pushes your pump back) do it! You will actually get more milk that way! Even if youre not sleeping, rest by sitting down a lot. Conserving energy is important.Dont stress too much. This all depends on how you personally handle stress. I tend to be a thinker, so I think things out a lot. It has to be some MAJOR stressful situation for it to hurt my supply.Some suggest drinking dark beer, with or without alcohol. Some say its the barley in it or something, that helps to increase supply. Plus some women just swear by the relaxation it gives them! You can have 1 or 2 beers without much crossing into your milk. (Note: Most breastfeeding experts do not routinely recommend using alcohol to boost milk supply. More on alcohol and breastfeeding here.)There is a tea called Mothers Milk Tea and it is supposed to increase your supply if you drink it.There are herbs like Fenugreek and also prescription medications that will increase your supply if you really need it. I would use these as a last resort but they can be effective and are available!Most importantly, good pumping habits will keep your supply up and increase it!PUMPING TRICKS & More Tips For EPing Moms by EPing Moms(aka Tricks of the Trade shared by Shanna)Go hands free! This was the best trick I learned!! I went hands free and set my pump up by my computer and read my pumping board while I pump. It keeps me from looking down into my bottles wondering how much Im getting, being bored out of my mind, and makes time FLY by! You can use an old nursing bra and just cut slits in the flap. Then you just slide the horns through. I did this for a while but I didnt want to wear the cut up bra all day long so that meant I had to literally change bras before each pump. At 7 times a day, that was a bit much!! So, I bought a pumping bra and LOVE it! Its the Easy Expressions bustier.The best thing about this bustier is that it can be worn over any nursing bra. So, when its time to pump, I put the flaps down on my nursing bra, wrap the bustier around, slide the horns through the holes, position them and zip it up. Thats all!The refrigerator trick. This is where you rinse your horns and/or collection bottles after each pumping session. You put them in a ziplock bag (or not, this is optional), and put them in the refrigerator. The idea is that since breast milk is good in the fridge for 5-8 days, any residue left on the horns wont matter. Then you can wash the horns/bottles once at night. I throw mine into the dishwasher (all except the white membranes) and its easy, easy, easy!Storage bags. Many of us started out using the Gerber Seal-N-Go bag but they get very pricey quickly. They are like $5.50 for a box of 25 bags. After researching it online, I found many other women were using regular freezer bags for freezing the milk.MUCH cheaper! Everything Ive read shows that they are safe to use. From what I have found, I only buy Glad and not Ziploc. Ziploc seems to have a much higher rate of leaks. I write the date and amount of ounces on the label with a sharpie and put the milk in and freeze flat. I then take several of them and put them into a gallon size freezer bag and write the dates that are enclosed on the gallon bag. This helps by double bagging and keeping them grouped. This way the corners on the bags wont get poked and possibly cause the bag to leak. Also, whenever I want to get a bag, I can just dig through gallon size bags instead of tons of little bags floating around! : I usually put one or two days worth in a gallon bag. Lube Up! It is perfectly safe to put the lansinoh on before pumping and still use the milk. Putting it on before and after pumping really helps to keep you from getting too sore. Purelan100 is also good (and cheaper). Ive used this from the beginning. You can also rub Olive Oil on the horns and inside the nipple chamber to reduce friction. Olive Oil is antibacterial so it is helpful. This is also safe to use and pump milk with. Ive done both of these and hadnt had a problem. There are times when I seem to get sorer than other times with no real explanation. But, it then goes away as quickly as it came! Who knows!Taking Care of Baby When Pumping. Once I went hands free and had to do those early morning feedings by myself, I would sit on the floor and prop my baby up in her boppy pillow on the floor. I would get hooked up to the pump and start it and pump while I fed her. About the time she was done eating, I was done pumping and I would put her back in bed and go to sleep myself. This will cut down on your time tremendously! It also helps to do this if your pumping time happens to correspond to your babys feeding time during the day. The bouncy seat is my best friend! I would put her in the bouncy seat and bounce it with my foot while surfing the net and pumping. It made time fly by and she was content. You may find other solutions if you have older children, or extra help.Taking Care of Older Children, and Pumping. You may not need a lot of tricks for this one depending on the age of the child, or children. They will probably understand if you just explain that while you are pumping, they cant get up and get things without help. Some tricks other moms had mentioned to keep their other child entertained and kind of reward them would be to go shopping and let your child pick out a special toy or video that she really wants. Then when ever it comes time for you to pump, she can play with it. But, she ONLY gets to play with it when you pump. This helps to make pumping time special for her as well and can help prevent any resentment she might begin to feel.Warnings: Excessive caffeine may cause problems (like keeping the baby wired!). I avoid caffeine completely (except chocolate) but even if you have 1 drink a day, it wont hurt. Just dont go over board. (More on caffeine here.)Medications that have Sudafed (pseudoephedrine HCl) in them can affect milk supply! Be careful!Regular birth control pills will impact milk supply, and some women even have a problem with the mini pill. Breastfeeding (and yes thats what you are doing even if its not from the tap) is a good deterrent for ovulation but not 100% so be careful! However, you may find you get hot flashes and things like that. It is normal because your body is acting like its going through menopause. This suppresses ovulation and allows you to make milk. I thought I was going crazy until I learned this! Ha! Sometimes if you get your period back while pumping, it can decrease your supply. This can be fixed by taking a calcium/magnesium supplement. (I dont have mine back yet and loving it!).WHEN DOES THIS GET EASIER?Around 3 months your supply will probably be established. This is when you can begin to drop the number of times per day that you pump and not see too much of a decrease in total output (this is again, where the spreadsheet comes in handy). Thats why if you do the hard work in the beginning, I promise it will pay off when this time comes! If you dont keep up the number of pumps per day in the beginning, you may continue to have to pump a high number of times per day just to maintain a small supply. Of course, this is all dependent on how each woman produces milk. So, you may have such a great supply and so much frozen that you can drop pumps earlier. I began dropping pumps at 10 weeks and by 3 months I was down to 4 pumps per day! I lost a little with each drop but am currently at 50 ounces per day. Theres no way my baby will ever eat that much so I see no reason to pump more. You will have to decide for yourself. Once you start dropping pumps, you will need to pump longer at each session (because youve gone longer in between pumps and need longer to empty your breasts). This is also dependent on the woman. I pump about 35-40 minutes per pump now on 4 times because I get another let down at about 36 minutes into it!YOU CAN DO THIS!!! I firmly believe that pumping is 10% physical and 90% psychological. If you try to view this as positively as possible, I think you will have a better outcome. Thats why going hands free and doing everything to minimize your stress about pumping is important.A lot of people dont understand pumping. I still get stupid questions like, Why dont you just nurse? Well, DUH! She wont nurse! Ha! You should do whatever makes you comfortable. Sometimes strangers ask me if Im breastfeeding and if I dont feel like dealing with anything, I just say yes. I am after all! Shes just getting it to go instead of from the tap! Ha!Mostly though, I do all I can to educate. I know many women who didnt know this option was even possible and wished they had when breastfeeding didnt work out. Dont listen to doctors or nurses who tell you this isnt possible. There just isnt enough wide spread info out there and unfortunately most health care professionals give really bad advice (like only pump for 10 minutes). So, when they hear back from their patients on how they had supply problems or dried up, they just assume its not possible to pump long term. On my online group, there are women who have been pumping for a year or longer! It is DEFINITELY possible!Most importantly, if for any reason you just dont want to do it anymore, it is perfectly fine! Remember, a happy mommy = a happy baby. You have to do whatever is right for your entire family. Pumping is hard and can take its toll on you. There is no right or wrong when it comes to how you feed your baby! Remember that! We all have days when we want to wean. Thats why support is SOOO important!Related Items from the KellyMom store:Sarah Wells Lizzy Breast Pump Bag in Navy.Use Coupon Code THNXMOMS for 10% off!FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Baby’s Second Night,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/bf-basics/second-night/,"byJan Barger, RN, MA, IBCLC, FILCA. Reprinted with permission from the author.Image courtesy of kit4na / CC BY-2.0 flickr.comYouve made it through your first 24 hours as a new mom. Maybe you have other children, but you are a new mom all over again and now its your babys second night.All of a sudden, your little one discovers that hes no longer back in the warmth and comfort  though a bit crowded  womb where he has spent the last 9 months  and it is SCARY out here! He isnt hearing your familiar heartbeat, the swooshing of the placental arteries, the soothing sound of your lungs or the comforting gurgling of your intestines. Instead, hes in a crib, swaddled, in a diaper, a tee-shirt, a hat and a blanket. All sorts of people have been handling him, and hes not yet become accustomed to the new noises, lights, sounds and smells. He has found one thing though, and thats his voice and you find that each time you take him off the breast where he comfortably drifted off to sleep, and put him in the bassinet  he protests, loudly!In fact, each time you put him back on the breast he nurses for a little bit and then goes to sleep. As you take him off and put him back to bed  he cries again and starts rooting around, looking for you. This goes on  seemingly for hours. A lot of moms are convinced it is because their milk isnt in yet, and the baby is starving. However, it isnt that, but the babys sudden awakening to the fact that the most comforting and comfortable place for him to be is at the breast. Its the closest to home he can get. It seems that this is pretty universal among babies  lactation consultants all over the world have noticed the same thing.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.So, what do you do? When he drifts off to sleep at the breast after a good feed, break the suction and take your nipple gently out of his mouth. Dont move him except to gently slide him into an upright neutral position with his head to the side. Dont try and burp him  just snuggle with him until he falls into a deep sleep where he wont be disturbed by being moved. Babies go into a light sleep state (REM) first, and then cycle in and out of REM and deep sleep about every  hour or so. If he starts to root and act as though he wants to go back to breast, thats fine this is his way of settling and comforting. During deep sleep, the babys breathing is very quiet and regular, and there is no movement beneath his eyelids.Another helpful hint his hands were his best friends in utero he could suck on his thumb or his fingers anytime he was the slightest bit disturbed or uncomfortable. And all of a sudden hes had them taken away from him and someone has put mittens on him! He has no way of soothing himself with those mittens on. Babies need to touch  to feel  and even his touch on your breast will increase your oxytocin levels which will help boost your milk supply! So take the mittens off and loosen his blanket so he can get to his hands. He might scratch himself, but it will heal very rapidly  after all, he had fingernails when he was inside you, and no one put mittens on him then!By the way  this might happen every once in a while at home too, particularly if youve changed his environment such as going to the doctors, to church, to the mall, or to the grandparents! Dont let it throw you  sometimes babies just need some extra snuggling at the breast, because for the baby, the breast is home.Copyright  by Jan Barger, RN, MA, IBCLC, FILCALactation Education ConsultantsNo portion of this text may be copied or reproduced in any manner, electronically or otherwise, without the express written permission of the author (IBCLC@aol.com).Jan Barger is a mom of three, and proud Grammie of three and one due in 2017.

Lactation yoga …side-lying nursing without getting up to switch sides,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/bf-basics/lactation-yoga/,"or side-lying nursing without         getting up to switch sidesby Eva Lyford. Reprinted with permission from                 the author. If youve mastered the art of side-lying to nurse, then the next                 trick is to be able to nurse off the top breast so that you dont                 have to change sides of the bed at night. If you co-sleep and breastfeed,                 then Im sure youve had an experience like mine at some point.                 Youre all snuggled in, warmly and cozily cuddled with your baby.                 You are breastfeeding in the side-lying position and drowse off                 to sleep. waking a while later to find that baby is hungry again,                 and unfortunately the most convenient breast is the least full one.                 Until I figured out this lactation yoga, I used to have to flip                 myself over the baby to get myself into position, and then scoot                 the baby over  thats no fun! This position is a bit tricky, but                 if you get it right then it is very easy. Also, using this technique                 I dont have to worry about baby falling out of bed  hes always                 safely in-between my husband and I in the family bed.This works best if the baby has drained the bottom breast first;                 for this discussion lets assume left side. Trying this when the                 left side is not drained can be uncomfortable, and might lead to                 plugged ducts. When nursing a young baby on the bottom (left)                 breast remember that you have to prop baby on babys side with a                 small pillow or rolled towel. (Older babies may do fine without.)                 To nurse off the top (right) breast take the prop away so baby                 is on their back again, then lean over the baby a bit. Then, the                 baby should now face upwards, instead of to the side like when nursing                 on the left breast. Roll forwards a bit so that your shoulders and                 pelvis are now tipped slightly forward, at about a 60 degree angle                 or so from the bed. I find it sometimes helpful to put my top                 arm straight out, pointing towards the headboard for balance. Bend                 and move your right leg out to provide more stability. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.For extra support, you can put your right hand down on the other                 side of the baby, but if you need this you are probably tipped too                 far forward, or the baby is too little yet. But it can be handy                 to do this until you find your sweet spot or the baby grows a bit. Also dont try to use your left hand to support your head  your                 left arm should be straight out or bent to pillow your head instead.                 Your neck should be straight in line with your spinal column; dont                 jut your chin out or tuck it in excessively. Doing so can cause                 back pain afterwards. When done as Ive described, my baby does not have trouble breathing                 and is not actually under me. Ive found this works better with                 an older baby (after about 3 months or so) because of their greater                 muscle control. Let me note that chiropractors/physical therapists might not like                 this approach (because the back is twisted for a time), but it works.                 And, it is essentially the same as positions that I have used while                 doing yoga for years, except that Im nursing. If you feel at any                 time that your baby will not be safe in this position, then dont                 do it. FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Weaning from formula supplements,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/nb-challenges/decrease-formula/,"Put baby to breast oftenAim for 10 breastfeeding sessons per day. If baby is not breastfeeding well, work with your lactation consultant.Image credit: Jerry Bunkers on flickrMethod for weaning from supplementsDo not drop supplements suddenly  this should be a gradual process.Prepare: Talk to babys health care provider and get his/her input. Record supplement amounts for a few days to determine how much supplement baby is getting per day. Use expressed milk for supplements if available. If you dont have enough expressed milk, add banked milk or formula.Days 1-3: Take the current supplement amount (#1) and reduce by 1 oz (30 mL). Note that youre not reducing 1 oz at every feeding, but 1 oz over the entire day. Monitor babys wet & dirty diapers. If diaper count is good, then do not exceed this amount of supplement each day  keep putting baby back to the breast if he wants to eat more.Days 4-6: Take the current supplement amount (#2) and reduce by 1 oz (30 mL). Monitor babys wet & dirty diapers. If diaper count is good, then do not exceed this amount of supplement each day  keep putting baby back to the breast if he wants to eat more.Days 7-9: Take the current supplement amount (#3) and reduce by 1-2 oz (30-60 mL)  try 2 oz if things are going well. Monitor babys wet & dirty diapers. If diaper count is good, then do not exceed this amount of supplement each day  keep putting baby back to the breast if he wants to eat more.Continue the above method, slowly reducing the amount of supplement every 2-3 days as long as babys diaper count and weight gain indicate that hes getting enough milk. Once you get to the point that the supplements are only expressed milk (no formula), then you can usually proceed at a faster paceat this point you are making enough milk for baby and just need to transition baby to getting milk only at the breast (when not separated from mom).If babys weight gain or diaper count are borderline or inappropriate, then spend several more days at the same supplement level, or return to the previous supplement level and proceed at a slower pace.Monitor babys growth. Weigh baby at least once a week to ensure that he is gaining appropriately. Get another weight check a week after baby is completely back to the breast, to reassure yourself that things are going well. Keep in touch with babys health care provider throughout this process.Pump to increase supplyPumping will help you to increase supply faster, plus you will be able to use your milk instead of formula for any needed supplements. Your aim in pumping is to remove more milk from the breasts and/or to empty the breasts more often. The more milk you remove, the more milk you will produce.A hospital-grade double pump will save time and maximize your pumping efforts.Until supply is well established, it is important to get at least eight good nursing and/or pumping sessions per 24 hours. Ten sessions per day is better.If baby does not breastfeed at a feeding, pump for 20-30 minutes, or for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. If baby breastfeeds, but does not soften the breast well, pump for 10-15 minutes after nursing. If baby softens the breast well, then adding pumping sessions between breastfeeding sessions is most helpful.Empty the breast as thoroughly as possible at each session. To ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. Use breast massage prior to pumping, and massage and compressions during pumping to better empty the breasts and increase pumping output.This method of reducing supplements was adapted from the methods used by Kathy Kuhn  Thanks, Kathy!Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Go to  Breastfeeding Log  Weaning from supplementsGo to professional handouts to view handouts on weaning from supplementsMore information on transitioning baby back to breastfeedingHelp  My Baby Wont Nurse!Relactation and Adoptive NursingWeaning from a nipple shield@ other websitesThe Finish at the Breast Method of Supplementation  Christina Smillie, MD, IBCLC, suggests an alternative way to use bottles for supplementation that she believes results in less supplementation, improved feeding at breast, less need for pumping, and an ultimately greater milk supply as a result of improved milk removal.Info from by Kathy Kuhn, IBCLC on reducing supplements: Weaning from Supplements, In: Supplementing the Breastfed Baby by Paula YountFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Growth spurts,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/growth-spurts/,"duron12345 - Fotolia.comMost babies go through several growth spurts (also called frequency days) during the first 12 months.What is a growth spurt?During a growth spurt, breastfed babies nurse more often than usual (sometimes as often as every hour) and often act fussier than usual.The increase in babys milk intake during growth spurts is temporary. In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months. As solids are gradually introduced after six months, babys milk intake will gradually decrease.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Physical growth is not the only reason that babies may have a temporary need for increased nursing. Babies often exhibit the same type of behavior (increased nursing with or without increased fussiness) when they are working on developmental advances such as rolling over, crawling, walking or talking. Moms milk is for growing the brain as well as the body!When do babies have growth spurts?Common times for growth spurts are during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). Babies dont read calendars, however, so your baby may do things differently.Growth spurts dont stop after the first year  most moms notice growth spurts every few months during the toddler years and periodically thereafter on through the teenage years.How long do growth spurts last?Growth spurts usually last 2-3 days, but sometimes last a week or so.What is the best way to handle a growth spurt?Follow your childs lead. Baby will automatically get more milk by nursing more frequently, and your milk supply will increase due to the increased nursing. It is not necessary (or advised) to supplement your baby with formula or expressed milk during a growth spurt. Supplementing (and/or scheduling feeds) interferes with the natural supply and demand of milk production and will prevent your body from getting the message to make more milk during the growth spurt.Some nursing moms feel more hungry or thirsty when baby is going through a growth spurt. Listen to your body  you may need to eat or drink more during the time that baby is nursing more often.See My baby is fussy!

The Distractible Baby,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/distractible-baby/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIs my baby distractible?What can I do about it?Additional Information Is my baby distractible?Latch on, suck a moment, pull off latch on, suck a moment,                 pull off. Nurse a minute, pull away to smile at mom. Nurse a minute,                 pull away to see who just walked in the room. Nurse a minute, pull                 away to listen to the TV. Nurse a moment, pull away because the                 dog wagged his tail.Sound familiar?? Baby starts to nurse and just as soon as your                 milk starts to let-down, baby pulls off and wiggles around in your                 lap. Babies aged two to six months are notorious for pulling off                 the breast at any distraction (real or imaginary) and tend to forget                 to let go before they turn around (ouch!).This is a passing developmental stage that can be quite a nuisance                  its usually at its worst between four and five months. At around                 2 months, your baby will become able to see things clearly across                 the room. At around 3 months, hell start to stay awake longer and                 take a greater interest in the world around him. Your baby is also                 beginning to recognize that he is separate from mom. All of these                 things can result in a distractible baby. When baby first becomes                 aware of the rest of the world, he will have a hard time concentrating                 on nursing. In effect, he will be unable to walk and chew gum at                 the same time. Once he gets a little older, hell find it easier                 to both nurse and take in the world around him at the same time.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Distractibility is also common around 8-10 months, and can lead                 mom to think that her baby is trying to wean. If your baby is younger                 than a year, its highly unlikely that this temporary disinterest                 is self-weaning. Its very rare for a baby younger than 12 months                 to self-wean. What can I do about it?Many moms find it more and more difficult to nurse a distractible                 baby, and sometimes even interpret it personally (I dont want                 mom any more or I dont want to nurse any more). At the very                 least, its frustrating to deal with a distractible baby. Less frequent/shorter                 nursing during this distractible stage can lead to a low                 milk supply, so do your best to get in a few decent feedings                 during the day.Until this stage has passed, baby may need a quiet place to nurse                 and/or more night nursing until hes figured out how to deal with                 distraction. Do take advantage of night nursing during this                 time  it doesnt matter when baby takes in his calories                 during a 24-hour period. One study showed that older babies can                 consume as much as 25% of their total daily intake of mothers milk                 during the night, probably partly because of daytime distractibility.Nursing in a quiet, darkened, boring room often helps. Talk in                 quiet, soothing tones (if you talk at all). Nurse while lying down;                 nap nurse. Cover baby with a shawl or put him in a sling to nurse.                 Nursing while in motion (walking, rocking) can also help baby to                 focus better on nursing. Try to catch your baby when hes more willing,                 such as when hes just waking up, already a little sleepy, or actually                 asleep. Babys initial pulling off is probably not an indication                 that he is finished  just an indication that he saw/heard something                 interesting across the room. When he pulls off, try to coax him                 back to the breast a few more times before giving up.If baby pulls away without letting go, keep a finger ready to                 break the suction as soon as he starts to pull away. You can also                 nurse baby in the football (clutch) hold so you have better control                 of his head, or nurse him in the cradle hold in a sling. This type                 of behavior sometimes leads to biting; if your baby bites, see When                 Baby Bites.If baby is not nursing as much because of distractibility, offer                 the breast often (even when he doesnt ask to nurse). Make up                 for lost time by nursing more often during the night. Older babies                 may nurse better if you try different and novel nursing positions                 in which they have more control  baby standing up, sitting on your                 lap facing you, etc.Additional informationWakeful 4 Month Olds by Jan Barger,                 RN, MA, IBCLC @ Breastfeeding                 as Baby Grows.

Reverse Cycling,http://kellymom.com/bf/normal/reverse-cycling/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCWhat is reverse cycling?Reverse cycling is               when baby nurses frequently at night and less frequently during the day.Why do some babies reverse cycle?Newborns may reverse cycle in the early days or weeks simply because they have their days and nights mixed up. Distractible (and/or very active) babies or toddlers   may nurse more at night to make up for missed or shortened nursing   sessions during the day.If mom is very distracted or busy during the day, baby   may nurse more at night to make up for missed or shortened nursing   sessions, or simply to  get more uninterrupted time with mom. If mom is away from baby during the day, baby may take just enough milk (by bottle or cup) to take the edge off                 his hunger, then wait for mom to return to get the bulk of his                 calories. Baby will typically nurse more often and/or longer than                 usual once mom returns. Some mothers encourage reverse cycling so                 they wont need to pump                 as much milk. Reverse cycling is common for  breastfed babies who are away from mom part of the day,                especially those just starting out with the bottle.Tips for handling  reverse cyclingGeneral coping tips for interrupted sleep:Sleep late or go to bed early when possible. When youre at home with baby, nap when your baby naps. Keep baby as close as possible during the night to maximize sleep for everyone. Some options are to have baby in bed   with you, in a bed adjoining your bed, or in a bed in the same room.

During babys night wakings, keep everything calm,   quiet, and dark (if you need a light to breastfeed, try using a smaller   light like a nightlight or closet light). At some point you may want to   begin a bedtime routine (such as bath, story, breastfeeding) to signal   that nighttime has begun. When mom is busy or distracted:Consider using a sling or other baby carrier so that baby can be with you and breastfeed while you go about your day.Be aware of babys typical breastfeeding routine, and   remember to watch for babys cues on busy days  this is easiest when   baby is close by. Be aware that after a really busy day (we all have   them!), your child may need some one-on-one time with mom to breastfeed   and reconnect.

If baby is reverse cycling and taking very little milk when mom is away at work:Be patient. Try not to stress about it. Consider it a compliment  baby prefers you! Use small amounts of expressed milk per bottle so there is less waste. If youre worrying that baby cant go that long without more milk, keep in mind that some babies sleep through the night for 8 hours or so without mom needing to worry that baby is not eating during that time period. Keep an eye on wet diapers and weight gain to assure yourself that baby is getting   enough milk.Ensure that baby has ample chance to nurse when youre together.If you prefer to pump less milk while youre away from baby, you may choose to encourage baby to reverse cycle.

Breastfeeding in Public,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/legal/bfip/,"CommentaryLinksMore commentaries on breastfeeding in publicTips for breastfeeding in publicLegal informationBreastfeeding in public tends to be controversial. However, if a bottle-fed baby can have her dinner in public, why shouldnt a breastfed baby have the same rights? I have certainly never seen a public restroom that I would like to feed my baby in! And Im certainly not going to stay cooped up at home all the time because Im afraid that my baby will get hungry while were gone.I nursed my daughter in public from the time that we started going out (when she was about 6 weeks old) until she was no longer wishing to nurse when we were out and about (probably around 2 1/2 or so). My son started nursing in public at the ripe old age of two days, and still nurses pretty often when we are out (hes 12 months now). If my child is hungry or just wants to nurse, then he gets to nurse. After 12-18 months, I sometimes offer baby a snack or a drink of water to hold him until we can go somewhere more convenient, but if he still insists that he wants to nurse I let him. So far no one has ever commented on it; as far as I can tell, no one has even noticed. Weve nursed walking through stores (we all love our sling!), at the state fair, at practically every restaurant weve ever been to, at parks, at the beach, at a hockey game, at movies and plays well, weve nursed pretty much everywhere.I, personally, have never put a blanket over my nursing baby, though some moms are more comfortable doing this. I feel it just draws attention to the fact that Im nursing (I know I always notice this when someone else does it). Besides, I live in Florida and its just too hot for something like that! As long as your baby isnt looking around every few seconds (Ive experienced this occasionally and now Im fast), a loose t-shirt and the baby will keep you perfectly covered and modest. If youve never nursed in public and are nervous about what people might see, practice in front of a mirror or a good friend or your husband. Go to a La Leche League meeting. Its a good place to practice  there are always mothers nursing there  and you can get tips from experienced mothers on public nursing.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I have heard of mothers getting negative comments and nasty looks when breastfeeding in public. This is really sad. When someone sees a nursing ANIMAL they will say, oh, how cute! Shouldnt a nursing baby get the same reaction (if any at all)? Besides, a nursing baby should be much more welcome than a screaming baby who needs to eat. I know so many nursing moms (including myself) who have gotten really nice comments from the surrounding passengers on airplanes. And, by the way, breastfeeding in public is not illegal and is not indecent exposure  anywhere! Many states have laws expressly saying this. Some moms even carry a copy of the law in their diaper bag or purse. I know that in my state (Florida), a mother is legally allowed to breastfeed her child any place that she is legally allowed to be, so as long as youre not trespassing, youre fine.So if you are breastfeeding, please dont stay at home! Go out, have some fun, and nurse in public. The more often mothers nurse in public, the more accepted it will become.More commentaries on breastfeeding in publicWhats So Hard About Covering Up to Breastfeed in Public?and More breastfeeding in public concerns byAnnie ReneauGetting Off the Back Room Team from the LLL websiteFrom Bashful to Brazen: The Indiscreet Breastfeeders Manifesto by Sundae Horn, from Mothering, Issue 109, November/December 2001Breastfeeding in Public Is a Basic Civil Right by Nancy M.

Reading ability is associated with breast feeding for the entire group, boys showing the effect more clearly than girls. 3. A high degree of association was found between reading ability and speech clarity. 4. There is an association between breast feeding and confidence. There is evidence that the feeding effect is different for both sexes and that differences exist between the two regions.Broad FE. The effects of infant feeding on speech quality. N Z Med J. 1972 Jul;76(482):28-31.There was a distinct relationship between breast feeding and clarity of speech in the male. Breast feeding was associated with improved tonal quality in both male and female children with a more marked improvement in the case of the male The dramatic effect of breast feeding on the development of speech and reading in boys as revealed in this study suggests that the natural breast feeding method accelerates the rate of maturation of the male infant.FacebookPinterestTwitter"

A 10% weight loss is sometimes considered normal, but this amount of weight loss is a sign that the breastfeeding needs to be evaluated. Its a good idea to have a routine weight check at 5 days (baby should be gaining rather than losing weight by day 5), so that any developing problems can be caught and remedied early.Baby should regain birth weight by 10 days to 2 weeks. If your baby lost a good bit of weight in the early days, or if your baby is sick or premature, it may take longer to regain birth weight. If baby does not regain birth weight by two weeks, this is a sign that the breastfeeding needs to be evaluated.Always figure weight gain from the lowest point rather than from babys birth weight.Baby needs to be weighed on the same scale with the same amount of clothing (preferably naked) each time to get an accurate picture of weight gain. Different scales can give very different readings (Ive personally seen a difference of a pound in two different scales); clothing or diapers can vary in weight and throw the numbers off. The scale should be zeroed before weighing, and baby should be centered on the scale tray. Its never a bad idea to do a second measurement (it should be close to the first) and then use an average of the two measurements. If your baby is very active or distressed, dont expect to get an accurate measurement. Babies grow in spurts rather than at a steady rate  to keep from needless worrying, its generally best to weigh baby no more often than once a week.Additional information and references@ Growth charts for breastfed babiesInfant growth calculatorsResources: Is baby getting enough milk?Is my older baby getting enough milk?Increasing low milk supplyHow might I increase babys weight gain?Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?How can I find help for my breastfeeding problem?@ other websitesLook at the Baby, Not the Scale by Dr. Jay Gordon and Cheryl Taylor WhiteHow much weight should I expect my breastfeeding baby to gain? by William Sears, MDHealthy and Petite by Joyce Schaal, from New Beginnings, Vol. 15 No. 1, January  February 1998, p. 8-10.Articles on Weight Issues from New BeginningsGrowth Failure by Stephen Kemp, MD, PhD and Neslihan Gngr, MD, from emedicine.comAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Policy Statement on the Importance of BreastfeedingMohrbacher N.Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple.

Lopsided! What can I do?,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/lopsided/,"When baby prefers one side, or when supply or breast size is greater on one sideBy Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIs this a problem?Why does it happen?Evening things upPersuading baby to nurse better on the less preferred sideWill baby get enough milk?Is this a problem?Most women notice differences in milk supply, pumping output, milk flow and/or size between breasts. As with many other things (foot size, ring size, eyesight, etc.) asymmetry is normal in humans. In some women the difference between breasts is hardly noticeable; in others it is very noticeable. There is every variation in between. This is not usually a problem in terms of the breastfeeding relationship, so you certainly dont need to do anything about it if the asymmetry does not bother you or baby; however some mothers prefer to even things out, particularly if there is a very noticable difference in breast size.Sometimes babies will refuse or fuss at a breast when the let-down is slower or too forceful, or the supply a bit lower. They in turn will prefer the side which lets down more/less quickly and in which the supply is more bountiful.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Why does it happen?Possible reasons for variations in supply/milk flow between breasts:Normal anatomical differences. All women have one breast that has more working ducts and alveoli than the other (usually the left side, though either is normal). Some women also have differences between the two areola/nipples (inverted, flat, different shape/size) which make it easier for baby to latch on to one side than the other.Babys preference for one side. Most babies have a side preference to some extent. From the start, your baby may feel more comfortable being held on one side and therefore nurse it more efficiently and/or more frequently.Mothers preference for one side. Mom (consciously or subconsciously) may offer one side more than the other because she feels more comfortable nursing on that side.Breast surgery or injury. If one breast was ever operated on or injured in any way, supply and/or milk flow can be affected.If your newborn is refusing one side, have her doctor do a good physical exam to check for birth injuries. Some babies will have an injury that goes unnoticed at birth, but causes baby discomfort when in certain nursing positions.If baby suddenly begins to refuse one side, it could be caused by an ear infection or other illness in baby (making nursing painful or uncomfortable on that side), an injury to baby (or something else, such as a sore immunization site) that makes nursing painful in that position, or a breast infection in that breast (which can make the milk taste salty). Many babies who refuse one side do so because mom has a much faster or slower letdown on one side (baby might prefer either the faster or slower flow). If all other possible causes are ruled out and baby continues to refuse one side, then consider seeing your doctor just to rule out any breast problems.Evening things upIt is fine to just do nothing, but if the lopsidedness is bothering you, you can try to increase milk supply on the smaller side to increase the supply/breast size/milk flow on that side. Be careful, though, not to neglect the larger producing breast too much and allow too much backup of milk in that breast, because that may make you vulnerable to plugged ducts and mastitis.Here are some things that can help to even things up (you dont need to do them all; start off with the one thing that looks most workable for you):Start baby on the smaller side for each feeding for a few days (baby usually nurses more vigorously on the first breast offered).Nurse on the smaller side twice as often. For instance if you nurse on one side per feeding, you might nurse on the small side for two feedings, the larger side for one, then back to the smaller side for the next two feedings, etc.Pump the smaller side for 5-10 minutes after some feedings.Add an extra pumping session (for 10-20 minutes  smaller side only) in between feedings.If the larger side becomes overfull, express just enough milk to relieve the pressure. Most mothers notice an evening out of some proportion within 3-5 days of doing these things. Most moms use these measures for a short time only, until they get the desired results, but others continue long-term.There may always be a small degree of difference in breast size  at least to your own eyes. If there is an obvious difference in appearance through your clothing, you may want want to use nursing pads to give a more even appearance. Usually a difference in size is much more noticeable to you than to anyone else.Persuading baby to nurse better on the less preferred sideTry starting your baby on the preferred breast and then once let-down occurs, slide her over to the other side without changing the position of her body. For example, start her in the cradle position and then slide her over into the football position.Continue to try different nursing positions.Offer this breast to your baby when she is just waking up but not fully awake or already a little sleepy. She is more likely to instinctively nurse at this time.Nurse in a darkened and quiet room.Offer this side with motion; i.e. walk, sway, bounce, rock, etc. until your baby startsnursing well.If let-down on the less preferred side is too fast or slow, follow the suggestions in Let-down Reflex: Too slow? or Forceful Let-down ReflexIf supply on the less preferred side is low, follow the suggestions above and in Increasing low milk supply.If baby seems to want a faster flow from the less preferred side, then try doing breast compressions to speed the flow.See the suggestions in Help  My Baby Wont Nurse!Patience and persistence are key. Keep trying, and praise baby when she nurses well. Most of the time a baby will take the less-preferred breast with time. If baby is refusing or nursing rarely on one side, you may need to pump this side as often as the baby is nursing the other side in order to better maintain your milk supply.Will baby get enough milk?Yes  your baby can get all that she needs as long as she is allowed to nurse as often as she wishes  even if you nurse exclusively on only one side. If there is simply a difference in supply between breasts, baby will adjust her nursing to compensate. Overall milk production is generally not a concern unless other factors are involved.If baby is completely refusing one side, youll want to pump that side as often as she nurses to maintain supply until you get her back nursing on that side.If all else fails, one-sided nursing is very possible as long as your baby is allowed tonurse without restriction. The side that you are not nursing on, once allowed to dry up, will be smaller than the other side. This will result in some degree of lopsidedness (though it may not be obvious), but this will remedy itself once weaning occurs.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding after a Cesarean Birth,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/newborn-concerns/c-section/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC. Martin Valigursky  Fotolia.comThese are a collection of suggestions for nursing after a cesarean birth. You can do it!Educate yourself and arrange for breastfeeding helpFind a La Leche League group near you! Try to attend at least one meeting before your baby is born. Ask questions!Talk to the lactation consultant (LC)assuming your hospital has one on staffand ask that she meet with you as soon as you get out of the operating room. She can help you position your baby as painlessly as possible. If an LC is not available, ask one of the nurses and/or have your partner or another helper available to help out.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.What about anesthesia and medications?The anesthesia and any pain meds you are given should not affect your milk. There are many pain meds that are compatible with breastfeeding, so be sure to ask your doctor for one that is commonly used for breastfeeding mothers. Do try to use medications only as needed, to reduce the amount of sleepiness in you or your baby. Excess sleepiness can make breastfeeding challenging in the beginning. Here are suggestions for waking a sleepy baby.A low grade fever in the mother is common during the early days after a cesarean birth, and should not be a reason to separate the mom and baby. As long as the mother washes her hands well before touching the baby, there is no reason for separation, even if the mother has an infection.First nursing after birthIf possible, the time immediately after your baby is born is a great time to start breastfeeding. You will still be under the effects of the spinal/epidural and probably not yet feeling any discomfort. You will likely have to nurse lying on your back, because of the epidural. Since one arm may be restrained, it may get a little tricky. Try positioning baby lying face down across your breasts (similar to cradle hold, but baby is higher up and away from your incision, and mom is lying flat). When nursing in this position with a newborn, have someone nearby to make sure babys nose doesnt get blocked, since you both may be groggy from the meds. Have your partner or a nurse help position the baby, and use lots of pillows around you to help with support.Nurse early and oftenIdeally, youll want to put your baby to breast within the first hour. Studies show that when time to breast is longer than this, babies have more difficulty breastfeeding and engorgement is more severe. If something prevents the baby from being put to breast within the first hour, you should begin pumping with a hospital-grade breastpump.Watch for your babys hunger cues. Breastfeeding at least every 2 hours during the day with a nighttime span no longer than 4 hours is highly recommendedyoure aiming for 10-12 feedings per 24 hours during the early weeks. As long as baby is nursing well, there should be no need for any supplements of any kind (i.e. formula or sugar water).Nursing positionsOnce you can turn over, try turning to one side and nursing in a side-lying position (see below). Have your partner or a nurse help you with positioning pillows.Another position that may be more comfortable is the football hold. Sit somewhat upright in the bed and place the baby on a pillow, between your arm and your side, with your hand cupping the underside of his head.You may find at first that its difficult to find a comfortable nursing position. Try experimenting as much as possible to get the most comfortable position, and dont hesitate to ask for help getting positioned from your partner, nurses, or the hospital lactation consultant. Whichever position works best, make sure the babys tummy is towards you. You might want to bring a few extra pillows from home (or a nursing pillow), as hospital pillows are pretty small and flat.Many moms find the side-lying position the most comfortable during the first day or so. Its an easy way to nurse and rest at the same time. Using a small blanket, or pillow  even a rolled up towel  can help protect your incision while you nurse lying down.Below are step-by-step instructions on getting into the side-lying position (in a hospital bed) after a c-section:Begin with the bed in a flat position and side rails up.Use extra pillows behind the mothers back for extra support.Carefully roll to one side while grasping the side rail and relaxing the abdominal muscles. Move slowly to avoid strain.To protect the incision from the babys kicking, cover the abdomen with a small pillow or towel.Place a pillow between the legs to minimize the strain on the stomach muscles.Lean back into the pillows behind the back.When using side-lying position, baby should be placed on his side, facing your body, chest to chest, so he doesnt have to turn his head to nurse. Babys feet should be drawn in close to your body with his head either lying on the bed, or on your arm, whichever feels most comfortable to you. You can either roll your body forward to latch, or pull the baby toward you.(Thanks to Kathy Kuhn, IBCLC for these tips)Avoid supplementsBe sure to let the hospital staff know they shouldnt give any supplemental bottles or pacifiers, as these artificial nipples can cause problems with breastfeeding. If you are told that supplements are medically necessary, request that they be given via cup or feeding syringe rather than a bottle to avoid the risk of nipple confusion.You can request that your doctor provide written orders that the baby is to be breastfed, and have no artificial nipples of any kind (no pacifiers or bottles) and that IF supplements are medically required, they should be given by an alternative method rather than by bottle.When will my milk come in?The abrupt hormonal shift that occurs at the separation of the placenta from the uterus is what signals your milk to come in. Thus moms body will get the same signal whether she has a cesarean or vaginal birth. Moms who have stressful births (cesarean or vaginal) tend to have their milk come in a little bit later.Your milk may come in anywhere from day 2 to day 6 (usually around days 2-3). If your milk is slow coming in, try not to worry, but put baby to breast as often as possible and stay in contact with your lactation consultant so she can monitor how baby is doing. Using these tips on how to be sure baby is getting enough milk will also reassure you. Baby can do quite well on colostrum alone in the early days, as nature intended.To encourage an abundant milk supply:Nurse as soon after birth as possible. If something prevents the baby from being put to breast within the 4-6 hours, you should begin pumping with a hospital-grade breastpump. Get the okay from your doctor/midwife ahead of time to nurse your baby in the recovery room  this shouldnt be a problem unless you or baby are having medical problems.Nurse frequently. Breastfeed your baby at least every 2 hours (from beginning of nursing to beginning of the next nursing) during the day, with no more than 4 hours between nursings at night. Youre aiming for at least 10-12 nursings per 24 hours. More frequent nursing results in greater milk production at one week and thereafter.Avoid unnecessary supplements. Do not supplement baby with anything (formula, water, etc) unless it is medically indicated. Supplementing will do two things  missing feedings will reduce breast stimulation and milk removal (both needed to increase milk supply), and babies who are supplemented tend to need to eat again later than if they had nursed  so again youre losing much-needed nursing time.Ensure that baby is nursing well. If baby is not latching well and transferring milk well, then it can affect milk supply and the speed that your milk comes in.Going homeIf all is going well, some moms prefer to ask for an earlier discharge so they are not at the hospital an extended length of time. If you do this, be sure that you have some help at home, and try to get as much rest and nourishment as possible  especially fluids. Do see if there is a lactation consultant (IBCLC) at the hospital (or another local lactation consultant) who will make at least a couple of home visits to be sure all is going well with breastfeeding, and help you (if necessary) to fine-tune positioning and latching.Get help around the house postpartum. If possible, have your partner take a few days to several weeks off work (as much as you can afford!) to help out. You wont be up to housework at ALL at first. Even accomplishing basic tasks for your own and your babys needs will be tough. This is major surgery. Your body will need time to recover. If taking time off is not an option for your partner, look into getting others to help. Do you have friends or family who can check in on you? Someone to help with the laundry, dishes and cooking? Can you pay a professional to clean up once a week (this will make you feel better)? You could hire a local 13+ year old to help out. Ask at church (if you attend), your local school, or even your local Girl Scout troop. It will be very helpful if you can find someone who can come for an hour or two every afternoon to do dishes, laundry, straighten up, and maybe even keep an eye on the baby while you shower or potty or nap.Other C-Section ResourcesBreastfeeding After a Cesarean by Anne Smith, IBCLCBreastfeeding After a Cesarean by Dr. William SearsC-section recovery tips from other momsGeneral links on getting a good start to nursing @ Information is Your Ally in preparing to breastfeed: 10 Tips for SuccessNursing your newborn  what to expect in the early weeksBreastfeeding BasicsFacebookPinterestTwitter"

And I have others that I have on my list to do as necessary, that I like, and want to try if/when a situation comes up.Buy this book from Amazon.comFacebookPinterestTwitter"
I’m Made of Mama’s Milk,http://kellymom.com/uncategorized/review_mamas-milk/,"written, illustrated & published by Mary OlsenISBN: 0-9715374-0-2 review byUta Mattox, CD (DONA)Birth Doula, Childbirth Educator, Breastfeeding AdvocateThis is a picture board book about the experience of a toddler breastfeeding. It is written from her perspective, in simple rhymes, with real, soft-focused photos as illustration. In effect it is a book for toddlers by a toddler. It even has a special interactive surprise at the end of the book (a reflecting foil as a mirror), which all toddlers will love.I love it because it is a very positive book about breastfeeding, it is for young children, yet older children and grown-ups will take away the message how valuable breastfeeding beyond infancy is. And the photos will make it very easy for young children to recognize familiar scenes and situations very easily.Im Made of Mamas MilkMary OlsenBest Price $18.62or Buy New Privacy InformationFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Amamantando a un bebe mayor de un año,http://kellymom.com/translatation/spanish/toddlernursing-spanish/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC   Traduccin: Rosana AbrutzkyEsts considerando la posibilidad de amamantar a tu bebe                 ms all del ao, y te preocupa la forma en                 que se desarrollar la relacin de lactancia? Te preguntas                 si tu hijo est por destetarse, o por qu causa parece                 que mamara durante todo el da? Aqu encontrars                 algunas observaciones relativas al comportamiento tpico                 del bebe mayorcito respecto a la lactancia. Por supuesto, la forma                 en que tu bebe se relaciona con la lactancia depender de                 su personalidad nica.Cunto duran las sesiones de amamantamiento?Cun a menudo lactan los bebes mayores de un ao?Qu posiciones resultan mejores para amamantar bebes mayorcitos?AcrobaciasSi amamanto ms all del ao, despus ser ms difcil destetar?Cmo es el auto-destete?Cunto duran las sesiones                 de amamantamiento?En primer lugar, es normal que las mamadas se acorten a medida                 que el bebe crece  esto no implica necesariamente que el                 nio est listo para destetarse. A medida que el bebe                 crece, es capaz de obtener la leche en forma ms eficiente                 (ya se ha convertido en un mamador experto), y por ello no necesita                 tanto tiempo para conseguir la misma cantidad de leche. Otro de                 los factores que entra a jugar en este momento es la distraccin,                 el bebe se interesa tanto por las cosas que suceden a su alrededor                 que prefiere no tomarse tanto tiempo para amamantar. Una mamada                 tpica de un bebe mayor de un ao puede durar slo                 un par de minutos, el tiempo necesario para tomar un sorbo y reconectarse                 un momento con la mam antes de correr a seguir descubriendo                 el mundo. Las mamadas de la siesta, de antes de dormir y la primer                 mamada de la maana usualmente duran un poco ms,                 en tanto el bebe puede estar sooliento y no tan dispuesto                 a sumergirse en las cosas que lo rodean.Cun a menudo lactan los                 bebes mayores de un ao?La frecuencia de amamantamiento de los bebes mayores suele ser                 errtica y vara grandemente de un nio a otro.                 Es normal que los nios de esta edad estn muy interesados                 en el mundo que los rodea, y como resultado, no tan interesados                 en amamantar. En otros momentos el bebe puede focalizarse ms                 en los enormes cambios que suceden en su interior (desarrollo),                 y querr pasar mucho tiempo al pecho para reconectarse con                 la madre y poder ajustarse a sus nuevas habilidades y capacidades.                 Algunos nios maman muy a menudo (como un recin                 nacido es un comentario que se escucha frecuentemente en                 boca de mams de nios entre 12 y 15 meses), algunos                 maman solamente una o dos veces al da, y algunos maman pocas                 veces en algunos das y muy frecuentemente en otros. Ms                 all del patrn de amamantamiento, el promedio de                 mamadas decrece gradualmente a medida que el bebe crece. La cantidad                 de una o dos mamadas diarias puede continuar por meses, e incluso                 aos, dependiendo del bebe y la mam.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Los bebes mayorcitos maman para reconfortarse, adicionalmente a                 alimentarse. Amamantar obra maravillas cuando el bebe se lastima,                 est triste o enojado (amamantar calma muchos berrinches),                 o enfermo. El amamantamiento tambin es usado por los bebes                 como una forma rpida de retomar contacto con la madre a                 lo largo del da.A veces los bebes mayores de un ao atraviesan fases de                 aumento de las mamadas nocturnas. Las razones ms frecuentes                 para el aumento de las tomas nocturnas incluyen la salida de dientes,                 disminucin de las tomas durante el da a causa de                 la distraccin, avances en el desarrollo y reconexin                 con la madre.Es comn que los nios amamanten ms a menudo                 cuando estn fuera de su casa durante unos das, o                 si suceden otros cambios importantes en sus rutinas tpicas.                 Para un bebe, mamar significa calidez, confort, reafirmacin                 es el hogar fuera del hogar al que tiende a regresar                 cuando otras cosas resultan inciertas o poco familiares. Una vez                 de regreso a casa (o una vez que el nio se haya adaptado                 al cambio, sea este cual fuese), la cantidad de mamadas tiende a                 disminuir nuevamente.Qu posiciones resultan                 mejores para amamantar bebes mayorcitos?Las posiciones dependen de lo que resulta confortable para la mam                 y el beb, y evolucionarn a medida que el bebe crezca.                 Las posiciones (y a menudo tambin la prendida al pezn)                 suelen tornarse bastante informales a medida que pasa el tiempo,                 y en tanto resulte bien para la madre y el bebe, no representan                 un problema. No obstante, algunas veces la madre sufre dolor en                 los pezones o puede sentir los dientes de arriba del bebe. En estos                 casos resulta una buena idea revisar las posiciones y la prendida                 para introducir algunos cambios.AcrobaciasHacia el ao de edad los bebes desarrollan un creativo repertorio                 de posiciones para amamantar. Las acrobacias son tpicas,                 y es comn que los bebes intenten mamar de cabeza, con los                 pies en el aire, parados en un pie, retorcindose y girando,                 y muchas otras cosas. Disfruta las posiciones que se le ocurran                 a tu bebe, s flexible y paciente, pero si las acrobacias                 se convierten en un problema, estas son algunas de las cosas que                 han ayudado a otras madres:Darle tiempo. Las la fase de exhibiciones acrobticas ms intensas suele aparecer cuando el bebe se da cuenta de que puede mamar en muchsimas posiciones diferentes, y, adicionalmente, le resulta divertido probarlas. Despus de cierto tiempo desaparecer la novedad y las acrobacias disminuirn.Dar al bebe algo para que sostenga entre sus manos mientras amamanta (como un juguete pequeo, por ejemplo). Algunas mams usan collares para llevar la atencin del bebe hacia otra cosa que no sean las acrobacias.Hablar o leer un libro al bebe mientras se amamanta. Canciones o jueguitos de manos tambin pueden ayudar.Una advertencia firme. Decir algo como estate quieto en un tono firme. No levantes la voz, ya que esto podra asustar al bebe.Interrumpir la mamada si el bebe contina con las acrobacias. Con una frase del tipo No puedo darte la teta cuando te ests moviendo de esa forma. Vamos a jugar un rato y gastar un poco de energa y despus podemos seguir. Jugar con el bebe durante unos minutos antes de seguir con la mamada.Otra versin de interrumpir la mamada: avisar al bebe que si no se queda quieto la mam no va a darle la teta. E interrumpir si persiste. Avisarle que cuando pueda estar un poco ms quieto mami le dar la teta nuevamente.Amamantar en pblico cuando el bebe es muy movedizo puede resultar un problema. Intenta amamantar antes de salir, y avisa al bebe que tomar nuevamente en cuanto lleguen al auto o a casa, etc. Posponer la mamada funciona mejor si el bebe tiene ms de un ao y medio y no est demasiado cansado. Si el bebe necesita algo y no es capaz de tranquilizarse para una mamada, puedes ofrecerle algn bocado o un traguito de otra bebida en un vaso.Otros consejos en Nursing mannersSi amamanto ms all del ao,                 despus ser ms difcil destetar?A menudo se escucha que Si no lo destetas ahora NUNCA podrs                 hacerlo!. Es comn que algunas madres desteten a sus                 bebes al cumplir el ao (o antes), incluso cuando ni ellas                 ni el bebe quieren realmente destetar, debido a la idea equivocada                 de que las nicas opciones son destetar al ao de                 edad o amamantar hasta los cinco aos!Amamantar ms all del ao NO vuelve imposible,                 ni siquiera ms dificultoso el destete. Si te parece que                 ms adelante querrs iniciar el destete, por cierto                 podrs hacerlo. La edad tiene menos relacin con la                 facilidad para destetar que la que tiene el nivel de desarrollo                 alcanzado por el bebe. Cada nio tiene su propio momento                 en el cual alcanza la madurez necesaria para dejar la teta, este                 rango vara de nio en nio, y est                 entre los dos y cuatro aos (aunque por cierto se encuentran                 nios por fuera de ambos extremos de este rango). Cuando                 la madre inicia el destete, ste ser ms fcil                 cuanto ms cerca est el bebe de autodestetarse.Cmo es el auto-destete?El autodestete sucede cuando un nio no tiene ms                 necesidad de amamantarse para satisfacer sus necesidades nutricionales                 o emocionales. Es relativamente poco frecuente que un bebe de menos                 de 18-24 meses se autodestete a menos que sea estimulado en esa                 direccin (aunque hechos como el embarazo de la madre tambin                 pueden tener influencia en el desarrollo del destete).Un nio que se autodesteta seguramente disminuir                 su amamantamiento muy gradualmente durante un perodo de                 meses, una mamada por vez (si la disminucin es abrupta es                 ms probable que se trate de una huelga de lactancia).                 Muchos nios continuarn con la mamada de la noche,                 de la siesta o la primera de la maana, o una combinacin                 de estas, durante varios meses antes de destetarse. Un nio                 no se desteta antes de poder beber bien de un vaso y obtener la                 gran mayora de su alimento de otras fuentes durante un perodo                 importante.La historia del destete de mi hija es tpica, se destet                 cuando su hermanito cumpli los catorce meses. Antes de que                 l naciera, ella mantena las mamadas de la siesta,                 hora de dormir y primera de la maana, y continu                 con este ritmo despus del nacimiento (excepto por seis u                 ocho semanas de incremento en las mamadas inmediatamente despus                 del nacimiento, tpico de la lactancia en tandem). Abandon                 la siesta (y junto con ella esa mamada) varios meses antes de destetarse.                 Aproximadamente un mes antes del destete comenz a quedarse                 dormida mientras su pap le lea cuentos al acostarse,                 y de ese modo dej la mamada nocturna. Es posible que haya                 acortado la mamada de la maana, pero no en forma significativa.                 Durante los ltimos das de la semana de vacaciones                 con sus primos estuvo demasiado ocupada para amamantar por las maanas.                 Al regreso tom la teta un par de veces, con diferencia de                 una semana, y as termin.Copyright  2000 kellymom.com.

The First Parent,http://kellymom.com/fun/wisdom/first-parent/,"by         Bill Cosby Whenever your kids are out of control, you can take comfort from                 the thought that even Gods omnipotence did not extend to his kids.  After creating heaven and earth, God created Adam and Eve.  And the first thing God said to them was: Dont.  Dont what? Adam asked.  Dont eat the forbidden fruit, said God.  Forbidden fruit? Really? Where is it? Adam and Eve asked, jumping                 up and down excitedly.  Its over there, said God, wondering why he hadnt stopped after                 making the elephants. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. A few minutes later God saw the kids having an apple break and                 he was very angry.  Didnt I tell you not to eat that fruit? the First Parent asked.  Uh huh, Adam replied.  Then why did you do it? God asked exasperatedly.  I dunno, Adam answered.  Gods punishment was that Adam and Eve should have children of                 their own.  Thus the pattern was set and it has never changed. But there is                 a reassurance in this story. If you have persistently and lovingly                 tried to give your children wisdom and they havent taken it, dont                 be so hard on yourself.

Today I left some dishes dirty,          The bed got made around 3:30.          The diapers soaked a little longer,          The odor grew a little stronger.          The crumbs I spilled the day before,          Are staring at me from the floor.          The fingerprints there on the wall,          Will likely be there still next fall.          The dirty streaks on those window panes,          Will still be there next time it rains.          Shame on you, you sit and say,          Just what did you do today?  I nursed a baby till he slept,          I held a toddler while she wept.          I played a game of hide and seek,          I squeezed a toy so it would squeak.          I pulled a wagon, sang a song,          Taught a child right from wrong.          What did I do this whole day through?          Not much that shows, I guess that s true.

Author Unknown  top     of pageChildhood Doesnt WaitI was sitting on a bench          while in a nearby mall,          When I noticed a young mother          with two children who were small.         The youngest one was whining,          Pick me up, I heard him beg          but the mothers face grew angry          as the child clung to her leg.         Dont hang on to me, she shouted          as she pushed his hands away,          I wish Id had the courage          to go up to her and say         The time will come too quickly          when those little arms that tug,          Wont ask for you to hold them          or wont freely give a hug.         The day will sneak up subtly          just as it did with me,          When you cant recall the last time          that your child sat on your knee.         Like those sacred, pre-dawn feedings          when we cherished time alone          Our babies grow and leave behind          those special times weve known.         So when your child comes to you          with a book that you can share,          Or asks that you would tuck him in          and help him say his prayer         When he comes to sit and chat          or would like to take a walk,          Before you answer that you cant          `cause theres no time to talk         Remember what all parents learn          so many times too late,          That years go by too quickly          and that childhood doesnt wait.         Take every opportunity,          if one should slip away          Reach hard to get it back again,          dont wait another day.         I watched that mother walk away          her children followed near,          I hope shell pick them up          before her chances disappear.

First he licks, but slowly you teach him to nurse.          A little later, you laugh at his quizzical look when he tastes     the first rush of milk.          So you keep him next to you all the warm, tender night.          Drinking and growing, drinking and growing,          With no thought of time.  ONE A.M.          Your one-year-old is sleeping on your arm.          No longer tiny, but chubby-legged and strong.          His curly head so heavy on your aching arm          Though Lord knows it should be strong enough after carrying     him all day.          Lets try to move it  oh, oh, no good.          Yes, yes, hungry one, you murmur. Here it is.          You might as well forget the arm and try to doze off again.  TWO A.M.          Can anything beat a two-year-old cutting his molars in the     middle of the night?          You feel as if hes going to tear you to bits.          Nothing seems to work anymore.          Youve given and given until theres nothing left.          Will this long night ever end?  THREE A.M.          Your three-year-old is nursing quietly.          How long has it been? Well, long enough.           You might as well try it  it usually works.          Honey, Mommy wants to go sleepy now. O.K.?          Muttering, O.K., he rolls over and begins to snore.          Gratefully you snuggle down under the covers between two warm     bodies.  FOUR A.M.          Your long-legged four-year-old is tossing and moaning.          Suddenly he cries out in terror, Mommy! Mommy!          Coming up out of a deep sleep, you move towards him.           A nightmare again. Ah, well.          Dont be afraid, sweetheart. Mommys here. Here.          All is quiet.  FIVE A.M.          The sound of your five-year-old giggling softly intrudes on     your sleep.          Whats so funny?          Oh, I was just thinking about when I dranked your milk.          Oh, really? I thought youd forgotten all about that. Anyway,     whats so funny about that?          Nothing. I just feel happy to think about it. . . . . Mommy?          What? Oh. Oh, well. Just this once.  SIX A.M.          Your six-year-old is looking down at you in the half-light     of dawn.          Mommy, Daddy. Its kind of cold in my new room. Can I come     in with you?          Sure, honey.  SEVEN A.M.          The alarm goes off. You are alone in the big bed.          From the bathroom come voices. Your seven-year-old is watching     his dad shave.          You realize with a start that nobody asked for anything all     night long.          Not even a drink of water.          You sigh and wonder why the years go by as fast as hours.          And in your heart youre glad you had those times together.          All through the night.  by Kathy Eickmann top     of pageNote: If no author is given, then the author is unknown.

I think Ill go to bed. She went to the kitchen to make sandwiches for the next days                 lunches, rinsed out the popcorn bowls, took meat out of the freezer                 for supper the following evening, checked the cereal box levels,                 filled the sugar container, put spoons and bowls on the table and                 started the coffee pot for brewing the next morning. She then put some wet clothes into the dryer, put a load of clothes                 into the wash, ironed a shirt and secured a loose button. She picked                 up the newspapers strewn on the floor, picked up the game pieces                 left on the table and put the telephone book back into the drawer.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. She watered the plants, emptied a wastebasket and hung up a towel                 to dry. She yawned and stretched and headed for the bedroom. She                 stopped by the desk and wrote a note to the teacher, counted out                 some cash for the field trip, and pulled a textbook out from hiding                 under the chair. She signed a birthday card for a friend, addressed and stamped                 the envelope and wrote a quick note for the grocery store. She put                 both near her purse. Mom then creamed her face, put on moisturizer,                 brushed and flossed her teeth and trimmed her nails. Hubby called,                 I thought you were going to bed. Im on my way, she said. She put some water into the dogs dish                 and put the cat outside, then made sure the doors were locked. She                 looked in on each of the kids and turned out a bedside lamp, hung                 up a shirt, threw some dirty socks in the hamper, and had a brief                 conversation with the one up still doing homework. In her own room,                 she set the alarm, laid out clothing for the next day, straightened                 up the shoe rack. She added three things to her list of things to do for tomorrow.                 About that time, the hubby turned off the TV and announced to no                 one in particular, Im going to bed.

Will tandem breastfeeding spread germs between my children?,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/15germworries/,"No special measures are normally needed as far as hygiene and the                 sharing of the breasts. Normal baths and showers will suffice. There                 is no reason to clean the nipple area between children and, as always                 during lactation, use of soap on the nipple is not recommended except                 under special                 circumstances.In general, even if one child becomes sick, there is no reason                 to take any special precautions. Lots of hand washing is more important                 for limiting the spread of infection, and the anti-infection properties                 of breastmilk will also help to prevent the spread of illness. An exception to this is thrush  if anyone involved in the nursing relationship gets thrush, it                 is important that everyone be treated to prevent reinfection. One                 source suggests that assigning each child a separate breast might                 also help to prevent the child without thrush from becoming infected.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.By the time symptoms occur in a viral illness, the two nurslings                 will have been in close contact for days (both in the home and at                 the breast), and thus the well child will have already been exposed                 to the illness. In addition, your breasts will have already started                 to produce antibodies specifically for that illness. These antibodies                 will help the sick child get well quicker and will also help protect                 your other child from illness. There is some speculation that tandem nursing actually hastens                 the process of antibody production in breastmilk. The breast starts                 making antibodies soon after exposure to the illness via your childs                 breastfeeding. If an older child who is not nursing gets                 sick, the breast will not start making antibodies until mom picks                 up the virus independently or from babys mouth (if baby gets sick)                  tandem nursing cuts out the middleman in this process. Washing                 the breasts between nurslings might even reduce the breasts exposure                 to the pathogens and therefore reduce the breasts efficiency at                 manufacturing antibodies.FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Of course if early pregnancy nausea                 has dampened your appetite, and especially if vomiting occurs frequently,                 it is common to gain weight slowly or even lose weight during the                 first trimester. But when some of the calories you do keep down                 are going to make milk, it is natural to wonder if perhaps you would                 be better off conserving those calories by breastfeeding less or                 weaning completely. You will do well to avoid feelings of guilt about your limited                 resources being divided between the placenta and breast milk; but                 instead give careful consideration to just what is in the best interest                 of the three of you. Some mothers have continued breastfeeding,                 counting on a rebound after the nausea subsides in mid-pregnancy,                 and sometimes counting also on fat reserves they had going into                 pregnancy. Others feel that weaning or reductions in nursing are                 necessary to adequately care for the fetus.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.As you evaluate your situation you will want to take into account:                 your rate of weight loss, your total weight loss so far, your number                 of weeks gestation, your fat reserves going into pregnancy, your                 weight-gain pattern last pregnancy, and how much milk you are producing.                 Your caregiver can help you evaluate what is called for in your                 situation, whether it is weaning, a dietary adjustment, a new way                 to work with nausea, or simply abiding with patience. Several studies corroborate the generally held belief that second                 and third trimester weight gains are believed to have the most impact                 on fetal growth. Twenty weeks is often considered a time by which                 the mother should be gaining well, about one pound (0.4 kg) per                 week. from Chapter 13: Eating for Three Read other                 excerpts from this bookExcerpted with permission fromAdventures in Tandem Nursing:           Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyond        by Hilary FlowerLa Leche League International,     LLLI 2003        ISBN: 0912500972FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Pregnancy Complications while Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/tandem-faq/01preg_complications/,"Excerpted with permission fromAdventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyondby Hilary FlowerLa Leche League International,     LLLI 2003ISBN: 0912500972When the pregnancy is complicated decisions become more complicated,                 too. When faced with weight loss, unexplained bleeding, threatened                 preterm labor or twin pregnancies, the mothers who contributed to                 this book have made a variety of different choices including: immediate                 weaning, initiation of gradual weaning, taking a wait and                 see approach, reducing nursing to a lower level in order                 to continue, and nursing on. Its a heart-wrenching position                 to be in. One mother said she felt as though she was forced to choose                 between the baby at her breast and the baby in her womb. It takes                 courage to make these decisions and mothers deserve support for                 this unenviable responsibility. How do you make the best decision? Remember that weaning will not                 guarantee that the pregnancy will be saved, nor will continuing                 to breastfeed necessarily result in the loss of the fetus. Ultimately                 a mother must make the decision that best fits her situation as                 she understands it.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Sometimes, the answer is weaningI had been having considerable trouble with morning sickness and had lost a total of 18 pounds by my 12th week. My obstetrician recommended weaning and I thought it would be best, too. I did it very gradually, and my goal was to have her weaned by mid-pregnancy. I am now 20 weeks pregnant with our little boy and Nina is completely weaned. I have now started to slowly gain weight and I feel the baby kicking. It is an exciting time and I feel so blessed to be a part of all this life force. Maria, Texasand sometimes the answer is to stay the course.When I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I was shocked. My son was almost 9 months old and I was not willing to wean him, even though that is what everyone, including my obstetrician, had insisted on. I was told that I should wean because of all of the problems that I had had with my first pregnancy, including bleeding for about 1 month beginning at my 16th to 17th week of pregnancy and being on medication for preterm labor for the last two months of my pregnancy. I was sure my son still needed the sucking and the comfort of breastfeeding, but was not willing to start him on a bottle or a pacifier. I finally found a doctor who would support my decision to continue to breastfeed during my entire pregnancy. It was a great way to be able to sit and relax while I was pregnant, and it entertained my son while I got the extra rest I needed. My doctor and I did have a plan. He was very comfortable with my situation and felt that nursing a child rarely causes labor, although he said it was possible. We decided that I would immediately wean my son if I started to have problems with preterm labor early on in the pregnancy. Although nursing was very important to me, I decided that it would not be worth the chance of losing a baby if it came to that. I had no problems with my pregnancy despite all of my familys concerns about the new baby getting what it needed to be healthy. Nine months later I delivered an 8lb.11oz.baby girl. She was perfect. Misty, IllinoisSometimes weaning occurs regardless of the mothers intentions.                 Sometimes hospitalization for complications leads to the childs                 self-weaning. Mothers who are worried about a future prospect of                 abrupt weaning for medical reasons also sometimes begin gradual                 weaning in early pregnancy. If weaning is medically necessary, an                 understanding care provider should be able to help you evaluate                 whether it must be immediate or if a specific transitional period                 can be worked out. In cases where immediate weaning is required,                 you may benefit from contacting a local La Leche League Leader or                 an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) to                 help you find ways to make it as painless as possible. from Chapter 12: Health ConcernsRead other                 excerpts from this bookExcerpted with permission fromAdventures in Tandem Nursing: Breastfeeding During Pregnancy and Beyondby Hilary FlowerLa Leche League International,     LLLI 2003ISBN: 0912500972FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Häufig gestellte Fragen zum Tandemstillen: Wie wirkt sich das Stillen auf die Schwangerschaftsübelkeit aus?,http://kellymom.com/translation-german-tandem-faq/d18morningsickness/,"Hier gibt es gute und schlechte Nachrichten. Zuerst ist festzuhalten,                 dass bei einigen Mttern durch eine Stillsitzung sehr heftige                 belkeit ausgelst werden kann. Insbesondere der Milcheinschuss                 kann belkeitsgefhle auslsen. Andererseits verspren                 viele Mtter insgesamt weniger belkeit, wenn sie stillen.                 Es gibt sogar Berichte von Mttern, die besagen, dass nach                 dem Abstillen die belkeit ihren Hhepunkt erreichte.                 (Verringert das Stillen tatschlich die Schwangerschaftsbelkeit?                 Es sieht so aus  aber eine klare Antwort kann nur eine entsprechende                 Studie geben.) Die Betreuung Ihres Kindes kann eine berwltigende                 Aufgabe sein, wenn Sie unter bel- und Mdigkeit leiden.

There is No Doctrine for Attachment Parenting: Being AP is a Frame of Mind!,http://kellymom.com/parenting/ap-frame-of-mind/,"by Diana West, IBCLCReprinted with permission from the author.Since the beginning of civilized time, parents have been drawn together by the common bonds of parenting philosophies, forming communities of mutual support and information based upon those principles. The evolution of Internet bulletin boards and email lists has expanded our interaction capabilities exponentially, nearly eliminating the previous geographical limitations of parenting communities. Now parents from all countries and cultures are able to participate in parenting discussions, and many have found that they naturally gravitate to the large online parenting community bound together by the concept of Attachment Parenting (AP).Some of the earliest posts to the AP online community have been from parents who question and berate themselves for not adhering to what they perceive to be the practicing requirements of AP. Depending upon the mood of the discussion, these might be the use of slings, extended breastfeeding, co-sleeping, or perhaps the avoidance of strollers, cribs, playpens, vaccinations, circumcisions, television, synthetic fabrics, allopathic medicine, disposable diapers, plastic toys, pacifiers, or bottles. Each time a parent questions whether she is truly an AP parent because they have chosen not to follow one or another of these methods, it is a heartbreaking blow to the essential self-assurance that all parents deserve. The fact that there seem to be earmarks of Attachment Parenting makes so many of us think that if we do not practice all the correct AP methods, then we cannot call ourselves an AP parent. I heartily disagree. I believe that being AP is a frame of mind.An Attachment Parent is not one because of the type of carrier she uses to transport or maintain proximity with her kids. She may not have the physical ability to carry a child beyond his first six months. She may not have ever learned the knack of using a sling and may instead prefer a Snugli. Or perhaps she has more than one child, or very spirited children, who are more practically conveyed in a stroller.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.An Attachment Parent is not one because of the way that she feeds her child. She may have had a breast reduction and lack the capability to produce a full milk supply. She may have to supplement, but the supplement you see in that bottle may not be formula. Perhaps its donated breastmilk. Certainly it would be better if she didnt use a bottle, but sometimes, especially outside of the home, that is a much more practical feeding method when supplementation is necessary. It may be that she is bound by a very observant religious culture that prohibits revealing portions of the body, and so in public she may feed her child expressed milk in a bottle.An Attachment Parent is not one because she and her children sleep together in a family bed. Some children (and some adults) simply do not sleep well next to another person. Even some infants fret and are restless when another body infringes upon their space. These kids are highly sensitive to touch and are easily overloaded. A perceptive mother, such as an AP mother, will understand this about her child and allow him his space, while still maintaining proximity.An Attachment Parent is not one because she stays home with her children. There are many family circumstances that absolutely require the mother to work outside the home so that her family can have even the most basic of necessities. Even though these families may not appear to have financial difficulties, we can never assume that they dont, because we cant know all of their pressures and obligations.An Attachment Parent is not one because she does do all of these things. These practices certainly foster attachment, but they are easily circumvented when a parent simultaneously treats her child with disrespect and emotional threats.An AP parent is defined by how she interacts with her child. Does she make a long-term commitment to spending as much time with her children as she possibly can? Does she include her children in every appropriate aspect of her life? Are her children an integral part of her life, rather than an inconvenience that must be quickly taught to comply? Does she respect the individuality, feelings, and thoughts of her children? Is she in tune with her childrens needs and does she seek to meet those needs as a primary priority? Does she interact with her children in such a way that an ever-deepening bond is developed, rather than polarizing the respective positions of power between her and the children? Does she seek to be an emotional coach or is she a policeman?An AP parent is one who wholeheartedly believes that children are inherently good and that by fostering an atmosphere of complete trust and intimacy, a bond is created that provides those children with the foundation and security to become their best selves. It really has little to do with the tools we use to be Attachment parents. All that is important to qualify us to be an Attachment Parent is simply that we parent from an Attachment Parenting frame of mind.Copyright  1999 by Diana West.

Infant Potty Training and Attachment Parenting,http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/infantpottytraining/,"by Laurie BouckeCopyright  2003. Used with permission.Infant potty training is about a gentle, natural and loving method of communication and toilet learning. In most societies where Attachment Parenting has been practiced for centuries, this method of infant toileting is used. Because of this, I consider it to be another element of AP and refer to it as the sixth Baby B  after Dr. Sears 5 Baby Bs:Breastfeeding (Sears)Bonding (Sears)Babywearing (Sears)Bed-sharing (Sears)Belief in Babys Cries (Sears)Bladder/Bowel Communication & Learning (Boucke)In many parts of Asia and Africa, mothers start pottying babies around 1-3 months old and finish before their babies walk. At that time, babies still need some assistance since they cant dress or walk. Mothers read and respond to their babys signals  such as elimination body language, timing, patterns (in relation to feeding and waking) and vocalizations  and in this way, their babies stay clean and dry. Many mothers also rely on intuition. The reason this is possible is that there is a window of learning (sensitive period) open from birth until the age of 5-6 months.On the medical front, recent European research has found that the current Western views on bladder and bowel control are flawed and that it is often better to start earlier than to delay. Unfortunately, the Western world has been indoctrinated to reject any form of early toilet learning. Even when our own parents or grandparents tell us that they had all of their children potty trained by 12-18 months, we assume they are mistaken. Our doubts stem from medlore  maturational readiness theories which are based on opinion and commercialism rather than scientific proof. By changing our attitude from skepticism to recognizing our babies amazing abilities, we open new doors.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I refer to this method as infant potty training (IPT) or infant pottying. Other terms include elimination communication, trickle treat (the title of my first book on this topic, now out of print) and natural infant hygiene.A normal, healthy infant is aware of the bodily function of elimination and can learn to respond to it from infancy. By using diapers, we condition and thereby train baby to go in them. Later the child must unlearn this training. This can be confusing and a traumatic experience for the child.An infant does his best to communicate his awareness to you, but if you dont listen, he will stop communicating and gradually lose touch with the elimination functions. He will be conditioned not to care and learn that you want him to use his diaper as a toilet.One of the most common questions Im asked is, Is it too late to start if my baby is older than 5-6 months? In one sense, it is never too late to start, but you will probably need to used a modified version of IPT for babies over 6 months. Many parents have started at 6, 9, even 12 months and have done okay by making some modifications. It is usually harder to start with a mobile baby who has been trained to go in a diaper or who wears disposables and does not associate the feeling of wetness with elimination. If this method resonates, if you feel it is right for you and your baby, and if your healthy baby takes to it, it is certainly worth an honest try! As long as there are no major upsets in your family life or health, you are likely to be open and receptive to your babys elimination communication.Another factor to consider is that there is not a fixed cutoff age at which babies lose their connection with the elimination functions. Each child is unique and develops in his own manner. There are parents who have learned about IPT or who have started other methods of toilet learning when their babies were 6-18 months, 2 years or even older, and who have been delighted to find that their little ones were ready, receptive and communicative about toileting at these ages. In short, the window of learning seems to remain open or accessible for some older babies. No matter what age your baby is when you first learn about IPT, I usually recommend that parents give this gentle and nurturing method a try for a few weeks, then assess whether you want to continue.More informationSee also Links: Diaper-free babies @ If you have questions after reading this article, you can reach me at infantpotty@hotmail.comBooksIf you want to know more, these are my two books on the topic:Infant Potty Training: A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living by Laurie Boucke (500 pages)Infant Potty Basics: With or Without Diapers The Natural Way by Laurie Boucke (110 pages).I found your book to be very helpful.

Reflections…,http://kellymom.com/parenting/reflections/,"by Paula                 YountMother-to-Mother.comReprinted                 with permission from the author. The last fading beams of sunlight filter in through the window                 as I sit here holding the tiny body of my first grandchild. The                 warmth of her body envelopes mine, and I cuddle her close to my                 chest, her ear pressed against my breast, the beating of my heart                 a soft and gentle reassuring song playing to her in the land of                 dreams. Memories dance across my mind of her mother, a tiny newborn, a                 toothless grin, wobbly first steps, her joy at riding her first                 bicycle, her first hockey game, teaching her to drive, her first                 broken heart, her first dance, her first date, the midnight hour                 she burst into the room to share her engagement, seeing her in her                 wedding dress, watching her take the hand of her new husband, and                 driving away to her new home. Seems like it was only yesterday she                 confided she might be expecting, then the months rolled by as I                 watched this tiny miracle grow, and then emerge into the world,                 a tiny mirror image of her mother. I caress the tiny hand that lay gently cupped around my own, feeling                 the softness of her skin, the dimpled knuckles, the tiny fingers.                 I revel in this magical moment, the emotion so strong I have to                 swallow back the lump that has grown in my throat. I blink back                 tears as I think of how proud I am of my daughter. Of the kind of                 mother she is, of the strength she has to listen to her instincts                 and ignore the advice of others or the ridicule for being such an                 attached parent. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I am thankful that my granddaughter is held in loving arms, even                 at 3 am, that she is rocked, and cuddled and snuggled. That she                 is nursed when she indicates the need, regardless of how long its                 been since the last time, that she is never left alone to cry. My heart swells with pride for my daughter, this woman, this mother                  that she is committed every hour of every day, to the needs of                 this tiny child, that she faces the world bravely and fights for                 what she believes in.My heart aches for the young mothers out there who strive for these                 very same things, with little or no support, little or no praise,                 little or no encouragement. They are hit at every turn with expert                 advice on feeding, on sleeping, on nurturing their babies, on when                 to wean  advice that goes against every fiber of her being. They                 are told that breastfeeding is not that important, they are told                 that unless they teach the baby whos boss they will never have                 a moments peace, that their child will be a monster  they are                 told to ignore the heartbreaking cries of their babies who just                 seek the comfort of mothers arms in the dark of night, to drift                 off to sleep within the security of her love. My heart aches for the baby left alone to learn to self-comfort,                 to cry it out. Experts have told moms not spoil their babies                 and to let them cry. This is a good thing? What are we accomplishing?                 Babies need nurturing and it is not spoiling them to provide it.                 Spoiling means ruining and you cannot ruin a child with love and                 affection. We are made to respond, to nurture. Call it instinct, call                 it intuition, call it being tuned in, call it natural  it                 is the core of the relationship between mother and child a bond.                 If you steel yourself against your babys cries, you damage the                 core, you begin to lose the instinct, youre not tuned in to                 your babys needs as easily, or as quickly, and eventually you                 break that bond. You stop responding. The very life-force of the                 connection between mother and baby is being suppressed, and occasionally,                 snuffed out. We are told it works because the baby stops crying. But what                 has worked? Has baby really learned to comfort himself; or he has                 only learned that he might as well give up, that he will not be                 responded to. Is this a good thing? In the 1970s Dr. T. Berry Brazelton studied newborns to see whether                 they could feel hopeless or depressed. In the following quote from                 Suzanne Arms book Immaculate Deception II, page 186, Arms                 tells of a study that Dr. Brazelton did in which he videotaped babies                 crying in order to get the attention of their moms: In a heartrending series of videotaped sessions, each baby can                 be seen crying to elicit a response from its mother and, failing                 to do so, working even harder. After a number a minutes of making                 all kinds of faces and trying to make eye contact, each baby finally                 reaches its level of tolerance and begins to look away from the                 mother, finding it too difficult to continue making an effort with                 no response. The baby eventually turns its face away from its mothers                 face. Then it turns toward the mother again and tries to rouse a                 response. Each time it turns away for longer and longer periods.                 Finally, each baby slumps down, drops its head, and shows all the                 signs of hopelessness. I remember seeing these segments on TV, and what an impact the                 end result had on me. I wish every new mother could see these. Perhaps                 it would make a difference for those who are feeling pressured to                 parent in a way that goes against what lies in their hearts. Perhaps                 it would give them the courage they need to stay the course, to                 hang in there, even when things seem to be the most difficult, and                 most of all to respond. I wish every mother could know how important she is, and that the                 sleepless nights, the pain and difficulties she might encounter                 now, with babies and later with teens  are all part of the gift                 of mothering. For without this, how can we give true measure to                 the beauty and importance of being a mother? The last fading beams of sunlight filter in through the window                 as I sit here holding the tiny body of my first grandchild. The                 warmth of her body envelopes mine, and I cuddle her close to my                 chest, her ear pressed against my breast, the beating of my heart                 a soft and gentle reassuring song, playing to her in the land of                 dreams. Arguments for and against may come and go but I am                 glad that I am an attached grandparent.Copyright                  2002 by Paula                 Yount.

Building Your Child’s Self-Esteem,http://kellymom.com/parenting/self-esteem-holinger/,"By Paul C. Holinger, M.D., M.P.H., author of What                 Babies Say Before They Can TalkWhen a baby finds that her signals     are validated and responded to appropriatelythat troubles     are soothed and pleasure enhancedshe begins to sense     that her feelings, expressions, of her very being, are of     value and important. A baby learns that she counts for something.     This is the foundation of the development of self-esteema     combination of who you are, how you feel about yourself, and     what you think about your future potential.Self-esteem takes root or withers depending on how you handle     your childs signals of funinterest and enjoymentand     validating and attending to the signals for helpdistress,     anger, fear, shame, disgust, and dissmell.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.As parents you are the most important people in your babys     world. You provide your child with his first definitions of     himself. You tell him through your every word, gesture, and     action just how important he is and how he is perceived by     the outside world.Over the coming months and years, as your child matures and     becomes an adult, his self-esteem will become a more complex     web of interlocking emotions and thoughts about himself and     about how he sees and is seen by others. Its common     for growing children and as well as adults to fluctuate between     episodes of high and low self-esteem over the course of months     or years. However, a solid foundation of self-esteembuilt     by appropriate responses to a childs signals and nurtured     throughout childhoodwill help most people maintain     a basically optimistic view of their lives and their future     over the course of lifes ups and downs.Your goal now, with your baby, is to help him develop a sense     of himself that is reasonably solid and stable. As he grows,     that will allow him to perceive his talents and abilities     accurately, respond to life with flexibility, and look at     his goals and capacities realistically.Of course, the real key is loving the very essence of your     childloving and valuing the child for himself or herself,     who he or she is. But this is often easier said than doneespecially     if the parents have not been loved and valued. Yet, understanding     the nine signals can be useful here too: Much of the childs     essence is wrapped up in her interests and enjoyments; and     understanding and attending to the negative signals can help     prevent the cycles of frustration, hurt, and anger which can     so contaminate the parent-child relationship and erode the     childs internal world.The Foundation of Self-EsteemFrom the first days of your babys life, you can lay     the foundation for self-esteem by responding appropriately     to your childs signals for help (distress, anger, etc.)     and fun (interest and enjoyment).Many experts believe that another important building block     of self-esteem involves a childs experience of competence.     Competence is initially achieved as a result of the brains     capacity to create order out of the disorder of all the incoming     stimuli. An infants inherent ability to develop competence     lays the foundation for later, more sophisticated mastery     of interaction with the world and people, which in turn may     produce a sense of self-esteem. One part of this development,     as a child grows, is learning that he is able to exert control     over external events. Another, as he interacts with his environment,     is learning how to adapt in a healthy way to the external     worlds social requirements and expectations.How to Help Your Child Build Self-EsteemFocusing Appropriate Attention on the Child. Babies thrive when they feel they are of genuine interest     to you and are the center of your universe. They use their     nine signals to express their entire range of emotions. When     a baby cries, or fusses, or coos, she expects you to react     with as much enthusiasm or distress as she does about what     is happening to her.What parents sometimes forget is that to babies those reactions     of distress are proportional to the situation. Not being able     to get a hold of a ball that rolled into a corner is terrible!     And your baby wants you to pay attention to him when he announces     it in no uncertain terms. He finds himself incapable of righting     the situation himselfno matter what he does, hell     never be able to reach the ball. Talk about frustration! So     he asks for your help in the only way he canby making     a scene. If that doesnt elicit your sympathy and attention,     if you dont respond and help your baby out of his distress,     he will begin to think that his problems dont really     matter, how he feels doesnt count. Instead, if you     take the opportunity to pay attention, validating and confirming     his feelings and perceptions, you will help your child become     confident. Provide Reward and Praise. Along with paying     attention, reward and praise from you are essential to childs     self-esteem. You must never forget how much your child wants     to be like you and to be liked by you. Kids need to hear that     you approve of them and think they are wonderful. They long     to see the gleam in your eye that signals love     and approval. You cant assume they know how you feel.     They dont. They need to be told, over and over and     over. In the long run, reward and praise tend to be better     and healthier motivators than fear and shame. Of course, whenever     youre dealing with behavior, it is also important to     explain to the child the pros and cons, the reasons and rationales,     for whatever issue is at stake.Offer Protection. If a child perceives the     world as threatening or dangerous, it is almost impossible     for her to feel brave and strong, to know that she can make     her way through it successfully. But when you respond to your     childs negative signals of distress and anger by allowing     expression of the signals and then removing the triggers,     you have begun to give her the tools to deal with the world.     When it comes to feeling confident, nothing helps a helpless     baby like knowing she can depend on you to shield her from     danger and distress.How Self-Esteem is DamagedSome parents inadvertently diminish their childrens     self-esteem by interfering with or belittling their signals     for interest and enjoyment. This triggers the automatic, built-in     response of shame, and shame erodes self-esteem.In my clinical practice, I frequently work with families     in which both the parents and children have a variety of troubles     related to a poor sense of self and self-esteem. The adults     in these families often dont understand how feelings     and emotions work. The family ends up in a toxic situation     because there is a mismatch between the childs expression     of emotional needs and the parents ability to respond     appropriately. Often, then, the children fail to develop a     solid sense of selfwho they are, what they like and     dont like, a confidence in their perceptions and feelings,     and so on. The resulting tension that develops between parent     and child can contribute to the erosion of his self-esteem.     The child may become angry, defensive, intolerant, and inflexible,     or withdrawn, self-destructive, envious, and fearful. In fact,     a whole variety of the less pleasing personality traits can     be directly attributed to a persons lack of belief     in his own essential worth. Think bully. Think timid. Think     depressed, depleted, and drained. These different qualities     result, in part, from a lack of self-esteem.The results of these kinds of parenting missteps can be heartbreaking.     But the results of positive parenting are tremendous. You     and your child are able to enjoy one anothers company,     to delight in the deepening of your friendship. You gain access     to the delightfully quirky way the world looks to a child.     You learn as your baby learns. You gain confidence in your     parenting skills; your self-esteem increases. Over time, you     become ever more able to allow your child to grow into a unique,     self-confident being. And because she has a solid sense of     self, she will become capable of forming fulfilling relationships     and of maintaining a healthy autonomy. Copyright  2005 Paul C.

Tips for separation anxiety,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/separationanxiety/,"by Paula                 Yount Mother-to-Mother.comReprinted                 with permission from the author. Here are some ideas that may help make things go smoother when                 baby is going through a separation anxiety stage: Be calm and consistent.It helps to create a good-bye ritual  give hugs & kisses and then say good-bye  and GO. Dont come back (it makes it worse for baby and you) just go.Separation/return games, and short practice separations are quite helpful. If baby is not comfy with Dad or another caregiver just yet, try playing games with baby, like peek-a-boo and Wheres the baby?You can play peek-a-boo with babys feet: With the baby lying on his back, lift his legs so babys feet hide your face (body is in an L shape), and then say,  Peek-a-boo! as you open the legs wide & peek through the babys feet. Most babies catch on to this really quickly and love to open their legs themselves to find you.When you play Wheres the Baby?(or Wheres [babys name]?), you drop a lightweight cloth (receiving blanket, hand towel, cloth diaper, etc.) over your babys head, ask, Wheres the baby? and pull the cloth away, grinning and saying, There you are!    This is a game most babies LOVE! They usually have a blast pulling the cloth off and laughing. You can put the cloth over your own head, too. Taking the game one step further, you can partially hide behind a chair or around a corner where you will be easily discovered. To incorporate Dad, take the baby and say Wheres Daddy? and he can peek out, or you can sneak to find him. Then as baby relaxes and enjoys the game (knows whats coming), DAD can take baby and find you. Then later, when you have to go, have Dad play this game with baby one on one. You can also incorporate hiding and finding toys. You can use practice separations. Tell your baby that you will be going to another room and that you will be right back (even though  baby will not understand the words yet); i.e. Mommys got to potty be right back. Then have Dad stand outside the bathroom door and play Wheres Mommy? They can also call Mom Moooommmmmyyyy? ( soft and gentle question) and then Wheres Mommy? I hear Mommy! and then YOU talk to baby through the bathroom door. Once you open the door, you can say something like Hello! or There she is!. (Note: Bye-bye is one of the first words most babies learn. It can be good to teach them Hello too!)Prior to returning to work, practice being apart from each other, and introduce new people and places gradually. If youre planning to leave your child with a relative or a new babysitter, then invite that person over in advance so baby can get to know that person and feel comfortable. Its also good to have a week of dry run (two, if possible), where you start out with 1/3 day (a couple hours) then a half day, then, when its time, the full day. This gives baby and you time to adjust and also to work out any kinks that may arise.If Dad is going to be the caregiver, have him take over some of the care of  baby beforehand: bathing, reading a story while you hold baby on your lap (you want to make it a gentle, gradual transition when possible), or going for walks in the stroller. If you go to the mall, give Dad the stroller with baby, and practice walks and brief separations from Mom (i.e. go behind clothes and play peek a boo a few times). Have Dad put baby in the high chair and offer snacks, a cup of water, etc. As Dad gets more hands on with baby, baby will accept that hes okay to offer care while you are gone.For brief dates out with Dad, have Grandma or another friend or relative come over for several days in a row for a couple hours, or take baby there to visit, so baby knows this person ( they are not a complete stranger to baby). Do short runs first (i.e. 30 min or so), then graduate to a longer time away. Breastfeed JUST before leaving, kiss baby and go. Things WILL be okay.Babys favorite items, blankets or stuffed animals, can help baby feel more secure, too.Keep in mind that separations are harder on your baby if he is tired, hungry, or sick. Whenever possible, try to time separations when your baby is happy, awake/alert, and healthy.FacebookPinterestTwitter"
"Slings, wraps & other baby carriers — Why, How & Where?",http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/sling/,"Advantages of wearing your babyFinding a baby carrier that is right for youMy sling experiencesHave a baby carrier, but not sure how to use it?Links: Related articlesLinks: Sling/carrier reviews and comparisonsLinks: Make your own baby carrier Links: Babywearing instructionsUsing a baby carrier can make life easier for you and is good for your baby. Following are some of the advantages of wearing your baby (from  The Baby Book by William and Martha Sears):Its convenient. You can breastfeed discretely in most baby carriers while working, getting things done around the house, shopping or eating in a restaurant. If you have a baby who wants to be held all the time, this is an easy way to meet her needs while doing other things.It helps moms care for older siblings. Carrying your baby in a carrer can give you the mobility to care for your older children.It helps some babies to breastfeed better. Some babies, particularly those who are tense or tend to arch their backs, breastfeed better while moving. Also, babies who are slow to gain weight (for no apparent reason) have been known to gain better if carried in a carrier for several hours a day, since proximity to mom encourages babies to eat more frequently.It reduces crying and colic. A 1986 study of 99 mother-infant pairs (reported in Pediatrics) showed that carrying babies at least three hours a day reduces crying and fussing 43% during the day and 51% at night. Babies are happier because they have less need to cry, and parents enjoy their babies more as a result.It enhances learning. Carried babies have enhanced visual and auditory alertness, and increased quiet alertness times. Carrying a baby promotes cognitive development and speech development, since babies are exposed to more experiences and conversations.Carried babies are involved in their parents world. They participate in life, rather than see it as a spectator.Carrying your baby promotes bonding and enhances parents feelings of competence. A higher frequency of feeding and touching stimulates mothering hormones, and frequent carrying encourages and speeds the development of a mutual reading of each others cues.Finding a carrier that is right for youThere are many types of baby carriers. These include adjustable slings with rings (these come padded or unpadded), pouch slings that are not adjustable, asian-style carriers, and wraps that simply tie on.Look at photos of the different types, and, if possible, try on several different types, brands and sizes of baby carrier to see which suits you best.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Have a baby carrier, but not sure how to use it?There are many different positions for baby in slings, wraps and other baby carriers  lying down in the cradle hold is NOT the only option: baby can sit up and face the front, sit up and face you, lie down, sit on your hip, or even ride on your back.Many areas have baby wearing support groups, where you can learn to use different carriers and even borrow carriers to try out. Breastfeeding support groups (La Leche League, Breastfeeding USA, etc.) can also be a good place to try out a carrier & find out how to use one, since many breastfeeding moms use baby carriers.See below for additional how-to resources.My sling experiences(This was written when my son was one! I carried him in a sling for over 3 years.)I love my sling. Ive been using one for the last four years (since my daughter was 6 months old), and Ive collected several different ones over the years. My son is now one and has been carried in a sling since he was a day old. My daughter rode in the sling until she was three and I was too pregnant to wear it. We dont go anywhere without the sling. My daughter hated strollers & shopping carts, and I soon found out that its much easier to maneuver with a sling than a stroller. I now save the stroller for when I need something for carrying things other than the baby (packages, lunch, etc.), or when well be gone all day (like an amusement park). Both of my children have liked to sleep & nurse while Im shopping. With my daughter, I started out with a front carrier (which I liked in the beginning), but by the time she was 6 months it was hurting my back and was very hot (summer in central Florida  yuck).My sling is much cooler than the front pack, doesnt give me a backache, and I can nurse in it. My toddler can still ride in it (unlike a front carrier) and there are many different positions for carrying a baby/child. I personally know a couple of people who used a sling until their child was 35-40 pounds. You can also use it for a changing pad, a blanket, or for playing peek-a-boo (and lots of other things). We go to Busch Gardens pretty often, and I carry my (22 pound) son in it for 3-4 hours at a time.When my youngest child was born, I discovered wraps and soft structured carriers (good ones are so much easier to find than when my older kids were little!). Im a great fan of stretchy wraps for younger babies, and a good soft structured carrier is great for older babies and toddlers. I still carry (and breastfeed) my youngest (at 3 years old & 28 lbs) in a soft structured carrier pretty frequently.Related articlesThe Mamatoto Project has tons of great info on babywearingBabywearing from AskDrSears.comWill I Spoil My Baby If I Carry Her in a Sling? by Dr. William SearsBabywearing Made Simple by Rachel BartlettBaby Wearing: Constant Contact by Jennifer VanLaanen-SmitCuddle Up!

Wakeful 4 Month Olds,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/4mo-sleep/,"by Jan Barger, RN, MA, IBCLC, FILCA.Reprinted with permission from the author.Image courtesy of tostadophoto.com / CC BY-2.0 flickr.comOne concern about some parenting books and pediatricians/ health care professionals (HCP) who give advice about sleeping infants is this: Baby starts sleeping through the night at, say, about 3 months  or is sleeping 5 to 6 hours instead of 2 to 3. Suddenly around 4 months, little Buford starts waking up at night to nurse. Mom is understandably distressed. Some books say its a bad habit that must be stopped. Her HCP says essentially the same thing. Someone else points out that since the baby slept through the night at 3 months, it is OBVIOUS that the baby CAN sleep and doesnt need to breastfeed. The book goes on to talk about how the baby is now manipulating the mother. The pediatrician says hes big enough to go without eating at night. Grandma tells her to let Buford cry it out. So does the book. There may be different ways of stating it, but in essence, dont pick him up and feed him.Has NO ONE stopped to consider the developmental stage of the breastfeeding baby that begins at about four months and can go on to 6 or 7 months? Think about your four month old breastfeeding  what is he doing? This baby is on and off the breast  so interested in the world around him he can hardly stand it. Oh look! Theres the dog! Hi, Mommy, I love you SOOOO much! The phone?! A car went by. The TV is on. Big sister comes into the room.hey, theres just too much going on for me to concentrate on eating. I think Im full now. Ill see you later..When I get one of these babies in my office, I have to observe the feed without saying a word to the mother. The entire feeding is done in complete silence so that the baby will EAT and not look around at me. How many times have you been told to go into a darkened, quiet room to get a good feeding? OK, now think about night time. Buford is really hungry  he didnt eat well during the day. Nighttime is here; its dark, quiet, and he has mommys undivided attention. So he has a really great meal. Doesnt take long  hes pretty efficient by now. He gets down to business and completes the feed in short order.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.But WAIT! Someone told the mother that the baby cant possibly be hungry  just let her cry it out. Now moms milk supply diminishes because the baby isnt eating well during the day  too many things going on, and shes going through some new developmental stages (when Hildegarde is learning something new, she doesnt nurse as well until the new skill is mastered), and she isnt nursing at night either. Now mom is going to have to work at bringing her supply back up again by adding pumping/hand expression to the mix.Why dont bottle feeding babies wake up as much at 4 months? Because by this time, mom has often handed the bottle off to baby to feed himself, and/or seats him looking out so he can check out the dog, the phone, the sibling, etc  and continue eating at the same time.Please dont deny that your breastfeeding baby is quite possibly very hungry at night at four months, even though they may have been sleeping through the night prior to this. Look at the feed  can you hear swallowing? Does your breast get softer? Is he EATING? Then dont make him cry it out! He needs to eat.and he needs his mommy.Copyright  by Jan Barger, RN, MA, IBCLC, FILCALactation Education ConsultantsNo portion of this text may be copied or reproduced in any manner, electronically or otherwise, without the express written permission of the author (IBCLC@aol.com).Jan Barger is a mom of three, and proud Grammie of three and one due in 2017.

Co-sleeping and Bed-sharing,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/cosleeping/,"What is co-sleeping?Co-sleeping essentially means sleeping in close proximity to your child. It may be in the same bed or just in the same room. Some ways of co-sleeping that different families use are:Bed-sharing/Family Bed:Parent(s) sleep in the same bed with the child.Sidecar arrangement: Securely attach a crib to one side of the parents bed, next to the mother. Three sides of the babys crib are left intact, but the side next to the parents bed is lowered or removed so that mother and baby have easy access to one another. Commercial cosleeper/sidecar cribs are also available.Different beds in the same room:This might include having babys bassinet or crib within arm reach of the parents (easier at night) or just in the same room; or preparing a pallet or bed for an older child on the floor next to, or at the foot of, the parents bed.Child welcomed into parents bed as needed:The baby/child has her own bedroom, but is welcomed into the parents bed at any time. In many families, children start their overnight hours in a separate bed or room, but are welcomed into the parents bed after a night waking.Advantages of co-sleepingCo-sleeping is not the best fit for every family, but it can have many advantages:Parents often get more sleep.Babies often get more sleep. Baby stirs and almost wakes up when she needs to nurse, but since she is right beside mom, mom can breastfeed or soothe her back to sleep before she fully wakes up.Breastfeeding during the night is easier when baby is nearby.Breastfeeding at night helps to maintain your milk supply.Sleeping in the same room as your baby reduces the risk of SIDS by as much as 50% [AAP].Night nursing also tends to prolong the child-spacing effects of breastfeeding.No nighttime separation anxiety.Fewer bedtime hassles.Its lovely to wake up next to a smiling baby!Creating a safe sleep area for your babyAnysleep surface that baby uses (including cribs, nap surfaces, or adult beds) should be made safe for baby:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Baby should be placed on his back to sleep.The sleep surface should be firm. Do not put a baby on a waterbed mattress, pillow, beanbag, sheepskin or any other soft surface to sleep.Bedding should be tight fitting to the mattress.The mattress should be tight fitting to the headboard and footboard (or sides of the crib).There should not be any loose pillows, stuffed animals, or soft blankets near the babys face.There should not be any space between the bed and adjoining wall where the baby could roll and become trapped.Babies (with or without an adult) shouldneversleep on a sofa, couch, futon, recliner, or other surface where baby can slip into a crevice or become wedged against the back of the chair/sofa/etc.Bed-sharing SafetyBed-sharing is just one of the ways that a family might co-sleep, but it is frequently practiced by breastfeeding mothers. One of the biggest issues when it comes to bed-sharing is safety.  Some sources publicize bed-sharing as an unsafe practice, no matter how its done, but there are ways to sleep safely while bed-sharing if you follow guidelines for safe sleep surfaces and safe sleep sharing.According to the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, in their Clinical Protocol #6: Guideline onCo-Sleeping and Breastfeeding:There is currently not enough evidence to support routine recommendations against co-sleeping. Parents should be educated about risks and benefits of co-sleeping and unsafe co-sleeping practices and should be allowed to make their own informed decision.The ISIS Infant Sleep Information Source website notes:The most recent studies have shown that most bed-sharing deaths happen when an adult sleeping with a baby has been smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking drugs (illegal or over-the-counter medicines) that make them sleep deeply.Sometimes people fall asleep with their babies accidentally or without meaning to. This can be very dangerous, especially if it happens on a couch/sofa where a baby can get wedged or trapped between the adult and the cushions.James J. McKenna, Ph.D., a world-recognized infant sleep authority, notes:In sum, overwhelmingly, bedsharing deaths are associated with at least one independent risk factor associated with an infant dying. These include an infant being placed prone (on its stomach) and placed in an adult bed without supervision, or no breastfeeding, or other children in the bed, or infants being placed in an adult bed on top of a pillow, or who bedshare even though their mothers smoked during thepregnancy therein compromising potentially the infants ability to arouse (to terminate too little oxygen, or to terminate an apnea).Drug use and alcohol have historically been associated with poor outcomes for bedsharing babies so if drugs and/or alcohol are present, please dont bedshare.General Safety Guidelines for Bed-sharingIf baby is sharing sleep with another person:Very small premature or low birth-weight babies appear to be at greater risk when bed-sharing, but benefit greatly from co-sleeping nearby but on a separate surface (more).Do not sleep with baby if you are currently a smoker or if you smoked during pregnancy  this greatly increases SIDS risk (more)Do not sleep on the same surface as your baby if you are overly tired or have ingested alcohol/sedatives/drugs (or any substance that makes you less aware) (more).Baby appears to be safest when sleeping beside his/her breastfeeding mother. (More info here for non-breastfeeding parents)Older siblings or other children should not sleep with babies under a year old.Do not swaddle your baby when bed-sharing. Baby may overheat (which is a risk factor for SIDS) and a swaddled baby is not able to effectively move covers from the face or use arms and legs to alert an adult who is too close (more).Other potential hazards: very long hair should be tied up so that it does not become wrapped around babys neck; a parent who is an exceptionally deep sleeper or an extremely obese parent who has a problem feeling exactly how close baby is should consider having baby sleep nearby, but on a separate sleep surface (more).Some authorities specifically recommend co-sleeping without bed-sharing, since they feel that not bed-sharing is the easiest way to eliminate any risks of bed-sharing.For example, theAmerican Academy of Pediatricssays, Room-sharing without bedsharing is recommended There is evidence that this arrangement decreases the risk of SIDS by as much as 50%.Night nursing and ear infections?You might hear that breastfeeding your baby in a lying down position will cause ear infections. Research indicates that this is not true. Also, keep in mind that with most nursing positions, baby is lying down while nursing anyway  whether mom is or not!Can co-sleeping cause psychological problems in my child?People who are uncomfortable with the idea of co-sleeping often suggest that co-sleeping is less healthy than the child sleeping alone and will cause psychological damage to the child, cause baby to become too dependent on the parents, etc. Dr. James McKenna counters these suggestions:In part, this view represents a personal and arbitrary judgment that anyone is entitled to make as long as it is not passed on as scientific fact. Such judgments are based on Western values favoring the perception of how individualism and infant autonomy are best promoted and obtained. No study has shown, however, that the goals for separateness and independence (or happiness, for that matter) are obtained in the individual by, among other things, separate sleeping arrangements for parents and children, nor do any studies demonstrate negative consequences for children or parents who choose to cosleep for ideological or emotional purposes, except when cosleeping is part of a larger psychologically disordered set of family relationships or when cosleeping occurs under dangerous social or physical circumstances. The only studies of the psychological or social effects of cosleeping reveal not negative but positive consequences. One study among military families revealed that cosleeping children receive higher evaluations of their comportment from their teachers than do solitary sleeping children and are under-represented among psychiatric populations, when compared with children who do not cosleep [Forbes JF, Weiss DS: The cosleeping habits of military children. Mil Med 1992; 157:196-200]. Lewis and Janda found that college-age students who coslept as children were better adjusted and more satisfied with their sexual identities and behavior than college-age students who did not cosleep [Lewis RJ, Janda H: The relationship between adult sexual adjustment and childhood experience regarding exposure to nudity, sleeping in the parental bed, and parental attitudes towards sexuality. Arch Sex Behav 1988; 17:349-363] . Clearly, we need to change our conceptualization concerning what constitutes a normal or healthy childhood sleep pattern! From: Stein MT, et al. Cosleeping (Bedsharing) Among Infants and Toddlers. Pediatrics 2001 Apr; 107(4); 873-877Dr. McKenna alsonotes thatIt has never been proven, nor shown, nor is it even probable, that sleeping with your baby has any kind of negative long-term effects when the relationships between those involved are healthy. Instead, experts are finding that cosleeping can help develop positive qualities, such as more comfort with physical affection, more confidence in ones own sexual gender identity, a more positive and optimistic attitude about life, or more innovativeness as a toddler and an increased ability to be alone.See also:What are the long term effects on my baby of sharing a bed?by James McKenna, PhD.More informationCo-sleeping safetySafe Sleep Resources from Platypus MediaWhere Babies Sleep from the ISIS Infant Sleep Information SourceGuidelines to Sleeping Safe with Infantsby James J.

Studies on normal infant sleep,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/sleepstudies/,"Probably one of the                 main reasons that babies who dont sleep through the night are such                 a big issue is that parents dont have realistic expectations of                 the sleep patterns of babies. Babies were designed to wake up often                 at night to feed and cuddle, and keep in mind that many adults wake                 during the night, too. If our expectations for babies were not so                 different from our babies expectations for themselves, much of                 this problem might disappear. Following is information                 on studies that have been done on the typical sleep patterns of                 babies and young children. Harrison   Y. The   relationship between daytime exposure to light and night-time   sleep in 6-12-week-old infants.   J Sleep Res. 2004 Dec;13(4):345-52. Abstract: This project investigated the relationship between                 exposure to light and 24-h patterns of sleep and crying in young,                 healthy, full-term babies living at home and following a normal                 domestic routine. Measures included an ankle worn activity monitor,                 an external light monitor and the Barr Baby Day Diary in which parents                 recorded periods of sleep, crying, feeding and other behaviours                 at 5-min intervals throughout the 24-h period. Fifty-six babies                 (26 males and 30 females) were monitored across three consecutive                 days at 6, 9 and 12 weeks of age. There was an early evening peak                 in crying which was associated with reduced sleep at 6 weeks. Across                 the trials there was a gradual shift towards a greater proportion                 of sleep occurring at night. Sleeping well at 6 weeks was a good                 indication of more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks. Babies who                 slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in                 the early afternoon period. These data suggest that light in the                 normal domestic setting influences the development of the circadian                 system.

Night   waking, sleep-wake organization, and self-soothing in the first   year of life.   J Dev Behav Pediatr 2001 Aug;22(4):226-33 Abstract: Few objective data are available regarding infants                 night waking behaviors and the development of self-soothing during                 the first year of life. This cross-sectional study examined 80 infants                 in one of four age groups (3, 6, 9, or 12 mo) for four nights by                 using videosomnography to code nighttime awakenings and parent-child                 interactions. A large degree of variability was observed in parents                 putting the infant to bed awake or asleep and in responding to vocalizations                 after nighttime awakenings. Most infants woke during the night at                 all ages observed. Younger infants tended to require parental intervention                 at night to return to sleep, whereas older infants exhibited a greater                 proportion of self-soothing after nighttime awakenings. However,                 even in the 12-month-old group, 50% of infants typically required                 parental intervention to get back to sleep after waking. Results                 emphasize the individual and contextual factors that effect the                 development of self-soothing behavior during the first year of life.  Scher A. Attachment   and sleep: a study of night waking in 12-month-old infants. Dev Psychobiol 2001 May;38(4):274-85. Abstract: Sleep regulation was examined from a mother-child                 relational perspective. Although the link between sleep and attachment                 has been previously discussed, empirical support is rather limited.                 This report, which is a part of a longitudinal investigation of                 sleep in infancy, examines the association between the childs sleep                 pattern and mother-infant attachment in 94 mother-infant dyads.                 At 12 months each dyad participated in the Strange Situation procedure;                 77% were securely attached. Mothers description of the infants                 fussiness was not found to predict the attachment pattern, but was                 associated with the sleep habits. It was found that 55% of the secure                 and 60% of the ambivalent children were described as night wakers.                 To a sub-group of 37 infants, a sleep monitor (actigraph) was provided                 for two nights recordings. The frequency of the objective awakenings                 was higher than what mothers reported but similar for the secure                 and insecure infants. The findings confirm that night waking at                 the end of the first year is a common developmental phenomenon.                 Among this group of non-risk infants, sleep characteristics were                 only marginally associated with the quality of the childs attachment                 relationship. Sadler   S. Sleep:   what is normal at six months?Prof Care Mother Child 1994 Aug-Sep;4(6):166-7. In this study, part                 of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC),                 researchers surveyed the parents of 640 babies. Some of the results: Only 16% slept through the night at six months old  84% were not sleeping through the night at 6 months 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times 5% woke once every night 9% woke most nights 50% woke occasionally 16% of six-month-olds had no regular sleeping pattern Armstrong   KL, Quinn RA & Dadds MR. The   sleep patterns of normal children.Medical Journal of Australia 1994 Aug 1;161(3):202-6. The above study is the                 definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38                 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response                 rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their                 childs sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few                 questions related to their perceptions of their childs sleep behavior. What did they find? There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior. Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age. Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age dont have a daytime sleep every day. Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night). Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months. Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their childs sleep behavior. Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.  Although this study                 did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of                 understanding of normal sleep patterns can lead to supplementing,                 early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors                 claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux                 (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38                 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them                 to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than                 one month.Scher A. A   longitudinal study of night waking in the first year.Child Care Health Dev 1991 Sep-Oct;17(5):295-302.Abstract: A longitudinal study of the development of sleep                 patterns addressed the issue of continuity and change in night waking                 in the course of the first year. Mothers of 118 infants, who took                 part in a follow-up study of normal babies, completed a sleep questionnaire                 at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Regular night waking was a common characteristic                 throughout the first year:Babys     age%     babies waking at night3     months46%6     months39%9     months58%12     months55% The number of awakenings per night was a function of age. Following                 a decline in the number of interruptions from 3 to 6 months, an                 increase in night waking at age 9 months was recorded. Although                 the methodology does not lend itself to an objective validation                 of the changes in sleep-wake states, nor is it suitable for causal                 explanations, it is, nevertheless, important to note this profile.                 The increase in night waking towards the end of the first year coincides                 with significant socio-emotional advances which characterize this                 developmental stage.Wooding AR, Boyd J, Geddis DC. Sleep patterns of New Zealand infants during the first 12 months of life.   J Paediatr Child Health. 1990 Apr;26(2):85-8.,Abstract: The sleeping patterns of 874 infants aged 1-12   months were recorded by   parents over a 6 day period. The most striking   feature of the results   was the wide range in total hours slept by   infants of the same age, for   example, the average total sleeping time   per 24 h period for 4 month old   infants was 14.8 h with a range of   11.0-19.3 h. Furthermore, over the 6   day period, individual infants   showed wide variations in their sleeping   times with a range as great   as 12 h. Despite these wide variations,   several clear trends emerged:   from 1 to 8 months, a decrease with age of   the average number of hours   slept per 24 h period; and from 8 to 12   months, and a continuing   shift towards a dominance of night over day   sleep. The frequency of   night wakings was, on average, 77%, a finding   that contrasted sharply   with parental perception of frequency of night   waking; the transition   from bassinet/carrycot to cot was most common   between 3 and 4 months   of age; 25% of babies slept with the light on, 9%   used a dummy, and   37% sucked their fingers; first-born infants woke   significantly less   often at night than those with one or more sibling.   These results   provide an important comparative data set on the sleep   patterns of   infants. Elias MF,   Nicolson NA, Bora C, Johnston J.

Pediatrics. 1986 Mar;77(3):322-9.Abstract: Published norms for infant sleep/wake patterns                 during the first 2 years of life include an increase in length of                 maximum sleep bout from four to five to eight to ten hours by 4                 months but little decrease in total sleep in 24 hours from 13 to                 15 hours. Thirty-two breast-fed infants were followed for 2 years                 and data collected on 24-hour patterns of nursing and sleep. Infants                 who were breast-fed into the second year did not develop sleep/wake                 patterns in conformance with the norms. Instead of having long unbroken                 night sleep, they continued to sleep in short bouts with frequent                 wakings. Their total sleep in 24 hours was less than that of weaned                 infants. This pattern was most pronounced in infants who both nursed                 and shared a bed with the mother, common practices in many nonwestern                 cultures. The sleep/wake development accepted as the physiologic                 norm may be attributable to the early weaning and separated sleeping                 practiced in western culture. As prolonged breast-feeding becomes                 more popular in our society, the norms of sleep/wake patterns in                 infancy will have to be revised.More   information Sleeping through the night (this website)Nursing to Sleep and Other Comfort Nursing (this website)The Family Bed (this website)Gerard CM, Harris KA, Thach BT.

How Tandem Nursing Birthed Me as a Mother of Two,http://kellymom.com/ages/tandem/tandem_nursing_birth/,"by Hilary Dervin FlowerReprinted with permission from the author. Double-Stacked Side-Lying Nursing PositionHeres the picture. My distraught two-and-a-half year old daughter                 is insisting on nursing, lying down like a baby, on a favorite                 spot on the bedroom floor. I know that if I can just nurse her down                 to sleep this temper tantrum will be over. I realize that my best                 bet is to lie down and nurse her on the lower breast. This way I                 can stack my three-week old son on top of her and he can nurse my                 upper breast.So there I was and I was thinking, Okay. did I REALLY sign up for                 this in the tandem nursing package?In my fatigue I gently lowered my newborns drowsy head to rest                 on his sisters arm. For a moment the house of cards stood, complete                 and perfect. But only a moment. I may even have imagined it. My                 toddler quickly and resoundingly erupted in objections to the imposition,                 and we were back to square one. It was then that I was knew that                 SOMETHING was very very wrong.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.And how on earth did nursing become a battlefield instead of a                 sanctuary?The Four Tandem Nursing SurprisesWhen my baby was first born and I nursed both children together                 I felt like Earth Mama. Peace, harmony, mama-love, and sibling bonding                 at the breast: it was a dream come true .But we had a few surprises                 the day after the babys birth day.Everyone expects regression, right? ButSurprise Number One! There                 was no greater or more frequent challenge during the first few weeks                 than my daughters steadfast insistence on nursing cradled like                 a baby. No, theres really nothing quite like having to sit, several                 times a day, with legs spread tailor-style, imagining the stitches                 in between popping one-by-one, so as to support the large and wiggling                 body of a nursing toddler. Add to that her delight in coming off                 (making me leak) so as to root so I could help her back on.                 And did I mention she couldnt hold her head up? Now add a tender,                 but thank god hardy, newborn on the other breast, and try to keep                 the toddlers feet and arms from doing permanent damage, and youre                 really looking at a job for the many-armed woman. Why, you ask, did I feel I had to put myself through such Medieval                 torture and so often? I see youve discovered the next surprise.Ah yes, Testing of Limits, the age old tradition of an unsettled                 sibling. Surprise Number Two: the battle ground for testing limits                 was my breast. And I must hand it to her, she chose well, because                 I had a lesson to learn there that I couldnt have learned so well                 anywhere else.If I said No to na-na she wailed. If I said yes, she subjected                 me to an endless series of misbehaviors at the breast. She would                 never end a nursing session voluntarily. I was forced to recognize                 that my hitherto eager-to-please daughter was TRYING to drive me                 crazy. Forcing me to draw the line where I least wanted to, at the                 physical symbol of our former intimacy.The next surprise still shocks me in retrospect  can it be that                 I really experienced a lapse in my love for my daughter? In fact                 I remember that while I was pregnant I felt a little sorry for the                 child in my womb, and a little guilty, fearful that I could never                 find for a second child that intensity of true love and adoration                 I still felt, almost painfully, for my first. And yet  Surprise                 Number Three: as I wallowed in love with my newborn I found it incredibly                 difficult to relate  at all  to my first born.I suddenly found her normal speaking voice loud, her presence jangling,                 and her body ungainly and huge. She seemed unfamiliar and almost                 grotesque nursing in my lap, as if I were nursing a teenager. I                 looked at her and tried with great concentration to recall what                 it was that had seemed so achingly endearing about her just days                 ago.My eyes, ears, and heart were doing tricks on me, I knew, like                 fun house mirrors. Tuning into my sons miniature scale blew her                 up to be large, loud and old. It was as if my biology was plugging                 me into the newborn only by ripping the connection I had with my                 first.Within a couple weeks, the bizarre distortions dissolved like a                 bad dream. I never knew where they came from or where they went.                 All I knew was that all of the sudden, thank goodness, I could see                 my daughters wholeness and beauty once again. Now I had to find                 my way back to her.And so I stumbled headlong into Surprise Number 4: My darling daughter                 was in on the conspiracy to put distance between us. I was no longer                 Mama. I was just NAAAA NAAAA! To compensate, she began to pour                 herself into other relationships like never before. This strategy                 worked fairly well until her godmother flew home and her father                 went back to work, something mother nature had evidently not been                 counting on.So  four dirty tricks nature appeared to be playing on our continued                 nursing: (1) I was nursing a 28-pound newborn (2) with the defiance                 of a two-year old (3) who I wasnt sure I wanted anywhere near my                 breast and (4) who would sooner bite than hug me. Thats right                  all the normal new-sibling negativity focused right on my breasts.                 Now, wheres that tandem nursing glow? How I Catapulted Things from Bad to WorseAdjusting to the arrival of a new baby is never easy. Could I really                 be there for her in the way she needed me to be now that the new                 baby was here? Neither of us appeared sure. After particularly contentious                 days I would lie awake at night grieving for the lost sense of intimacy,                 feeling helpless to renew it, and yearning to curl up against her                 little body, so appealingly innocent in sleep, and make up for all                 the love I failed to deliver to her during the day. And somewhere in there we both began to expect me to meet her emotional                 needs by nursing, and on her terms. as if by meeting her Olympian                 challenges I could somehow prove my devotion to her once and for                 all and we could both sleep easy at night. A losing proposition                 if ever there was.And so crazy became CRAZIER became TOTALLY OUT OF WHACK.I knew that she needed me to set boundaries  I had this vague                 understanding that when children test limits they crave the reassurance                 which secure limits provide. But I found myself stretching                 them. and stretching them. and streeeeetching them. When she tried                 my patience at the breast I gave her third and fourth chances before                 finally taking her off my lap. I was so afraid of letting her down                  at the breast. I said yes whenever I could. When push came to                 shove I would have given anything to split right down the middle                 and give both children what they seemed to need. From there it was just a few short hops over to the most ridiculous                 nursing position known to mama-kind. .I dont think Double-Stacked                 Side-Lying was in my nursing manual.Course CorrectionDesperate, I tried a radical experiment. Ill give you na-na when                 it will feel good to both of us. If I didnt like a behavior at                 the breast it stopped or wed stop altogether. No fear. A clear                 boundary. Soon, etiquette came back. A warm feeling ebbed back in                 to our nursing. Debates, scuffles, and wheedling about na-na continued,                 but I found it made a big difference that these exchanges existed                 in the dialogue dimension  in the space between us  not at the                 breast. I continued to struggle in vain for a conviction that we had what                 it took to make it through. And yet all the while, an invisible                 something was at work, bringing us to safety. Slowly, it began to                 dawn on me, my daughters purpose in all that limit-testing at the                 breast. If I could really say no to nursing  a lot  with no                 apologies or guilt, right in the middle of a family crisis, then                 I sure as hell MUST believe that we could both take it.I MUST believe that the important things like boundaries were still                 just as important now as before. I MUST believe that I was enough mama for her even if I wasnt                 able to DO all the things I used to do for her. I MUST believe that our relationship could TAKE our feelings, our                 sadness, fears, doubts, and anger which arose, most immediately,                 as a result of that boundary being firmly preserved, and more generally                 as a result of the new baby in the family. And so, amazingly, by the end of the first month, the dust was                 beginning to settle. All that had been up for grabs, the very bonds                 that connected us, having been doubted and tested, were being reaffirmed.                 Nursing, with both children and separately, began to assume the                 character of the important, but routine. Her disappointments over                 na-na came into scale with her other skinned knees and toddler                 travails. Epilogue, and Fond Farewell to Tandem NursingMy daughter went on to nurse for another 18 months, and I have                 long since forgotten what it was like to have only one child. I                 remember our tandem nursing crisis as my screaming labor pain of                 being birthed into a mother of two. Funny that the truth I had to                 work so hard to find was right there from the beginning, outlined                 in our triangle of nursing on the first day my son was born. One                 Mama, two breasts. I have enough to give both children just as I                 am. We are each of us only human. And in the honest sharing of what                 is truly ours to offer, we are enough. AUTHOR BIOHilary Dervin Flower lives in Florida with her three children.

A Farewell to Arms – and Legs … and Feet …,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/gordon03/,"excerpted with permission from:Good Nights  The Happy Parents Guide to the Family Bed(and a Peaceful Nights Sleep!)by Jay Gordon, M.D. and Maria GoodavageGriffin Trade PaperbackISBN: 0312275188excerpt from Chapter Seven A Farewell to Arms  and Legs  and Feet Youve stroked his downy hair as he dreamed his first baby dreams in your arms. Youve clung to the edge of the bed while his little body somehow took up all the room. Youve slept your sweetest sleep while he nestled so cozily in your arms. And youve barely caught a wink while sleep transformed him into a future World cup soccer star.Now comes a bittersweet time. Your little one wants his own bed. Or youd like him to start moving in that direction.For some, the transition is quick and simple. This child says hed rather sleep in his room by himself one night, and hes off. (Yes, it really does happen this way with some kids.)Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.For others, it takes time.On days when it seems like your child will never leave the family bed, it can help to keep this in mind: Your child really will leave! The transition out may not come as early as youd imagined when you first brought your newborn into bed. (Trust us, your baby wont be covetously eyeing his crib at seven months, wishing he could just sleep all alone instead of with loving parents.) But your child will be sleeping on his own soon enough. The time goes so fast, and the nights he spends snuggling next to you will be but a blink  at least in hindsight.But just how does a child whose greatest love is sleeping next to warm and adoring parents actually end up willing and able to sleep without them? It depends on the child, on family dynamics, on parental philosophies, even on the setup of the house. Believe it or not, there are as many ways for a child to leave the family bed as there are ways for a child to enter the bed in the first place!Some parents are purists, not wanting to influence their childs departure from the bed at all. Others believe in gently helping a child move on when they feel the time is right for everyone.We now bring you a plethora of ideas, much practical advice, and, we hope, something that will work for you and your family when the time comes for your child to move beyond the family bed.return to Jay Gordon CollectionExcerpted with permission from Good Nights: The Happy Parents Guide to the Family Bed (And a Peaceful Nights Sleep)by Jay Gordon, M.D. and Maria Goodavage, copyright 2002Website: http://www.drjaygordon.com/Buy this book from Amazon.comFacebookPinterestTwitter"
The Sandman Cometh: Sound Solutions for a Satisfying Sleep,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/gordon02/,"excerpted with permission from:Good Nights  The Happy Parents Guide to the Family Bed(and a Peaceful Nights Sleep!)by Jay Gordon, M.D. and Maria GoodavageGriffin Trade PaperbackISBN: 0312275188excerpt from Chapter Four The Sandman Cometh: Sound Solutions for a Satisfying SleepIn this chapter we will bring you answers to questions weve been asked by family bed parents about ways to get a better nights sleep. If you have a nighttime woe from the family bed, youll probably find a solution to it here.Q: In three months were expecting our second child, and our two-year-old son is still in bed with us. I dont think hes ready to move into his own bed yet, and I really dont mind if he stays. But I dont know how we can make it work with two kids and two parents. What should we do?A: Your son may not care to move out of bed yet, but his own bed may start looking mighty appealing to him when the new baby takes up residency in your bed. In fact, a top reason children leave the family bed is because of the arrival of a new sibling there. As Angie, a mother of a three year old and a newborn, told us, Our son put up with the decreased space, the baby noises, and my waking for night feedings for two nights. On the third night, he asked if he could sleep in his own bed, and that was that.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.If you think your son will opt to stay on, you may want to consider creating more space by having him move to his own twin bed pushed right up flush beside yours. If you can get it at the same level, its more like an extension of your own bed, and he may well enjoy the extra space of this big boy bed. The big benefit is safety, since you dont want to be like a tin of sardines when the baby arrives.Another option for your bed setup is to place mattresses or futons on the floor, side by side. (As we mentioned earlier, if youre going to do this, make sure the floors are as free of dust as possible so allergies dont become and issue.) A few families weve interviewed have had a room filled with wall-to-wall mattresses for them and their two or three (or in one, case, four) children. These parents have warm and fuzzy memories of waking up in the morning with little limbs and faces everywhere. I wouldnt trade those times for anything in the world, says one such den mother.Whatever setup you choose, its important that your infant doesnt sleep beside your older child. Sleeping children dont always have the same awareness of their surroundings as adults and can pose a hazard to a baby.A final note: We advise any parent who will be changing the bed setup because of a new baby to make any changes at least a few months before the babys arrival. That way the child doesnt see the baby as displacing him.Q: Any ideas on how I can have a little time to myself while my baby naps? Right now shes as a point where she wakes up when I put her down for a nap, and Im getting frustrated. A: This question doesnt have the nice, neat sleep-stage answer the previous one did because naps are a different animal from nighttime sleep, and vary greatly. But there are a couple of tips we can give you.If your baby takes two naps a day, your best bet for being able to leave her sleeping happily on her own is the afternoon nap. REM sleep (the active, lighter sleep stage) often predominates in morning naps, according to sleep expert Dr. Anders, and NREM sleep (deeper sleep, harder-to-wake baby) in afternoons. Wait until you see the signs of deep sleep mentioned in the previous answer, and then make your getaway after youre sure shes in a safe place. See Naptime Notes, page, 66, for more on safety for babies sleeping alone.We also highly recommend wearing your baby in a sling or other kind of baby carrier during her naps. Shell likely sleep very well nestled beside your moving body, and you can get lots done while she sleeps. Granted, you wont be solo, and you wont be able to clean the oven or scrub the tub (darn!), but at least your hands and legs will be free.Another possible solution for you is a baby swing. Some parents swear by baby swings, other swear at them, thinking of them as just another mechanical substitute for mom. In the same vein, some babies love swings, while others would swear at them if they could. We say if you need some time alone, and your baby is happy in the swing, let her take little naps in it.return to Jay Gordon CollectionExcerpted with permission from Good Nights: The Happy Parents Guide to the Family Bed (And a Peaceful Nights Sleep)by Jay Gordon, M.D. and Maria Goodavage, copyright 2002Website: http://www.drjaygordon.com/Buy this book from Amazon.comFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Good Nights – The Happy Parents’ Guide to the Family Bed: Introduction,http://kellymom.com/parenting/nighttime/gordon01/,"excerpted with permission from:Good Nights  The Happy Parents Guide to the Family Bed(and a Peaceful Nights Sleep!)by Jay Gordon, M.D. and Maria GoodavageGriffin Trade PaperbackISBN: 0312275188IntroductionMost babies dont come into the world terribly aware of the popular phrase Sleeps like a baby.But most parents would really, really like their infant to sleep like the mythical baby in this expression. After all, staying sane and happy in a childs formative years is important, and getting some sleep can do much toward those goals.Sleep is such a huge concern of parents that if I didnt have to talk about it during my patients checkups at two months of age, four months, six months, and all the way through to the five-year-old visit, I think I could finish my office day by noon!Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Unfortunately, many tired and frustrated parents in our culture rush out and buy one or two of many popular sleep-training books, which generally instruct parents how to let babies cry alone in their cribs until they learn how to sleep.But theres another way for everyone to get more sleep. Its kinder, gentler, easy on your mind and body, and it usually feel so right to baby and parents. Its been around since before humans were humans and is still practiced in most parts of this planet.It goes by many names: Co-sleeping, bed sharing, sleep sharing, the family bed.Simply put, the baby shares your bed. It makes nighttime much easier. In fact, it can make nighttime positively blissful. (How many parents of cribbed infants can say this?)But even more than this, new scientific discoveries are revealing that babies were meant to be beside parents at night. A few surprising benefits of co-sleeping:The family bed offers many protections that can actually help save a babys life. (I firmly believe a safely set up family bed is safer than solitary infant sleep.)Family bed babies cry less than babies who sleep alone-a boon to both babies and parents.Family bed children end up more independent and better adjusted later in life than those who slept without parental contact.And this will knock your socks off:Most family bed parents have very satisfying sex lives. This finding demolishes the nagging myth that the family bed spells death to sex!My patients taught me about the family bed. They showed me that it was a safe, flexible, and healthy alternative to the rigid sleep habits I had been told to dictate to the parents in my practice.In medical training we often learn to give advice based on theoretical science rather than by looking at the practical aspects of taking care of families and children. Watching moms and dads and babies work out their own sleeping arrangements and patterns helped me understand the many different answers to questions about sleep.In my practice, and in TV and radio appearances, I stress to parents just how safe a safely set up family bed is. The new scientific findings underscore what Ive been witnessing for decades. I have never had a single crib death in all my years of practice, and I can assure you that its not because of any spectacular skills I have at preventing SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). Its because the parents in my practice almost all sleep with or very near their babies.I never recommend separate rooms for newborns and parents. Never.I have wanted to write this book for many years but I needed Maria Goodavage. Her journalistic background and experience wit her first child moved her to do extensive research on the topic; then she found me to be her medical support and coauthor.If your baby could talk, shed beg you to read this book.

Herbal safety for nursing moms,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/herbal_safety/,"It is                 possible for anyone (mother or baby) to have an allergic reaction                 to just about anything. Watch your baby closely for any adverse                 reactions if you take any herb or medication. Keep in mind that most herbal treatments have not been thoroughly                 researched, particularly in regard to lactation. Natural                 substances are not automatically safe! Herbs are drugs, so                 it is necessary to use caution when using them. Here are some suggestions for nursing moms when considering herbal                 remedies, from Ruth A. Lawrence, MD (author of Breastfeeding:                 A Guide for the Medical Profession): Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Avoid the pharmacologically active herbal teas. Drink any herbal teas only in moderation. Limit intake of any herbal preparation that combines several active ingredients. Always check the label. Even vitamins and simple echinacea may contain herbs that should not be used by breastfeeding mothers. Use only reliable brands that have ingredients and concentrations clearly marked on the label, as well as the expiration date and the name of the manufacturer and distributor. Be sure to check with your physician before taking any natural remedy, since it could interact with other medications you take or need.    Source:Herbs                 and Breastfeeding by Ruth A.

Breastfeeding and Thyroid Problems: FAQ,http://kellymom.com/health/mom-health/thyroid-faq/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCIs it safe for a mom with thyroid disease to breastfeed?Low thyroid levels (hypothyroid)High thyroid levels (hyperthyroid)Thyroid autoantibodiesCan breastfeeding prevent some thyroid problems?Is it safe for a mom with thyroid disease to breastfeed?Yes. Even if moms thyroid levels are not controlled by medication (or are in the process of being controlled) it is safe for mom to breastfeed her baby.Low thyroid levels (hypothyroid)Moms who are hypothyroid have low thyroid hormone levels and elevated TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels. Symptoms include cold intolerance, weight gain, dry skin, thinning hair, poor appetite, fatigue, depression and reduced milk supply.Per Medications and Mothers Milk (Hale 2012, p. 1076), Thyroid stimulating hormone (Thyrotriopin, TSH) is known to be secreted into breastmilk, but in low levels. Virtually none of it would be orally bioavailable or transferred into human milk. Because TSH is significantly elevated in hypothyroid mothers, if present in milk at high levels, it could theoretically cause a hyperthyroid condition in the breastfeeding infant. However, Hale goes on to cite a study which found only low levels of TSH in the breastmilk of a mom with extremely elevated TSH levels. Hales recommendations report no pediatric concerns via milk, and state that Breastfeeding by hypothyroid mother[s] is permissible.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Untreated low thyroid levels in mom may result in a decrease in milk supply and sometimes poor weight gain in baby (due to low milk supply). Per Breastfeeding and Human Lactation (Riordan & Wambach 2010, p. 522-523), If replacement therapy of thyroid extract is adequate, the relief of the symptoms and an increase in the milk supply can be quite dramatic.High thyroid levels (hyperthyroid)Moms who are hyperthyroid have elevated thyroid hormone (usually T4) levels. Symptoms include weight loss (despite an increased appetite), nervousness, heart palpitations, insomnia, and a rapid pulse at rest.Hyperthyroidism is not a contraindication for breastfeeding. Per Medications and Mothers Milk (Hale 2012, p. 673-674, 679-680), only exceedingly low levels of thyroid hormones (both T4/levothyroxine and T3/liothyronine) transfer into breastmilk.In animal studies, high thyroid levels interfered with milk let-down (Lawrence & Lawrence 2011, p. 570-574).Thyroid autoantibodiesMothers who have the autoimmune forms of thyroid disease will usually have thyroid autoantibodies present in their blood. Hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimotos Thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroid disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the thyroid gland, resulting in underproduction of thyroid hormone. Another common autoimmune thyroid disease is Graves Disease, which is a leading cause of hyperthyroidism; in this disease the antibodies attacking the thyroid gland cause growth of the gland and overproduction of thyroid hormone. Some mothers may be worried that these antibodies may pass into breastmilk and harm baby, however this is not a concern. The thyroid autoantibodies are IgG immunoglobulins, which are too large to pass into breastmilk. Continuing to breastfeed will only benefit your baby, as babies who are artificially fed are at increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease themselves.Can breastfeeding prevent some thyroid problems?There is evidence that breastfeeding can help to prevent thyroid problems in both mom and baby.Breastfeeding helps to prevent autoimmune thyroid disease (Fort 1990).Breastfeeding may help to prevent thyroid cancer in mom (Mack 1999).Breastfeeding and Thyroid Problems: LinksBreastfeeding and Thyroid Problems: Studies and ReferencesFacebookPinterestTwitter"
Conscious Sedation and Breastfeeding: Recommendations for Patients,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/meds/sedation/,"by Maurenne Griese, RNC, BSN. Reprinted with permission from the author.www.breast-pumps.comIntro | Oral Agents | Inhalation Agents | IV Sedation | Additional guidelines for care | ConclusionOnline Resources | ReferencesAs a lactation professional, I am often asked about the compatibility of breastfeeding with certain medications. I refer to both my experience and knowledge of the drug in question as well as what the medical literature has to say about the safety of the drug for both mother and baby.As a registered nurse working part-time for an oral surgery practice, I often administer drugs for IV conscious sedation for dental procedures, most commonly for wisdom tooth extractions. We also offer nitrous oxide sedation and oral sedation for patients who do not wish to be as sedated as they might be for IV sedation.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The majority of female patients we see in our clinic for IV sedation are of childbearing age. Some of our patients are breastfeeding mothers and they often have questions about what drugs for sedation are safe in terms of:Safety for the babySafety for the motherEffect on milk supplyOften times, discontinuing breastfeeding for a surgical or diagnostic procedure requiring sedation is the only alternative suggested to a nursing mother. Discontinuing breastfeeding is typically not necessary.Today, many women, armed with knowledge and assertiveness, search for other ways or other practitioners who are willing to work with them as they have their procedure with sedation and continue nursing. They know that for most medications, very little of the drug is transferred to their milk. Additionally, very few medications have adverse effects in breastfed babies because the dose transferred to the milk is in such a low dose or it is poorly bioavailable to the infant.Thomas Hale is one of the worlds expert on Pharmacology and Lactation. His book, Medications and Mothers Milk, is an excellent reference for lactational pharmacology and a resource guide I use frequently. Dr. Hale has an informative article on his website that discusses how drugs enter human milk.The medications often used for sedation procedures in dental offices include:Triazolam (Halcion)Diazepam (Valium)Nitrous OxidePhenerganDecadronFentanylVersedPropofolMany medical professionals use these same or similar drugs for other surgical or diagnostic procedures requiring sedation.Oral AgentsTriazolam and diazepam are used as oral pre-operative sedatives, often taken one hour prior to a procedure with a sip of water. If a patient is breastfeeding, the oral sedative of choice would be triazolam with a half life of 1.5-5.5 hours compared to diazepams half life of 43 hours. Some pediatric concerns of poor suckling, lethargy and sedation have been reported with Valium. The milk to plasma ratio with Valium has been reported to be as high as 2.8.Inhalation AgentsThe inhalation agent of choice in dentistry is nitrous oxide blended with oxygen, also know as laughing gas. A nitrous oxide/oxygen blend helps to reduce anxiety and works as a sedative. In the dental office, the patient breathes the gas through a nasal mask. Patients describe a sense of well being and relaxation. It works quickly and wears off quickly, making it a good choice for breastfeeding mothers and breastfed babies. Its half life is less than 3 minutes.Agents Used for IV Sedation include:BenzodiazepinesDiazepam (Valium)Midazolam (Versed)Narcotic AnalgesicsAlfentanil (Alfenta)Fentanyl (Sublimaze)Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)MorphineBarbituratesMethohexital (Brevital)Thiopental (Pentothal)Sedative/HypnoticsPropofol (Diprivan)Reversal MedicationFlumazenil (Romazicon)Naloxone (Narcan)IV sedation is a great alternative for breastfeeding mothers undergoing surgical or diagnostic procedures. The IV medications listed above produce quick, effective sedation. Recovery time from these sedative agents is also short. The majority of patients tell us they were comfortable and do not remember much if anything about the procedure.The IV medications listed above have a very short half life and the milk to plasma ratio is low for most of these drugs, except Valium and Morphine. The half lives of these drugs are quite long and the milk to plasma ratio is somewhat higher than the other drugs listed. Some references suggest using caution with these drugs, and some do not. My advice is to use caution when using these drugs with the breastfeeding mother, or even better, chose a more appropriate alternative besides diazepam or morphine.Additional guidelines for carePrior to surgery, encourage the mother to plan for assistance at home after surgery to allow time for recovery. Arrange for nursing her baby immediately prior to surgery. If her baby is exclusively fed from the breast, it is important to refer her to a lactation consultant to assist her with coordinating supplementary feedings and assisting with arrangements for a breast pump on a temporary basis. If necessary, she can express and freeze a supply of breast milk before surgery.Postoperatively, the mother can safely nurse her baby once she feels more alert. Pain medication can be taken safely as prescribed. Most practitioners prescribe the exact same pain medications for postoperative pain relief as are prescribed for postoperative pain relief following a Cesarean birth.ConclusionIt is important for the health care professional to inform the mother of the risks and benefits, possibilities and options given the evidence available about the safety of breastfeeding and using the medications discussed in this article. It is not appropriate for health care professionals to advise ALL mothers to discontinue breastfeeding or to pump and dump for surgical or diagnostic procedures requiring oral, inhalation or intravenous sedation because most medications used for oral, inhalation and IV sedation are compatible with breastfeeding. They have no effect on milk supply and very minimal or no effect on the infant.With breastfeeding mothers, the health care professional should consider avoiding diazepam and morphine as sedative agents for a surgical or diagnostic procedure because of their long half life and higher milk to plasma ratio. Alternative medications that do not impact the breastfeeding relationship are readily available for sedation for surgical and diagnostic procedures.Maurenne Griese graduated from the Northeast Louisiana University School of Nursing in 1989. She served as a US Army Nurse for 5 years and has experience in labor and delivery, mother baby nursing, childbirth and breastfeeding education and continuing education for health professionals.

The length of time will depend upon the type of radioactive material used, the dose, the age of the baby, whether baby is getting anything other than breastmilk, and how often mom expresses milk. If use of a particular radioisotope requires that you wean temporarily (some dont), youll want to pump regularly while the radiation is working out of your system to reduce radiation exposure to breast tissue. At least 97% of the radioactivity is gone from your body in 5 half-lives  after this point it is generally considered safe to breastfeed (but other factors may also need to be considered). The more often you pump, the more quickly the radioactivity will be eliminated from your body. It may be possible to have your milk tested for radioactivity, perhaps by the radiology department at the hospital, to help determine when it is safe to return to breastfeeding.Important note: If you do suspend breastfeeding due to use of radioactive isotopes, it is important to pump regularly during this time. See also Maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing. You do not need to dump this milk. It can be dated, frozen and used after 5+ half-lives of the radioisotope have passed (after 5 half-lives, 96.9% of the radiation is gone; after 10 half-lives, 99.9% of the radiation is gone). You may also get your milk checked for radiation by your radiology/nuclear medicine department.Specifics on certain testsAlways check with your nuclear medicine department to find out exactly which radioisotope will be used. Once you have this information, you can look it up in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission table and other references.HIDA/Hepatobiliary scan (for gall bladder problems)  This test usually uses Tc-99m-Choletec or Hepatolite,which should not require an interruption of breastfeeding for doses of 4mCi or less; or Tc-99m-DISIDA, which should not require an interruption of breastfeeding (see the links below for detailed information).Bone Scan  This test usually uses Tc99m-DP or -HDP, which should not require an interruption of breastfeeding for doses of 30 mCi or less (see the links below for detailed information).Thyroid Scan or Treatment  see Breastfeeding and Thyroid Problems: Diagnostic Testing & TreatmentsMore information & referencesFor the most up-to-date specifics on different radioactive agents, see the latest edition of Medications and Mothers Milk by Thomas Hale, and/or the LactMed online database, maintained by the National Library of Medicine.

The risk of using the drug in breastfeeding women clearly outweighs any possible benefit from breastfeeding.

Dental Work and Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/dentalwork/,"(x-rays, local anesthesia, sedation and more)By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCBoth x-rays and novocaine (and other drugs used for local anesthesia, such as bupivacaine and lidocaine) are considered to be compatible with breastfeeding.Most medications used for oral and IV sedation are considered compatible with breastfeeding.Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) sedation is also considered to be compatible with breastfeeding. It is virtually insoluble in the bloodstream, which means it goes from your brain to your lungs to the room air immediately after you stop breathing it in. Per Hale, it is rapidly eliminated from the body due to rapid exchange with nitrogen via the pulmonary alveoli (within minutes). A rapid recovery generally occurs within 3-5 minutes Ingestion of nitrous oxide orally via milk is unlikely. See Conscious Sedation for more information.A mother who has wisdom tooth surgery should not need to interrupt breastfeeding at all (except during the surgery, of course). To minimize babys exposure (and increase moms comfort), mom can nurse just before she goes in for the procedure. There is no need to wait on breastfeeding afterwards or to pump and dump  mom can nurse as soon as she feels alert enough to hold baby.

Breastfeeding and Lyme Disease,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/lyme-disease/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCPer the US                 Centers for Disease Control, Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and is transmitted to humans via                 the bite of a tick infected with this bacteria. The Lyme disease                 bacteria has not been cultured from human milk (though associated                 DNA have been detected  see below), and no babies have developed                 Lyme disease from their mothers milk. Here is what we know:  In a paper from the US Centers for Disease Control website (Cooper & Feder, 2004), it is stated that: B. burgdorferi has never been cultured from human breast milk, and there is no case of an infant developing symptomatic or asymptomatic B. burgdorferi infection from breast milk.In one study (Ziska et al, 1996), seven breastfeeding mothers with Lyme disease were studied, and none of their babies contracted Lyme disease.In another study (Schmidt et al, 1995), DNA associated with Lyme disease were detected in the breastmilk of two mothers, but neither of their babies contracted Lyme disease  per Lawrence & Lawrence (2005), it is not known whether the DNA were from infectious spirochetes or were non-infectious DNA fragments.If a mother does become infected with Lyme disease, she will likely                 not know about it until symptoms appear (7-14 days or longer), and                 baby will have already been exposed to the illness at that point                 (IF it can be transmitted via breastmilk  we dont know whether                 this is possible). Breastfeeding builds babys immune system and                 will also provide baby with extra antibodies to Lyme disease. Discontinuing                 breastfeeding would deprive baby of the extra immune protection                 from breastfeeding. The general consensus is that breastfeeding should continue if                 a mother has Lyme disease, especially if she has already started                 or completed treatment. There are several medications that can be                 used to treat Lyme disease in breastfeeding mothers. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Lawrence & Lawrence (in Breastfeeding: A Guide for the                 Medical Profession, 2005) suggest that since we dont have                 concrete evidence on the possibility of transmission, this should                 be discussed with the mother and (depending on the mothers wishes)                 breastfeeding could be withheld until the mothers treatment has                 been started or completed. They recommend observing baby for symptoms                 of Lyme disease whether or not the mother discontinues breastfeeding                 temporarily, and treating baby if symptoms appear.

Breastfeeding and West Nile Virus,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/illness-surgery/westnilevirus/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC(This is current info as of September 2006)Breastfeeding mothers have been concerned about West Nile Virus (WNV) since the flurry of publicity in Fall 2002 about the transmission of West Nile via breastmilk.The current recommendation from the US Centers for Disease Control is that a mother should not interrupt breastfeeding if she contracts West Nile Virus, since the risk to the baby from weaning to infant formula is greater than the risk posed by the potential WNV infection.Here is what we know:Components of breastmilk (IgG, IgM, lipids) have been shown in laboratory tests (in vitro) to be active against West Nile Virus. See Antiviral factors found in human milk for more information.Live West Nile Virus (the intact, infectious form of the virus) has not been cultured from breastmilk. Fragments of genetic material (RNA) and WNV-specific antibodies have been cultured from breastmilk.In September 2002, a woman contracted West Nile Virus from a postpartum blood transfusion. Her newborn was exclusively breastfed and exposure to WNV through anything other than breastmilk was unlikely.At 16 days postpartum, the mothers breastmilk tested positive for WNV antibodies (IgM, IgG) and WNV genetic material (RNA, not the live virus).At 17 days postpartum, the mother discontinued breastfeeding.At 24 days postpartum, the mothers milk tested negative for WNV genetic material (RNA), and positive for WNV antibodies (IgM).At 25 days postpartum, the infants blood plasma tested positive for WNV antibodies (IgM).Per the CDC:Although WNV genetic material was present transiently in breast milk, the specific timing and source of the infants infection remain unclear Until live virus is cultured from breast milk, or until definitive data are obtained to document WNV transmission through breast milk, the findings described in this report should be interpreted with caution. source: CDC. Possible West Nile Virus Transmission to an Infant Through Breast-Feeding  Michigan, 2002. MMWR 2002;51(39);877-878.Per the CDC:WNV RNA has not been identified previously in breast milk, and no studies are known that define the implications of this laboratory finding. Laboratory investigations, including attempts to culture WNV from additional breast milk samples, are under way. Until live virus is cultured from breast milk, or until definitive data are obtained to document WNV transmission through breast milk, the TaqMan findings described in this report should be interpreted with caution The risk for transmission of WNV from mother to infant through breast-feeding is unknown. The infant described in this report remains healthy despite breast-feeding for 17 days. Until follow-up testing on the infant is completed, it is unknown whether the infant was infected with WNV. The health benefits of breast-feeding are well established, and these findings do not suggest a change in breast-feeding recommendations. source: CDC. Update. Investigation of West Nile Virus Infections in recipients of Organ Transplantation and Blood TransfusionMichigan, 2002. MMWR 2002;51:879.The baby remained healthy throughout and had no symptoms of West Nile Virus.Keep in mind that in many cases where mom has been exposed to West Nile Virus via mosquito bites (the primary route of infection), baby has also been in contact with those same mosquitos.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.If mom does become infected with WNV, she will likely not know about it until symptoms appear (3-14 days), and baby will have already been exposed to the virus at that point (via a mosquito bite and/or breastmilk). Breastfeeding builds babys immune system and will also provide baby with extra antibodies to West Nile Virus.Discontinuing breastfeeding would deprive baby of the extra immune protection from breastfeeding, and is not advised.Additional Information on West Nile Virus & BreastfeedingWest Nile Virus and Breast-feeding FAQ from the US Centers for Disease ControlMore from the CDC:West Nile Virus (WNV) Infection and Breastfeeding: Information for CliniciansCDC.

Breastfeeding and Marijuana,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/marijuana/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCMarijuana is on the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs (2001) list of Drugs of Abuse for Which Adverse Effects on the Infant During Breastfeeding Have Been Reported. The AAP notes Only 1 report in literature; no effect mentioned; very long half-life for some components.Separate from the direct, chemical effects of marijuana on a baby, use of marijuana may affect a mothers ability to be able to properly care for her baby. Maternal judgment may be impaired.Any secondhand smoke the baby is exposed to increases the amount of the drug your baby receives. Also, because street drugs are rarely pure, marijuana may be laced with other drugs or substances that can also be harmful to the breastfeeding baby.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.The active ingredient in marijuana, THC, will be stored in moms fat tissues for long periods (weeks to months) and will build up in the body with continued use. Small to moderate secretion into breastmilk has been documented, and THC is concentrated in human milk. According to Hale, analysis of breastmilk from chronic heavy users indicated an eight-fold concentration in milk compared to moms blood plasma, however the dose received by baby was insufficient to produce significant side effects. Studies have shown significant absorption and metabolism in infants, although long term effects have not been shown.Marijuana can cause sleepiness in the baby, which can lead to slow weight gain and possibly slow overall development in the baby long term. In addition, babies whose mothers smoke marijuana regularly have a higher risk of SIDS.Hale reports a possibility of decreased milk production. In animals, THC decreases the amount of milk produced by suppressing the production of prolactin and, possibly, by a direct action on the mammary glands.There is significant brain growth occurring during a babys first months of life; marijuana may alter brain cells. Animal studies (on babies whose mothers milk contained THC) have shown that DNA and RNA metabolism may also be affected and the proteins needed for proper growth and development impaired.After a breastfeeding mother uses marijuana, THC is evident in her babys urine and stools (Perez-Reyes and Wall, 1982). Infants exposed to marijuana via breast milk will test positive in urine screens for long periods (2-3 weeks).One study (Astley and Little, 1990) found that exposure to marijuana through their mothers milk during the first month of life resulted in decreased motor development at one year of age. In another study of 27 infants evaluated at 1 year of age who were exposed to marijuana via breastmilk (compared to 35 nonexposed infants), no significant differences were found in terms of age at weaning, growth, and mental or motor development. Follow-up of these infants has been limited.Long-term effects of marijuana exposure through breastmilk are unknown.References and additional informationCannabis.

For something like this to pass into the milk enough to                 affect baby, moms exposure would probably need to be to such an                 extent that she becomes very ill.

Toddlers do wean…,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/considering-weaning/toddlers-do-wean/,"Reprinted                 with permission from the author. My daughter, Jenna, was a continuous nurser. She                 nursed day and night for 2 years. We co-sleep, so night nursings                 were a bit easier. I also thought she was nursing for comfort, but                 soon realized that she was taking milk and swallowing, so I figured                 she was hungry. She really nursed around every 2 hours for almost                 24 months. But I just kept reminding myself how lucky I was to have                 a healthy, attached babyToddlers do wean Many wise women                 here have been telling me that for at least 6 months. I have been                 stressing about it for awhile now. I never imagined Id be nursing                 a 2 year old, heck, I never imagined nursing an 18 month old..                 To be quite honest, I was uncomfortable with the idea of breastfeeding                 a toddler. Im not sure why, but I guess I have not known a single                 person who has nursed this long. Anyway, all of a sudden this breastmilk                 addicted child of mine started sleeping through the night.and                 last night she woke and never ask to nurse, just wanted a cuddle                 from me. Then this morning she asked for a cup of bunny milk (strawberry                 stuff in milk) and breakfast. I kept waiting for her to ask to nurse,                 but she didnt. Nap time rolls around and instead of telling her                 it was nursy nap time, I just had her lay with me in bed. She asked                 to nurse and I said Nah, lets just cuddle and she slid her hand                 just slightly down the front of my shirt and cuddled against me                 and minutes later.she was asleep. I think we are well on our                 way to weaning. I cant imagine that shell end this abruptly, but                 I am positive that it will happen soon. Gosh, I have been waiting                 for this. I wanted to let her nurse for as long as I could, and                 not ruin our wonderful experience by forcing her to stop. Its working. So here I am in a silent house wondering why I am not celebrating.                 Heck, I have been waiting for this, right?!?!?! Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.I think I should pass along a few things to you new moms who are                 feeling tied down to your babies, or feeling like you just cant                 take nursing another daySomeday it will be over. Trust me.                 I speak from experience. Jenna is 24 months old and never took a bottle or paci. She spent                 most of the first year nursing every 2 hours. Then between 1 and                 18 months, we were still nursing at least 5-10 times a day. Was                 it hard and sometimes frustrating? YEP! I have a DS who just turned                 6 and it was hard for me to figure out ways to spend the time with                 him that he needed and deservedBUT I did it. I learned many creative                 things to do while holding a nursing baby. And when she was sleeping,                 I made sure he and I always did something he wanted to do.                 I found a way to keep my house nice and clean, and even put dinner                 on the table. My husband works 24 hour shifts and is not here alot..BUT                 I manage. The thing that kept me going was knowing deep in my heart that                 this is worth it. That letting her nurse, and letting her be attached                 to my hip was going to give her that extra *jump* on life. really,                 I think, what if she were the 1 in whatever percent that was going                 to end up with cancer? What if the 2 years worth of breast milk                 changed that??? Or what if I was on the path to ending up with breast                 cancer? Maybe the 2 years of nursing her changed the odds for me                 too. That is alot of *what-ifs* BUT I sure dont want to know if                 it would have been differant had I not nursed. Alot of woman worry about having their bodies back.well trust                 me that once you have a child, your body will never be yours again.                 Both of my children share my heart, my armsand my mind. I am                 their blanket, their jungle gym and their stroller. That is what                 motherhood is. Breastfeeding or not, it sure changes you. Am I different than any other mother here? No.I am no super-momjust                 one who realizes how fast this wonderful time in our lives pass                 by. Toddlers do wean when they are ready.Trust Me! UpdateI think I posted that on a Sunday, and it was the                 last time she nursed. Well.I think I can say it is official now Jenna                 has not nursed in 8 days. I think we are weaned. Wow.it just                 happend..snaplike that. She doesnt ask to nurse, but she has                 taken to poking my breasts and telling me that they are funnyLOL.                 And last night she hugged me and said I like you mommy and I laughed                 and said it back.then she pointed at my breasts and saidI                 like naw-neeies too. Then she just ran off to play. It amazes me                 that after worrying about weaning for so long that it would happen                 that fast. I wish I could put into words all of the emotions that                 I have about our breastfeeding relationship, and it coming to an                 end But I cant. I do have to say that weaning was very bittersweet.                 It is a bit harder to parent when I cant just offer a boob to fix                 things. I also have to say that I disagree with setting a date                 to wean by. To me nothing would be harder than taking away the breast                 so suddenly. Overnight weaning is not good for a baby. Sometimes                 we tend to forget that babies are BABIES and can not process info                 like we can. They cant understand why we would suddenly take away                 their most prized thing. Imagine having someone take away your                 car. you still have to go to the store, work, visiting friends,                 and errand running.. If you woke up one day and had to figure                 out what to do it would be difficult. BUT weigh that against gradually                 getting used to not having a car. You could find ALTERNATE forms                 of transportation a bus, taxi, friend BUT you would have                 time to prepare. Isnt it funny how for those first tough months                 after the baby is born we think that the round the clock nursings                 will never end??? They dotrust me, faster than you thinkand                 I sure have been there, and done that. Looking back I have to say that nursing Jenna for                 2 years is one of the things I am most proud of. I have given her                 a benefit that many babies are not getting.

Breast comfort for mom during weaning,http://kellymom.com/ages/weaning/wean-how/weaning_mom/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC, Becky Flora, IBCLC and Paula YountIf your breasts feel full and uncomfortable when you dont nurse at a specific time, then express just enough milk to relieve the fullness. You can do this by pumping for a couple of minutes or hand expressing. The less milk you remove, the quicker your body will realize it doesnt need to produce. Sometimes just taking a hot shower will do the job  anything that relieves the fullness is fine. If you are comfortable without expressing at all, thats okay too.Do express or pump if you get uncomfortably full. Its not good for your body to not have any way of relieving the fullness. Pumping or hand expressing just enough milk to relieve discomfort will not prevent your milk supply from decreasing. What causes milk production to stay the same or increase is adequate milk removal. If only a small amount of milk is removed from the breast, then milk production will decrease. In addition, expressing a little milk will relieve your discomfort and make it less likely that youll develop plugged ducts, a breast infection, or an abcess.Do not bind your breasts to help your milk dry up. This is an outdated practice that can cause plugged ducts, breast infection, or breast abscess.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.These things are commonly used to increase moms comfort during the weaning process:Ibuprofen or other pain relieversCabbage leaf compressesThese things are occasionally used to reduce milk supply during the weaning process:Herbs and other natural treatments for reducing milk supplyBirth control pills, especially those containing estrogenSudafed (pseudoephedrine), a decongestantAdditional informationWeaning (main menu)@Cabbage for relieving engorgement @ Too much milk: Sage and other herbs for decreasing milk supply @ Weaning as a Natural Process by Brylin Highton, from Leaven, Vol. 36 No. 6, December 2000-January 2001, p. 112-114.Sadness and depression during (and after) weaning@FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Information is Your Ally in preparing to breastfeed: 10 Tips for Success,http://kellymom.com/pregnancy/bf-prep/bf-preparation/,"by Eva Lyford. Reprinted with permission from the author.One of the most common questions a breastfeeding support person gets asked is How do I prepare to breastfeed? In the bad old days, sometimes moms were told to toughen their nipples  descriptions of which were enough to make even the most breastfeeding inclined mom shiver and reach for a bottle. Scientific research has shown, to our relief, that no toughening is needed. But there is still a lot to do in order to prepare Before Delivery NOTHING BUT THE MAMA: Specify on your birth plan that no artificial nipples, pacifiers, sugar water or formula be given to your baby unless medically indicated, prescribed by your pediatrician and approved by you. (If supplemental feedings are needed they can be given via oral syringe.) Make a sign for your babys hospital bassinet that says I AM A BREASTFED BABY no artificial nipples, formula or pacifiers please!! I made mine with a bunch of breastfeeding related cartoons so the nurses got a laugh out of reading the sign, too. Keeping everything EXCEPT your nipple away from babys mouth will help prevent nipple confusion. NATURAL WOMAN: Babies born via unmedicated labor often breastfeed more easily than those born via medicated labors  medicated labors arent a problem for all women and babies, but you improve your odds for successful breastfeeding if you can reduce or limit interventions during labor. IVs during labor can also cause or increase engorgement, so are best avoided if possible  even if you cant avoid using them completely, try to limit the amount of fluid used. Moms whose births include more interventions have lower rates of breastfeeding  but there are plenty of exceptions! An excellent resource for information on childbirth is The Thinking Womans Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.SUPPORT YOUR BREASTS: Educate yourself about breastfeeding and have a support network ready to answer questions and support you in breastfeeding. Check out a LLL meeting if you get a chance! La Leche League welcomes pregnant mothers at their meetings. You can locate a group near you at the LLLI website. Here are some recommended books and a list of books to avoid. Does your hospital or birth center have a lactation consultant on staff? If not (or if you birth at home) arrange to be able to see one within the first 24 hours if things arent going well. Heres info on how to find a lactation consultant. Call a few before your baby comes, select one you like and keep her contact info with you in the hospital in case you need it. Hopefully everything will go really well and you wont need to call, but that way youll have the info if you need it.STOCK UP in advance: at least 2 good supportive nursing bras, nursing pads, 100% purified lanolin for sore nipples, pajamas with easy access for nursing (not necessarily expensive nursing pajamas, even pajamas with button up or pull up tops will do), and frozen peas/gel packs and cabbage to ease any breast engorgement/soreness/inflammation. This is the bare minimum equipment; some moms also find it helpful to have a rocker, a sling, a pump, breastmilk storage bottles or bags, a nursing pillow, or other items, but you can do fine without these, too.PLAN YOUR WORK & WORK YOUR PLAN: Writing up a birth plan and reviewing it with your doctor, midwife, doula and pediatrician to make sure that there are no issues with it prior to the birth is an excellent step. Note, a birth plan is not something that just granola-eating, Birkenstock wearing nudist hippy moms use! Plenty of moms use them to help identify what would make a good birth experience, and allow them to plan for and work towards it. In this day of the professional, educated working mom, birth plans seem to many like a natural extension of the analytical process used for event planning. Many of us had wedding plans, which is usually a less stressful event! Clearly, a birth plan should not be a document that you confront your health care providers over, but something you agree to work together on.Immediately After Delivery GET IT ON: Breastfeed your baby as soon as possible after you deliver. Babies who are breastfed within the first hour generally have more successful breastfeeding experiences than those who arent. Any medical procedures that arent urgent may be delayed to accommodate this important first step, and many procedures can be done while the baby is breastfeeding. LETS SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER: Room in with baby, so that you can breastfeed frequently and also ensure your wishes arent ignored with regard to baby. (For example, they tried to take my 1st son three times for medical procedures; I had to keep defending him from eager residents!) OUT OF YOUR SHELL: Nipple shells can be useful immediately postpartum to help draw out the nipple and to shield sore nipples from contact with fabric. These are different from shields, which CAN be useful but are often overused, and used in the wrong place at the wrong time. Also, purified lanolin ointment can help if you have sore nipples. Have some on hand or know where you can get them right away, if needed.Postpartum Period ZZZZZZZZZZZZ: When they say to sleep while baby is sleeping, it is definitely true that you should! This is NOT just a friendly piece of advice to pamper the new mom  it is a necessity. Your endorphins/adrenaline will carry you for about a week before you crash  hard. Dont let that happen  get help from family and friends, and focus on recovering from childbirth and on breastfeeding.WHOS NORMAL ANYWAY: Understand what normal breastfeeding is like. See What is Normal? and Breastfeeding as Baby Grows and the wonderful descriptions of normal breastfeeding in The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding by LLL International. Hang out with a breastfeeding friend for a while, or visit a La Leche League meeting and see nursing moms in action.Good luck, and enjoy your new baby!Additional Information@ Nursing your newborn  what to expect in the early weeksThe Importance of Skin to Skin Contact by by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPCBabys Second Night by Jan Barger, RN, MA, IBCLCRecommended BooksBooks to AvoidHow does milk production work?What should I know about giving my breastfed baby a pacifier?Nursing after a C-SectionBreastfeeding: Starting Out Right (links)@ other websitesWhat is Normal? by Paula YountBreastfeeding as Baby Grows by Becky Flora, IBCLCThe Science of Mother Love: Is Science Catching Up to Mothers Wisdom? by Cori Young[PDF] The Chemistry of Love: Could the first opportunity to fall in love influence our ability to love for a lifetime?

Hands-free pumping,http://kellymom.com/bf/pumpingmoms/pumping/hands-free-pumping/,"By Catharine Decker, MDFamily Medicine/Urgent CareLuther-Mayo-Midelfort Health SystemsReprinted with permission from the author.This tutorial was created for breastfeeding mothers, lactation consultants, breastfeeding educators, nurses, physicians and any other health care professionals and is intended to help breastfeeding mothers who must use a breast pump to express milk. There are many hands-free pumping systems available on the market today, but many are relatively complicated and expensive and/or require special bras or equipment. This simple method utilizes very inexpensive and readily available materials and functions well for most women.Please feel free to copy and use these illustrations and instructions to share with your patients and other health care and lactation professionals. They were created with the intent to be shared and distributed for breastfeeding education purposes. You have my permission to print them out, copy and distribute them for educational purposes. You also have my permission to copy them and place them on your own breastfeeding education websites.Begin with two elastic ponytail holder bands. (Rubber bands may be substituted, but are not quite as sturdy and may break with repeated use.) The ponytail holders are inexpensive and can be purchased at most discount stores. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Overlap edges. Loop the two elastic bands together to form a figure-eight. Pull knot tight. Meet Mimi, my model for this demonstration. If Mimi looks a little sad, its because shes made of brown paper packaging tape. Shes my home-made dressmakers dummy, formerly used for fitting clothing when Im sewing. Shes a few years old and a little out of shape after a few years of sitting down in my basement. She needs a good bra fitter, but shell have to do.  Please ignore the markings, they indicate landmarks for sewing purposes.Prepare bottle. Then loop one end of the figure-eight band around the funnel.Hook the other end of the figure of eight over the clasp on the nursing bra.Position pump funnel over breast. The bra can be adjusted up around the funnel to help support it and the mothers shirt can be positioned around the top of the funnel, which will also help support the funnel and bottle in place. As the bottle fills, the weight of the bottle provides additional stability. For bras which fasten in the center or otherwise do not have compatible clasps to fasten the loop over, it is still possible to use this system. Before positioning the bottle funnel, loop the figure-eight piece around the bra strap as shown.Wrap one loop over around the bra strap and pull through the other loop. Pulling loop through. Pull the loops taut. Now proceed as before, fitting the open loop of the elastic holder around the bottle and positioning the bottle over the breast.Bottle in position with center-fastening bra.This photo illustrates hands-free pumping using the elastic band method together with a nursing shirt. The nursing shirt (or any shirt) when positioned around the funnels, helps hold everything in place.All ready to pump. As you can see, this method can be quite discreet, especially if the mother has a nursing shirt. Any regular top can be adjusted down around the top of the funnels to give privacy as well. Note that the photo shows pumping one side only, but the method is perfectly suited to pumping both sides simultaneously, pumping one side or even pumping one breast while nursing baby on the other breast.More resourcesDIY Pumping BrasGalactablogHands-Free Pumping Breastfeeding in Combat BootsDIY Free Breast Pumping Bra another rubber band trick, with a different way to attach the elasticsDIY NursingTopsGalactablogDIY Breastfeeding HacksGalactablogRelated Items from the KellyMom Store:The Breastfeeding Mothers Guide to Making More MilkSarah Wells Abby Breast Pump Bag in Navy StripeFacebookPinterestTwitter"

Breastfeeding Manners,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/nursing-manners-2/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC 2005 P. YountKneading, patting, twiddling, scratching, pinching, grabbing moms nose, biting, pulling at moms shirt, playing with or pulling moms hair, blowing raspberries on moms breast, breastfeeding standing up, breastfeeding upside down, acrobatic breastfeedingDoes any of this sound familiar?? 2005 P. YountAll of these things are very normal breastfeeding behaviors for older babies and toddlers. Many things children do when they are breastfeeding are cute or downright funny  but what if its a behavior that you dont like? However normal it may be, there is no reason mom has to put up with behaviors that are painful or annoying when breastfeeding.Tips for curbing unwanted breastfeeding behavior:Start early 2005 P. YountEncourage good breastfeeding manners and discourage unwanted behavior early on. For example, many mothers start using a code word for breastfeeding long before baby is talking, and even a very young baby can learn not to bite when nursing.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Be firm, clear and consistent with your expectations.Be patientBehavior changes take time.Wait it out 2005 P. YountMany breastfeeding behaviors are a phase, where your child is experimenting with what he can do while breastfeeding. If a particular behavior is only mildly annoying, then one option is to wait for a bit to see if the novelty wears off on its own.Distract and RedirectFind another way to occupy your childs hands. Suggest he touch his own body or clothes instead of yours. Show him how he can rub your arm rather than pinch it. Try holding hands, tickling/kissing/blowing on his hand, playing finger games, counting fingers, having him point to different things, clapping, etc.Give your child something to hold and play with while nursing (a small toy, blanket, etc.). If your child isnt interested in the first thing you try, try different sizes and textures (hard, soft, textured, silky). If your child wants to play with your hair, or your nose, or the other breast, then try to find something of a similar texture or size that might serve as a reasonable substitute.Wear a nursing necklace or bright scarf to redirect your childs attention.Talk, read a book or tell a story to your child while you nurse. Songs or finger plays can also be fun.Gently discourage unwanted behavior 2005 P. YountIf your child plays with the opposite nipple/breast (often called twiddling), try wearing a bra or other clothing that is not easily accessible, or covering the opposite breast with your hand or arm. Combine this with distraction and redirection as discussed above.Consider a firm reprimand: Be still or Keep Mommy covered or If you keep doing that we will stop nursing. Use a firm voice but not so firm that it scares your child. You might also hug your child close to you or hold his hand to reiterate the point.Stop breastfeeding if your child continues and explain in a few simple words why you stopped nursing. Say something like I cant nurse you when youre squirmy. Lets go play and get the wiggles out and we will nurse in a little while. Offer to nurse again in a few minutes, or wait until your child asks to nurse again.Avoid the more difficult situations 2005 P. YountSome children go through a stage where breastfeeding in public can be a problem. Perhaps your child is really distractible or wiggly, or insists on flapping your shirt up and down.If your child needs to breastfeed but will not settle down for nursing, try offering a snack or a little water or other beverage from a cup. If youre uncomfortable breastfeeding in public, try to nurse before leaving home and tell your child that youll nurse as soon as you get to a more private spot (delaying breastfeeding like this works better when baby is over 18 months and is not overtired).Before you leave home, discuss with your child what behavior you expect from him when youre out. For instance if he tends to pull your shirt up, ask his help in keeping you covered while youre out.Is it okay to have different rules for breastfeeding when you are at home than when you are in public? 2005 P. YountAbsolutely! There are many situations where we have different expectations for public or private behavior, and breastfeeding is simply another of these. There is a time and a place for acrobatic breastfeeding, but for the majority of moms, its not when they are nursing in public. Many moms allow their nurslings to be creative at home, but require breastfeeding behavior that is more modest and sedate when they are out in public. Most children adapt pretty easily to rules that are different in different situations. If your child is having problems with the double standard, however, try keeping the rules more consistent until he is a little older.Do you have concerns about the way your child asks to breastfeed, particularly in public? 2005 P. YountDoes he pull on your shirt, stick his hand down your shirt, or ask loudly to breastfeed? Or are you afraid that he will in the future? Try incorporating a code word for breastfeeding and/or teaching your child a sign for breastfeedingmany mothers do this long before their child becomes verbal. Depending on the childs age and the situation, many mothers will only breastfeed if their child asks in an acceptable manner.

I have thrush. Can I give baby my expressed milk?,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/child/thrush-expressed-milk/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC  Candida albicans is a single-celled fungal organism that                 is widespread in our environment and normally lives harmlessly in                 the mouth, GI tract, skin and vagina. Under certain conditions (immature                 or weakened immune system, broken skin, hormonal changes, antibiotic                 or corticosteroid use, etc.) an overgrowth of candida can occur,                 leading to various forms of candidiasis, including oral thrush,                 yeast diaper rash, nipple/breast yeast, yeast vaginitis, and jock                 itch.Using fresh or refrigerated milk during thrush treatmentWhile you and baby are being treated for yeast, your refrigerated                 and fresh milk may be given to baby without a problem. Remember that its recommended that you continue thrush treatment                 until one to two weeks after all thrush symptoms have disappeared                 (Amir 2002).Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Using milk frozen during thrush treatmentMilk frozen during thrush treatment can be given to baby without                 a problem while you are still being treating for thrush.Many sources recommend that mothers do not freeze expressed milk for later use when they are being treated for thrush. We                 do know that freezing deactivates yeast, but does not kill it (Rosa                 1990), so there is a theoretical risk that milk expressed during                 a thrush outbreak could reinfect baby at a later date. However,                 there have been no studies that tell us whether or not this defrosted                 milk is really a problem.What do reference books say?Per Riordan in Breastfeeding and Human Lactation (2004,                 p. 259):  It is not clear whether expressed milk of a mother with candidiasis                 should be saved and frozen for later use. Freezing deactivates yeast                 but does not kill it. Per Mohrbacher and Stock in The Breastfeeding Answer Book (2003, p. 483):   Research indicates that freezing does not kill yeast (Rosa                 1990). Suggest the mother give the baby any milk that was expressed                 and stored during a thrush outbreak while they are being treated.                 If that is not possible, suggest she boil it to kill any yeast before                 giving it to the baby. Per Wilson-Clay and Hoover in The Breastfeeding Atlas (2002, p.58):  Milk expressed during a yeast infection could possibly be                 a source of reinfection. Freezing does not destroy yeast. Per Newman and Pitman in The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of                 Answers (2000, p. 149):  Throwing away frozen milk collected while the mother has her                 problem with C. albicans seems to me a terrible waste.                 Although freezing the milk does not kill this organism, it is likely,                 given the antifungal factors in breastmilk, that the fungus will                 remain in the form that does not cause problems. How might mothers milk help to protect baby from thrush?Mothers milk may actually help to protect baby against                 candida overgrowth, as some studies have shown a greater incidence                 of thrush in babies who are formula fed (Zollner 2003, Hoppe 1997).                 Components of human milk, including sIgA and lactoferrin, are active                 against Candida albicans (Riordan 2004, Morrill 2003, Andersson                 2000, Goldman 1998). In fact, because human milk inhibits the growth                 of candida, it can be difficult to culture candida in milk without                 the use of special techniques (Morrill 2003). In addition, human                 milk encourages the growth of good bacteria such as                 lactobacillus in babys GI tract, which helps to limit fungal growth                 (Riordan 2004). These inherent defenses against candida overgrowth                 may help to prevent thrush in a healthy baby who drinks expressed                 milk containing candida from a previous outbreak.Expressed milk that has been frozen should still be protective                 against candida overgrowth. Lactoferrin and sIgA are two of the                 primary components of milk that are active against candida, and                 both sIgA and lactoferrin activity in human milk are unchanged after                 3 months of freezing at -15C (May 2005). What are my options?If you need to use expressed milk during thrush treatment, fresh                 or refrigerated milk (or milk frozen during thrush treatment) is                 best. If possible, save non-thrush frozen milk for later                 and avoid freezing milk until your thrush treatment has ended.If you do pump extra milk during thrush treatment, do not                 discard it. Label the milk so that you know it was pumped                 during a thrush outbreak, and then go ahead and freeze it. As noted above, milk frozen during a thrush outbreak may not be                 a problem for a healthy baby. If you wish to further minimize any risk of using milk frozen during                 a thrush outbreak: One option is to dilute the defrosted thrush milk by mixing it with milk expressed at a different time. Another option is to heat treat the defrosted thrush milk to kill most or all of the candida present. Per Amir and Hoover in Candidiasis and Breastfeeding (p. 3) and per Odds in Candida and Candidiasis: A Review   and Bibliography, 2nd ed. (p 14), candida usually dies   within minutes at a temperature of 122F (50C). Mohrbacher and Stock in The Breastfeeding Answer Book (p. 483) suggest that the milk be heated to boiling (212F/100C). Others suggest scalding the milk, which brings it to a temperature   right below boiling. How to scald milk: heat milk in   a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until   the milk begins to steam and small bubbles begin to form around   the edge of the pan; remove from heat. These high temperatures will kill most of the antibodies in   the milk, but this heat treated milk is still much more nutritious   than infant formula.Additional informationThrush @ ReferencesMay JT.

Engorgement Help:  Reverse Pressure Softening,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/rev_pressure_soft_cotterman/,"a technique to aid latching when a mother is engorgedFinnish | Russianby K. Jean Cotterman RNC, IBCLC. Reprinted with permission from the author.More health care providers are observing that mothers receiving multiple intrapartum IVs experience delay in expected postpartum fluid shift. Increased edema during the puerperium complicates engorgement, increases sub-areolar tissue resistance, distorts the nipple and interferes with comfortable, efficient latching. Edema may appear early, or later, within 48-96 hours, often lasting 10-14 days. (This may depend on both the quantity of IV fluid given and the time of infusion in relation to placental delivery, the stimulus for lactogenesis II.)Reverse pressure softening (RPS) is a simple intervention that has proven very helpful in the first 14 days postpartum. RPS uses gentle positive pressure to soften a 1-2 inch area of the areola surrounding the base of the nipple, temporarily moving some swelling slightly backward and upward into the breast. RPS may be applied by the health care provider, and/or taught to the mother/significant others, if necessary, over the telephone.Interstitial fluid volume increases 30% above normal before edema becomes visible. (Guyton) To contain edema, areolar tissues must expand, limiting their ability to extend the nipple well into the babys mouth. Early proactive use of RPS causes no harm and may facilitate increased milk transfer, reduce risk of nipple trauma, and help resolve engorgement.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Conversely, pumping may attract edema into the flange area, especially at maximum vacuum settings. Areolar tissue may then appear thickened, seeming to bury the subareolar ducts. Then, neither infant tongue action, fingertip expression nor the pump itself removes milk very successfully.RPS is best performed immediately before each attempt to latch, for as many feedings as needed:The mother may prefer to apply RPS herself, or the HCP, with her permission, may apply RPS.facing the mother, orfrom slightly behind the mother, reaching over her shouldersor place his/her fingers over those of the mother, to reinforce pressure.The firmer or more swollen the areola, the more time is needed to achieve pliability.RPS often forms temporary dimples or pits, but edema soon re-enters the pits after pressure is released.Positioning the mother with severe edema flat on her back during RPS delays re-entry of swelling, allowing a longer window of time for latching.Firmly but gently, press steadily on the areola, right at the nipple base.Pressure should not be firm enough to cause pain. Avoid discomfort with less pressure for longer intervals.Press inward toward the chest wall for a full 60 seconds or longer (10-20 minutes or more if needed. This is a good time for instructions.)Any finger combination may be used. (See diagrams)Mothers may find short nails with curved fingertips of both hands the most effective method.One-handed methods are convenient if the other hand is busy.HCPs may find straight-fingers or two-thumb methods more convenient.Use the flats of two thumbs or the first several fingers on each hand lengthwise above and below the nipple, creating a 1-2 inch long depression.Continue to alternate in opposite quadrants, with repeated 2 minute periods of pressure, partially overlapping the first set of pits, to keep edema displaced from the entire area at the base of the nipple.After RPS, additional fingertip expression to further soften the areola is much easier, more comfortable and more productive. Creating a special niche for the chin often permits deeper latching.Two handed, one-step methodFingernails short, fingertips curved;each one touching the side of nipple.Two handed, two-step methodUsing 2 or 3 straight fingers on each side, first knuckles touching nipple. Move  turn. Repeat above & below nipple.Two thumbs, two-step method (Step 1). Using straight thumbs, base ofthumbnail even with side of nipple.Two thumbs, two-step method (Step 2).Move  turn. Repeat above & below nipple.One handed flower holdFingernails short, fingertips curved,placed where babys tongue will go.(To see your areola better,try using a hand mirror.)Soft ring methodCut off bottom half of an artificial nipple to place on areola to press with fingers.Benefits of RPS include:Steady stimulation of nerves under the areola automatically triggers the milk ejection reflex, propelling milk forward in the breast, nearly always within 1-2 minutes or less.Excess interstitial fluid is temporarily moved in the direction of natural lymphatic drainage.Displacing milk slightly backward into deeper ducts relieves over-distention of subareolar ducts, reducing latch discomfort and facilitating milk transfer.Areolar elasticity is freed forextending the nipple more deeply into babys mouthresponding to the rippling of the tongue.Guyton, AC, Basic Human Physiology: Normal Function and Mechanisms of Disease, 2nd Ed., W.

Healing Tips for Nipple Cracks or Abrasions,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/nipplehealing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCThe following measures can be very helpful if the skin on the nipple is broken for any reason (cracked nipple due to shallow latch, tongue-tie/lip-tieor other anatomical variations,thrush, a bite, milk blister, etc.).Keep in mind that one of the most important factors in healing is to correct the source of the problem.Continue to work on correct latch and positioning, thrush treatment, etc. as you treat the symptoms, and talk to a La Leche League Leader and/or board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) if what youre doing is not working.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.During the nursing session | After nursing | Between nursings | Additional informationDuring the nursing sessionBreastfeed from the uninjured (or less injured) side first. Baby will tend to nurse more gently on the second side offered.The initial latch-on tends to hurt the worst  a brief application of ice right before latching can help to numb the area.Experiment with different breastfeeding positions to determine which is most comfortable.If breastfeeding is too painful, it is very important to express milk from the injured side to reduce the risk of mastitis and to maintain supply. If pumping is too painful, try hand expression.After nursingSalt water rinseThis special type of salt water, called normal saline, has the same salt concentration as tears and should not be painful to use.To make your own normal saline solution:Mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt in one cup (8 oz) of warm water. Make a fresh supply each day to avoid bacterial contamination. You may also buy individual-use packets of sterile saline solution.After breastfeeding, soak nipple(s) in a small bowl of warm saline solution for a minute or solong enough for the saline to get onto all areas of the nipple. Alternately, put the saline solution into a squeeze bottle and squirt it on gently; use plenty of saline, making sure to get it on all areas of broken skin.Avoid prolonged soaking (more than 5-10 minutes) that super hydrates the skin, as this can promote cracking and delay healing.Pat dry very gently with a soft paper towel.If baby objects to the taste of the residual salt from the saline rinse, rinse directly before nursing by dipping nipple(s) into a bowl of plain water. Pat dry gently.After the salt water rinseApply expressed breastmilk to the nipples to promote healingthis can be done in addition to other treatments.To promote moist wound healing (this refers to maintaining the internal moisture of the skin, not keeping the exterior of the skin wet) apply a medical grade lanolin ointment (e.g., Lansinoh, Purelan), soft paraffin/vaseline  or a hydrogel dressing (e.g., ComfortGel, Soothies).If you have thrush, follow the saline soak with an antifungal ointment or other thrush treatment.If needed, apply an antibiotic ointment (e.g. Bactroban/mupirocin, Polysporin) or Dr. Jack Newmans All Purpose Nipple Ointment(APNO; an antibiotic/anti-inflammatory/anti-yeast combo) sparingly after each feeding.Per Hale, Bactroban ointment (mupirocin; lactation risk category L1/safest), available only by prescription, may be the best choice for nursing mothers.Of the over-the-counter treatments, Polysporin (Polymyxin B Sulfate and Bacitracin Zinc) may be preferred for topical use in the nipple area of nursing moms over antibiotic ointments containing neomycin (such as Neosporin or triple antibiotic ointment). Neomycin carries a small risk (1-2% of the general population) of contact dermatitis (see The Role of Topical Antibiotics in Dermatologic Practice by J.J. Leyden, MD).It is not necessary to wash small amounts of antibiotic or APNO ointment from the nipple prior to nursing, even if baby nurses again within minutes (see Dr. Jack Newmans Sore Nipples handout). If too much ointment was used and there is an obvious amount remaining when baby is ready to nurse again, gently wipe the excess off with a damp cloth.Between nursingsKeep nipples exposed to air when possible. When wearing a bra, use fresh disposable pads (change when damp). Some mothers use breast shells to protect the nipple from the dampness and friction of the bra.If there is a specific injurylike a bitecold compresses (ice packs over a layer of cloth) may help: 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off; repeat as needed.Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) is compatible with breastfeeding.Once a day, use a non-antibacterial, non-perfumed soap to gently clean the wounded area, then rinse well under running water. Using soap on the nipple area is not recommended unless the skin is broken.Contact your health care provider if you notice:Fever, inflammation/redness, swelling, oozing, pus, or other signs of infection. It is possible to have multiple infections (both fungal and bacterial).If the nipple is obviously infected, then talk to your health care provider about the possibility of using an oral (systemic) antibiotic. One study indicated that topical antibiotics and good breastfeeding techniques might not be sufficient if infection is present. (See Livingstone V, Stringer LJ.

FAQ: Does Breastfeeding Cause Postpartum Hair Loss?,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/hairloss/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCPostpartum hair loss is a normal  and temporary  postpartum change that is unrelated to breastfeeding. Most women will return to their usual hair growth cycle between 6 and 12 months after birth.Many new moms notice hair loss  sometimes quite dramatic  around three months postpartum. This is a normal  and temporary  postpartum change that is unrelated to breastfeeding.Following is how the hair growth cycle works:All hair has a growth phase, termed anagen, and a resting phase, telogen. On the scalp, anagen lasts approximately 3 years, while telogen lasts roughly 3 months, although there can be wide variation in these times between individuals. During telogen, the resting hair remains in the follicle until it is pushed out by growth of a new anagen hair. from Telogen Effluvium by Elizabeth CW Hughes, MDNormally, around 85-95% of your hair is in the growth phase at any point in time, but the hormonal changes during pregnancy stimulate an increase in the percentage of hairs in the growth phase. As a result, many women enjoy thicker hair during pregnancy, as more hairs than normal are growing and fewer than normal are resting/shedding.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.With the birth of your baby (and the hormonal changes that accompany birth), a larger number of hairs than normal enter the resting phase. Since the resting phase is followed by hair shedding (and regrowth), new mothers will experience greater than normal hair loss once the resting phase ends.Postpartum hair loss commonly starts at around three months after birth. The amount of time between childbirth and the onset of shedding corresponds to the length of the resting phase of hair growth (between 1 and 6 months, with an average of three months). The hair loss can seem more extreme if your hair grew much more than normal during pregnancy, or if you have long hair. Most women will return to their usual hair growth cycle within six months, or between 6 and 12 months after birth.If you feel that your hair loss is greater than the norm, or if things are not back to normal by the time your baby is 12 months old, then see your doctor. Excessive hair loss can be caused by common and easy-to-remedy postpartum conditions such as hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone) or iron-deficiency anemia.What can you do while you wait for your hair to return to its normal growth cycle?Get a good haircut. Some moms choose this time to get a shorter haircut or one that requires less care.Experiment with different hairstyles.A good quality shampoo and conditioner may help.Try different styling products, such as mousses or texturizers that bulk up the appearance of your hair.Avoid using a brush or comb that pulls or stresses the hair.More informationLynfield YL.Effect of Pregnancy on the Human Hair Cycle.The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (1960) 35, 323327; doi:10.1038/jid.1960.127FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Engorgement,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/engorgement/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCWhat is Normal?It is normal for your breasts to become larger and feel heavy, warmer and uncomfortable when your milk increases in quantity (comes in) 2-5 days after birth. This rarely lasts more than 24 hours. With normal fullness, the breast and areola (the darker area around the nipple) remain soft and elastic, milk flow is normal and latch-on is not affected.How to prevent or minimize engorgementNurse early and often  at least 10 times per 24 hours. Dont skip feedings (even at night).Nurse on babys cues (on demand). If baby is very sleepy: wake baby to nurse every 2-3 hours, allowing one longer stretch of 4-5 hours at night.Allow baby to finish the first breast before offering the other side. Switch sides when baby pulls off or falls asleep. Dont limit babys time at the breast.Ensure correct latch and positioning so that baby is nursing well and sufficiently softening the breasts.If baby is not nursing well, express your milk regularly and frequently to maintain milk supply and minimize engorgement.Signs & Symptoms of EngorgementWhen?Engorgement typically begins on the 3rd to 5th day after birth, and subsides within 12-48 hours if properly treated (7-10 days without proper treatment).How does the breast feel? The breast will typically feel hard, with tightly stretched skin that may appear shiny, and you may experience warmth, tenderness, and/or throbbing. Engorgement may extend up into the armpit.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.How does the areola feel? The areola will typically feel hard (like the tip of your nose or your forehead) rather than soft (like your earlobe), with tight skin that may appear shiny. The nipple may increase in diameter and become flat and taut, making latch-on challenging.You may also have a low-grade fever.Moms experiences of engorgement differ. Engorgement:May occur in the areola and/or body of the breast;May occur in one or both breasts;May build to a peak and then decrease, stay at the same level for a period of time (anywhere from minimal to intense), or peak several times.Tips for treating engorgementBefore nursingGentle breast massage from the chest wall toward the nipple area before nursing.Cool compresses for up to 20 minutes before nursing.Moist warmth for a few minutes before nursing may help the milk begin to flow (but will not help with the edema/swelling of engorgement). Some suggest standing in a warm shower right before nursing (with shower hitting back rather than breasts) and hand expressing some milk, or immersing the breasts in a bowl or sink filled with warm water. Avoid using warmth for more than a few minutes as the warmth can increase swelling and inflammation.If baby is having difficulty latching due to engorgement, the following things can soften the areola to aid latching:Reverse pressure softening (directions in the link)Hand expressionIf the above two things are not effective, try pumping for a few minutes with a hand, electric (low setting) or juice-jar breast pump.While nursingGentle breast compressions and massageduring the nursing session can reduce engorgement.After nursing for a few minutes to soften the breast, it may be possible to obtain a better latch by removing baby from the breast and re-latching.Between feedingsIf your breast is uncomfortably full at the end of a feeding or between feedings, then express milk to comfort so that the breasts do not become overfull.Hand expression may be most helpful (though obviously second to breastfeeding) as this drains the milk ducts better.Mom might also use a hand pump or a quality electric pump on a low setting for no more than 10 minutes (engorged breast tissue is more susceptible to damage). A juice-jar pump may also be used.Massaging the breast (from the chest wall toward the nipple area) is helpful prior to and during milk expression.Its not good to let the breasts get too full, but you also dont want to overdo the pumping, as too much pumping will encourage overproduction. If you do need to express milk for comfort, your need to express will likely decrease gradually over time; if it does not, then try gradually decreasing the amount you express.Use cold compresses (ice packs over a layer of cloth) between feedings; 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off; repeat as needed.Cabbage leaf compresses can also be helpful.Many moms are most comfortable wearing a well fitting, supportive bra. Avoid tight/ill-fitting bras, as they can lead to plugged ducts and mastitis.Talk to your health care provider about using a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen (approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics for use in breastfeeding mothers) to relieve pain and inflammation.AVOID:Excess stimulation (for example, dont direct a shower spray directly on the breasts).Application of heat to the breasts between feedings. This can increase swelling and inflammation. If you must use heat to help with milk flow, limit to a few minutes only.Restricting fluids. This does not reduce engorgement. Drink to thirst.Contact your lactation consultant or health care provider if:Engorgement is not relieved by these measures.Baby is unable to latch or is not having enough wet/dirty diapers.You have mastitis symptoms: red/painful breast, temperature greaterthan 100.6 degrees F, chills, body aches, flu-like symptoms.You have any questions.Other treatments for engorgementCabbageApplying cabbage leaf compresses to the breast can be helpful for moderate to severe engorgement. There is little research on this treatment thus far, but there is some evidence that cabbage may work more quickly than ice packs or other treatments, and moms tend to prefer cabbage to ice packs.What are cabbage compresses used for?Engorgement.Extreme cases of oversupply, when the usual measures for decreasing supply (adjusting nursing pattern, nursing uphill, etc.) are not workingDuring weaning, to reduce moms discomfort and decrease milk supply.Sprains or broken bones, to reduce swelling.To use cabbage leaves:Green cabbage leaves may be used chilled or at room temperature.Wash cabbage leaves and apply to breasts between feedings.For engorgement or oversupply: Limit use as cabbage can decrease milk supply. Leave on for 20 minutes, no more than 3 times per day; discontinue use as soon as engorgement/oversupply begins to subside.During the weaning process: Leave the leaves on the breast until they wilt, then apply new leaves as often as needed for comfort.For further information on how to use cabbage leaves:Cabbage? Why Use It and How Does It Work? Instructions for Use by Paula YountCabbage Leaves for Engorgement by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPCCabbage Leaves for Prevention and Treatment of Breast Engorgement by Sandra Smith, MPH CHESJuice Jar breast pumpThis simple pump can be useful to help with engorgement, and to draw the nipple out when baby is having a difficult time latching on.Find an empty glass jar or bottle at least 1 liter in size with a 5 cm or larger opening. The type of bottle that cranberry juice comes in is often a good size.Fill the jar nearly full with very hot water. The glass will get very hot and you will need to hold it with a towel.Pour all the water out of the jar.Use a cool washcloth to cool down the rim and upper part of the jar so you can touch it without burning yourself (test it with your inner arm).Place your breast gently into the mouth of the jar so that it makes an airtight seal. Some moms lean over a table to do this, others put the jar in their lap on a pillow and lean forward. Expect this to take a few minutes, so make yourself comfortable.As the air slowly cools inside the jar, it creates a vacuum inside the jar and this gentle suction expresses milk from the breast. Break the suction immediately if you feel discomfort  if the jar cools too quickly it may create excessive suction which can damage breast tissue.Repeat for the other breast.Some moms need to repeat this, others find it works sufficiently with only one try.Fenugreek seed poulticeThis is a traditional treatment for engorgement or mastitis. Steep several ounces of fenugreek seeds in a cup or so of water. Let seeds cool, then mash them. Place on a clean cloth, warm, and use as a poultice or plaster on engorged or mastitic breasts to help with let-down and sore spots.

Carpal tunnel syndrome in breastfeeding mothers,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/carpal-tunnel-bf/,"by Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCCarpal tunnel syndrome can sometimes appear during pregnancy or postpartum. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with pregnancy is thought to be related to inflammation and edema of the median nerve as it passes through the wrist. It can take a few weeks to a few months after delivery for the symptoms to resolve but it usually clears up completely.Several cases of carpal tunnel syndrome in breastfeeding mothers have also been reported in the literature. In these cases, the carpal tunnel syndrome began within a month of birth and only completely resolved after weaning. Carpal tunnel syndrome has also been reported postpartum in non-breastfeeding mothers. In the three non-breastfeeding mothers who were studied, the symptoms were less severe and resolved within a month.It is possible that carpal tunnel syndrome in breastfeeding mothers may be related to or aggravated by repetitive motions and/or excessively flexed wrist positions during breastfeeding. A similar syndrome, deQuervains tendinitis, has been noted in mothers with babies 6-12 months old and is attributed to repeated lifting of an increasingly heavy baby.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Per WebMD, excessive repetitive movements of the arms, wrists or hands can aggravate the carpal tunnel. The ideal position for your wrist to be in is a neutral position, rather than bent back or forward. Carpal tunnel syndrome is made worse by bending the wrist, especially if the bending is sustained over time.Tips for breastfeeding mothers with carpal tunnel syndromePay attention to positioning. Are you curving your hand and wrist around your baby to support and cuddle him/her? Look for ways to support your infant that dont involve a bent wrist. Bed pillows, special breastfeeding pillows, rolled/folded baby blankets (particularly under the wrists) can all allow mom to hold baby without bending the wrist excessively. A footstool may also help with positioning baby in your lap.Use a baby sling to support baby.Breastfeed lying down, continuing to pay attention to wrist position.Use a specially designed wrist brace to keep your wrist in the neutral position while breastfeeding. Sleeping with the brace on can be especially helpful.Some say that the cross cradle hold (particularly long-term use) may cause or aggravate carpal tunnel syndrome, as babys weight is often supported by the hand in this positioning.The recommended treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is conservative, with rest, diuretics, hand splint, and local corticosteroid injection, because it is usually reversible. No women had residual signs or symptoms, so perseverance with lactation and symptomatic treatment is appropriate. Lawrence & Lawrence, in Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession, 5th ed.

Breastfeeding and breast abscess,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mother/breast-abscess/,"by Rhondda Smiley. Reprinted with permission from the author.I developed a breast abscess after I returned to work full time when my daughter India was 10 months old. I had mastitis my 4th day back, and then a recurrent plug that I just couldnt get rid of. By my sixth week back, I had a full blown abscess the size of a kiwi. It was horrible  the area was very tender, especially when my breasts were full or if my daughter hit it while nursing, and my entire immune system was very taxed. Almost as horrible was having to deal with medical professionals who were very ill-informed about breastfeeding, telling me to wean.There is some information on abscesses in Dr. Jack Newmans book, but I found it very difficult to find anything else about them. I called my La Leche League leaders, and searched the internet, without much luck. Fortunately, they are not too common, but this made for a frustrating situation as I was also dealing with doctors who didnt know much about breastfeeding. The most effective thing I did was to put out feelers to every single mother, doula, midwife, lactation consultant and LLL leader I knew by email. I was able to speak with three other mothers about their abscess experiences. This was invaluable.Here is what I learned. Abcesses are rare, occurring in 3-11 percent of women who have infectious mastitis. Abscesses can also develop with a recurrent plug that keeps occurring in the same spot. Abscesses can be diagnosed either by aspiration (lanced and drained with a needle by your doctor) or by ultrasound. If you are having an ultrasound, be sure to empty your breasts as much as possible before the test so that the technicians can more easily read the results. If you have an abscess aspirated, ask your doctor to culture the fluid that is drawn out so that an appropriate antibiotic can be prescribed.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Abscesses can sometimes be resolved just by being aspirated, but must sometimes be surgically drained (called an incision and drainage, or I&D). An I&D can be done either under a local or a general anesthetic. It is important to request that any incision be made radially (from the chest in towards the nipple) instead of around the areola. Many breast surgeries are done around the areola for aesthetic reasons, but this cuts more milk ducts and may affect milk supply. After an I&D, the incision is left open and packed with a dressing so that it can continue to drain and heal from the outside in.It is important to either nurse or pump the affected breast while the incision is healing to prevent engorgement, relieve pressure on the incision and help to prevent the recurrence of mastitis. As with any plug or mastitis, weaning cold turkey will likely complicate the problem. Some mothers are told that milk from cut ducts will leak from the incision and that they should wean immediately to prevent this. Yes, there can be some leaking at the incision (I didnt have any), but it shouldnt be a problem, in part because of the antibodies in the breastmilk. As long as the site of the abscess does not prevent it (i.e. if its very close to the areola or nipple), a mother should continue to nurse on the affected breast. If the location of the abscess prevents direct breastfeeding, then it is recommended that you express milk from the affected breast while the incision is healing to prevent complications (even if you intend to wean from that breast after the incision is healed). It is possible to obtain a custom-cut pump flange to facilitate pumping when the incision is very close to the nipple. I have met one mother who had an abscess very close to her nipple. She was unable to nurse on that side, and let her milk dry up on the affected side, but she continued to nurse only on the other side for many months.Of the three mothers I spoke to before my surgery, their experiences varied wildly. One mother was able to resolve the abscess by having it lanced in her doctors office. Another mother had an incision and drainage under general anesthetic with one night in the hospital. Another had an I&D under general anesthetic and had a 5 day hospital stay while being treated with morphine. (She said that her abscess had developed after a botched breast reduction.) So the condition and treatment of abscesses is obviously very individual.I had my abscess aspirated, but it just filled up again (not uncommon), so then had an I&D under a local anesthetic. The I&D was painful, but I had already spent over 2 weeks trying to get in with a breastfeeding friendly surgeon. I ended up with the director of the local breast clinic instead, who was less than supportive or knowledgeable about breastfeeding. But I didnt want to have an I&D done at the ER by a general surgeon, who was even less likely to be informed about lactating breasts. If I wanted a general anesthetic, the wait would have been even longer.I became angry many times due to the ignorant comments and actions of medical professionals that I encountered, especially those who were supposed to be breast experts, but seemed to know nothing about lactating breasts or breastfeeding. A radiologist who saw me at the ultrasound clinic asked if my 11 month old daughter was eating solids yet. When I said yes, she asked so breastfeeding is just a pastime then? This was at a clinic that dealt exclusively with screening breasts.In my initial consultation with the director of our local breast clinic, he basically told me that I should be satisfied to stop nursing at 11 months and that as my daughter was now on solids, that she really had no further need for breastmilk. When I went in for my I&D, he informed me once I was lying on the table that he wanted to give me Demerol. I said I did not know if it was safe while I was nursing (I had previously checked out local anesthetics with Motherisk for a dental procedure and knew they were OK) and could we call Motherisk? (This is a service at the Hospital for Sick Children here in Toronto that advises on the safety of various substances for pregnant and nursing mothers. Call them at 416-813-6780.) He asked when I would be nursing again (basically as soon as I got home) and said that it would wear off in 4-6 hours. He brushed off my request to call Motherisk. He offered to have it checked with the hospital pharmacist, but I did not trust this option, knowing that many pharmacists do not access accurate information regarding the safety of drugs for nursing mothers and babies. I decided to call Motherisk myself as soon as we were finished. (I did and found it was safe.) It only occurred to me later that while the drug may have worn off in 4-6 hours, it could have potentially had negative side effects for my baby for much longer. Fortunately, this was not the case.While I had made not one but two calls before the surgery to inquire about recovery, the surgeon told me while I was lying on the table that I would require a nurse to come in for 2-3 weeks to change my dressing. Since I had just returned to work full time, this new information added unnecessary stress I did not need during a medical procedure. Through my Demerol haze, I had to remind the surgeon and nurse not to cover my nipple with the bandage after the procedure. He told me that it would probably be too painful for me to nurse (he was talking to the WRONG MOTHER!), forgetting that Id already BEEN nursing with an abscess the size of an orange in my breast for the last two weeks.I was able to nurse right before and just a few hours after the surgery. I waited at the hospital for about 3 hours before I went home to nurse my baby. I tried pumping the affected breast when I got home, but it was actually easier for me to nurse because of where my incision was  sort of on the inside/underside of my breast. The pump actually covered the incision and this was uncomfortable. I just covered the site with my hand when I nursed so that India wouldnt accidentally hit it. She didnt rest on the incision, nor did she have any interest in the dressing. It took my incision about 2-3 weeks to close up. A nurse came into my home each day to change my dressing and check on how the incision was healing. She would rinse the incision with sterile saline, then pack the incision with a packing tape. I started to feel better immediately after the surgery since my body was no longer battling the infection inside me. Also, having that pressure off made nursing more comfortable too. I had absolutely no problems with supply after my surgery, and the incision was very small. My scar is about an inch long.Ironically, by the time I was dealing with the abscess, my daughter was deciding that she didnt want a bottle of expressed milk while I was gone. I didnt really need to pump any milk for her, but kept doing so until I was fully confident that my abscess was completely healed, so that I didnt run into any problems with plugs or mastitis when I weaned off pumping. I no longer pump, but my daughter continues to nurse into her now third year.A mother suffering from an abscess needs to get some rest and let herself heal. That is the message of mastitis and abscesses to every mother. She needs to rally her troops and get the same kind of support that she hopefully had in the first few days or weeks after birth  her partner to pick up the slack, maybe a mum or mother-in-law to come and spend some time, friends to make meals and help around the house or with older siblings  you know, all that good stuff that seems to dry up after the first month! She needs to do nothing but crawl into bed with baby tucked next to her, rest and feed her baby. Nothing else is more important.Rhondda Smiley is a mother who also works full time outside the home in arts and entertainment ticketing. She is actively involved in her local La Leche League group.

Nipple shields,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/nb-challenges/wean-shield/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCWhat is a nipple shield?Nipple shieldsA nipple shield is a flexible silicone nipple that is worn over the moms nipple during a feeding. Nipple shields should in general be considered a short-term solution and should be used under the guidance of a lactation consultant.Often, nipple shields are recommended within the first few days of birth. Frequently in these cases, the shields are not needed and are handed out without proper instructions for using and weaning from them  a shield should generally not be used during the first week after birth unless there is an obvious problem such as prematurity or difficulty latching which is attributable to some physical characteristic of the baby. Here is more information on when baby is not latching on yet , sore nipples, and getting a good start on breastfeeding.Disadvantages to using a nipple shieldDisadvantages to the nipple shield include:baby may get less milk if the shield is used incorrectlymom may be more at risk for plugged ducts and mastitis (if the shield causes reduced milk transfer)it can be difficult to wean from the shieldAdvantages to using a nipple shieldAlthough nipple shields should be used only after other options have been tried, it is better to have a baby on the breast with a shield than not on the breast at all! Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.What type of nipple shield is best?If youre using a shield, the thin clear silicon type of nipple shield is the best to use. There is also a variety of shield with a cutout that allows for more skin-to-skin contact than the typical shield. If youre using a rubber shield, seriously consider getting a silicone one instead. Using a baby bottle nipple on the breast is never a good recommendation.What precautions should be taken when using a nipple shield?Nipple shields with cutoutHere are a couple of things to keep an eye on until baby is weaned from the shield. By following through with the precautions that outlined below, you should be able to avoid or head off any problems:When using a shield youll need to carefully assess your baby for adequate intake (more here). Count his wet diapers every day and make sure that hes having at least 6 really wet ones each 24 hour period. You also will want to make sure that he stools at least three timesdaily if he is less than 5-6 weeks of age. After 5-6 weeks, his stools may come less often, but should still be loose and profuse even if more timehas passed. Baby will also need to be weighed frequently  at least every 2 weeks (make sure you use the same scale)  until it is clear that he is gaining well.You will also want to listen for frequent swallowing during the feeding and feel for overall good breast softening after the feeding. If your breasts are not well-softened after each feeding, you may need to pump until they are softened to ensure that your supply remains adequate. This will lessen your risk for plugged ducts and help to maintain your supply.Weaning from a nipple shieldThese things can help you start to wean from the shield:Ensure good positioning and latchMake sure that when positioning your baby to nurse you are holding him so that his whole body faces yours. He should not have to turn his head to nurse.Wait for the baby to open very wide  as with a yawn  before you attempt to latch him on.Once he has opened this wide  and it may take patience waiting for him to do so  pull him in real close making sure that he takes as much of the breast into his mouth as possible. His chin and nose should touch your breast. His lips should be flanged out  like a rose petal or a fishs lips. If they are not, use your finger to flip them out manually.Before attempting to feed at all, pump a few minutes. This will elicit let-down so that baby gets a quick reward. It will also elongate the nipple for him.Also before feeding, offer him your index or pinky finger nail-side down to suck on for several minutes. This suck-training teaches him to drop his tongue down as he must do with breastfeeding. With the shield (much like a bottle nipple) he may push his tongue to the roof of his mouth to slow the flow of milk.Breastfeed frequently  as often as you can. Attempt to feed before he gets too hungry  when he is sucking on his fingers or rooting, but before he cries. If you can catch him early he may be more willing to work with you. You also might try nursing when he is a little drowsy. Some babies are more willing to take the breast when they are semi-asleep than when fully awake.Try different nursing positions.Nurse while in motion  as you walk, sway, rock, bounce, etc.Provide lots of skin-to-skin contact when nursing and at other times as you can. Undress baby to his diaper and remove your blouse if possible. Try nursing while you both enjoy a warm bath.Drip expressed breastmilk (or formula, or sugar water if no ebm is available) over your nipple in the corner of the babys mouth using an eyedropper or feeding syringe while he is at the breast.If baby becomes upset as you are trying, stop and attempt to calm him before trying again.These last ones pertain more to taking the shield away:It may help if you compress your breast and hold it firmly about 1 1/2 inches from the base of your nipple toward the chest wall (usually at the edge of the areola just past where your babys lips will be)  like squishing down a big thick sandwich on a roll to take a bite. Holding the breast this way makes your nipple more firm like the shield. Keep holding it like that until it feels like baby is sucking well, and then slowly release the grip.Apply ice to your nipple before feeding to harden it.Try to notice if there are certain times of the day or positions that he seems more receptive during and build on those.Try offering the breast without the nipple shield, particularly when baby is rather sleepy. Sometimes once they take the bare breast a couple times, theyll continue with no problems.If baby doesnt take the breast without the shield relatively easily, give it to him with the shield. DO NOT allow him to become frustrated at the breast, that will only make him more resistant to breastfeeding. Allow baby to build trust that nursing will work and will be ok, even if that means using the shield to make it familiar and easy for him. Once he builds trust, start to remove the shield after he has been on for awhileAfter baby is nursing well and let-down has occurred, attempt to remove the shield quickly and relatch baby. Very gradually, start to remove it earlier and earlier in the feeding until you dont need it at all.Sometimes it works to offer the first breast with the shield and the second one without it, if your baby takes both breasts in one feeding.In the beginning, you may not want to take away the shield at every feeding so the baby relaxes and doesnt look for you to remove it every time.You may hear the recommendation to cut away the tip of the nipple shield, a little each day, until its gone. This is not recommended for silicon shields, because it will leave sharp edges.Be sure not to make this a battle with the baby, or he will resist more. Dont obsess with weaning off the shield to the point that youre robbed of the joy of breastfeeding. As long as your baby is gaining weight well, then you have some time to play with. Keep trying as often as you can, and give it some time. There are some reports of moms continuing to use the shield for their whole breastfeeding experience, but most moms have taken anywhere from 2 days to about 4-5 weeks to accomplish completely weaning from the shield. Be patient with yourself and your baby while you work through this transition.Finding helpIf youre not already doing so, seriously consider contacting a lactation consultant (IBCLC) or an experienced breastfeeding counselorfor one-on-one support. It can be great help to talk to someone face-to-face.

My baby makes a clicking sound when nursing. Is this a problem?,http://kellymom.com/bf/concerns/child/clicking-when-nursing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC A clicking (or clucking or chucking) sound during nursing indicates                 that baby is repeatedly breaking the seal or suction. Try to notice when it occurs in the feeding. Is it more noticeable                 during let-down, or is it constant? Also try to notice if you have                 discomfort of any kind during the clicking. If the clicking causes discomfort or pain, or if baby is not gaining                 weight as expected, it would be a good idea to get an evaluation                 by an experienced lactation consultant. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Sometimes the click is normal and not an indication of a problem.                 Whatever the cause of the clicking, as long as baby is growing well                 and mom is comfortable (no nipple soreness or pain), dont worry                 about it.Some things that can cause clicking include: Engorgement can make latch on difficult and baby may have a hard time maintaining                 suction.Poor                 positioning and/or latch: for example, if baby is                 retracting the tongue or curling the tongue up when nursing, it                 can cause a clicking sound as the suction is broken. With poor positioning,                 baby may have a hard time maintaining a good seal at the breast.Breastmilk                 oversupply and/or fast let-down. Baby will often break suction                 if the milk is coming too fast for him to handle.Teething may be a cause of temporary clicking. If your baby has a sore mouth                 from the teething he may be trying to relieve it somewhat by not                 getting as tight of a seal around the breast or by repeatedly breaking                 the suction (thus the clicking). He could also be doing the same                 thing just because hes not yet used to the feel of teeth                 in his mouth when hes nursing.Ear                 infection could throw babys suck off                 temporarily. There is usually some pressure that builds in the ear                 when sucking and when there is ear pain, that pressure can be extremely                 uncomfortable. Baby may try to relieve it somewhat by not getting                 as tight of a seal around the breast or by repeatedly breaking the                 suction (thus the click). Thrush can make babys mouth sore or itchy, causing him to break suction.Babies who                 suck their tongues sometimes click. Such a baby is accustomed                 to the sensation of his own tongue up against the roof of his mouth                 and may latch too quickly with a shallow latch as soon as he senses                 something entering his mouth. Youll often see cheek dimpling when                 this sort of clicking is going on.Less commonly, anatomical                 variations in the infants oral cavity can cause clicking,                 if baby cannot get the nipple/breast fully into the mouth and compressed                 against the roof of the mouth. Examples include:Tongue tie/tight frenulum: A baby with tongue tie may be unable to keep the tongue extended for the relatively prolonged job of nursing, and thus the tongue will snap back when baby can no longer keep it in place. When he pulls the tongue back, suction is broken and you hear a click.  Highly-arched palate or other palate variations; Cleft of the soft palate; Unusually small or large tongue, etc.FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Toddler Words for Breastfeeding,http://kellymom.com/ages/after12mo/nursing-words/,"Words for NursingJordan AlexChildren use many different words for                 breastfeedingEncyclopaedia                 of Toddlers Breastfeeding Terms from Janes Breastfeeding &                 Childbirth Resources.Jordan Since Jordan has become verbal, her word for nursing has evolved.                 This has been pretty interesting (to her mama, at least) to observe,                 so Ive decided to record the progression of words. Nursing is still                 a pretty important part of this nursing toddlers life, so we hear                 it mentioned all the time. Im starting this little diary (of sorts)                 when Jordan is 18 months, and will add to it as needed.  about 10 months  Jordan starts talking (mama, kitty, rock).  12 months  She now says bop-bop-bop (for the boppy nursing                 pillow) when she wants to nurse. Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX. 13 months  Jordan occasionally says nuggle (snuggle                 is our word for nursing), but usually uses bop (or bop-bop or).  around 14 months  regularly uses nuggle when she wants                 to nurse. It took me a week or so to be able to consistently distinguish                 this from no. Bop is still used if she wants to nurse while                 lying down on the boppy.  17 months  nuggle-uggle (Jordan likes to play with word                 sounds!). She started pretend-play and often wants her favorite                 stuffed animals to snuggle, too. When she wants to nurse on the                 other side, she says ice (I assume this is her take on side).  18 months  Jordan mutters nuggle in her sleep when shes                 waking to nurse. If she doesnt latch on pretty quickly, she keeps                 repeating it (louder each time)  shes 98% asleep the whole time                 shes doing this. She still often says nuggle-uggle instead of                 nuggle (when shes awake). Jordan often hums while nursing  shes                 done this for months. Recently, she nursed to let-down, them pulled                 off, looked, and said (with a big grin) leak, leak, leak!  26 months  snuggle, snuggle-wuggle, and ice. Jordan                 will say, Mama, I need a snuggle! or Snuggle on the sofa (or                 wherever strikes her fancy). Sometimes when I ask her if she wants                 the boppy (we still use it), shell say No, just a snuggle!  32 months  Jordan still uses all the words above, but                 now often just says Mama, Im tired!  4 years old  Jordan has started calling it nursing                 part of the time now, but usually when shes talking about, not                 when she wants to do it. She will still say Im tired,                 when she wants to nurse, but shes almost weaned (on her own) and                 Im hearing it less and less nowadays. 4 1/2 years old  Jordan gradually cut out nursing before                 bed (she went to sleep without asking to nurse more and more), then                 gradually stopped asking to nurse when she woke up. In early June,                 when we visited her great-grandmother for a week, she only nursed                 twice. Then she nursed just a few last times about a week apart                 after we got back home. Since shes weaned, she started back to                 calling nursing snuggling again (I think Alex                 wants a snuggle!), or sometimes simply nursing.                 Her toy animals are always giving birth and nursing their babies                 :). Alex Alex has been much slower talking than Jordan was, so now (at                 17 months) hes still saying very little. He started using a few                 words by 12 months (mama, more, kitty) and around 14 months he started                 to call nursing/snuggling na or nana. He                 occasionally says na, but usually when he wants                 a snuggle, Alex simply crawls into my lap and pulls at my shirt;                 when he wants to change sides, he pats the other side. 22 months  Not much change here, but Ill update anyway                 :). At this point Alex often says na or nana                 when he wants to nurse. If Im working at the computer, he will                 get a boppy pillow and bring it to me. Sometimes he brings me two                 and wants them stacked up  he thinks this is really funny! 36 months  Alex has been calling nursing a                 (like the a sound in cat) for several months now. Im not sure                 where this came from, but it seems to have stuck! I still use na                 and snuggle but he doesnt usually use these words himself.                 By the way, hes been talking much more in the past month or two                  lots of sentences and a big vocabulary, but we still cant understand                 much of it. 39 months  Alexs language use has exploded and hes using                 lots of words and long, long sentences (though hes usually hard                 to understand still). He now usually uses his form of the word snuggle,                 which sounds like hug em. He likes to specify where                 he wants to nurse  I often hear hug em on the bed, Mama                 when hes sleepy. FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Teething,http://kellymom.com/ages/older-infant/teething/,"Teething is one of the most common causes of frequent night waking during the second six months and through the second year. It can also cause fussy nursing behavior, as some babies experience gum discomfort with sucking. Baby might start to nurse, but then pull off and cry or fuss and not want to nurse anymore. Other babies nurse nearly constantly because the nursing is soothing to them.Some things that help teething babies:Anesthetize babys gums with a frozen/refrigerated teething ring, or rub ice cube on his gums (you can even make a game of it). Try to get baby to nurse. If he pulls off/screams again, repeat the ice-rub.Put some crushed ice into a clean baby sock and tie off the top. Since it can mold around the gum, this is often helpful for painful teething. The fabric is easy and comfortable for baby to handle and babies like the texture of the fabric, too.Freeze or refrigerate a wet wash cloth for baby to chew on.Talk to your babys doctor about using a baby pain reliever 30-45 minutes before nursing.Some babies are helped by homeopathic teething tablets.Teething babies occasionally bite; if your baby bites, see When Baby Bites.Here are some tips in case baby refuses to nurse due to teething pain.Moms of teething babies sometimes getsore nipplesfrom babys gumming or chewing from discomfort (see above link on biting) or due to the increased saliva that comes with teething.Not recommended for teething:Do NOT use Orajel/benzocaine, viscous lidocaine, (or other topical anesthetics) in infants or young children, as there are serious health risks. In addition to the health dangers, this type of product can also numb babys mouth and make breastfeeding very difficult for baby. As of May 31, 2012, the US FDA recommends that parents and caregivers not use benzocaine products for children younger than 2 years, except under the advice and supervision of a health care professional, as their use can lead to a rare but very serious condition called methemoglobinemia.

Latch improved in all cases, and maternal pain levels fell significantly after the procedure Conclusion. Ankyloglossia is a relatively common finding in the newborn population and represents a significant proportion of breastfeeding problems. Poor infant latch and maternal nipple pain are frequently associated with this finding. Careful assessment of the lingual function, followed by frenuloplasty when indicated, seems to be a successful approach to the facilitation of breastfeeding in the presence of significant ankyloglossia.Messner AH, Lalakea ML, Aby J, Macmahon J, Bair E.

Will lying down to nurse cause ear infections?,http://kellymom.com/parenting/parenting-faq/ear-infection-nursing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCYou might hear that breastfeeding your baby in a lying down position will cause ear infections. Research indicates that this is not true. No matter what positioning you use, breastfeeding actually works to decrease the incidence of ear infections.This myth is one of many that has come from a mistaken application of bottle-feeding information to breastfeeding. There is good evidence that if baby is given a bottle of formula while lying flat, the formula can get into the Eustachian tubes and middle ear and cause an infection. However, there are two problems with applying this fact to breastfeeding: (1) breastmilk and formula are not the same  breastmilk inhibits the formation of bacteria, while formula encourages bacteria; and (2) breastfeeding and bottle feeding are not the same  milk does not pool in the mouth when baby is nursing, as as it does when baby drinks from a bottle.Also, keep in mind that with most nursing positions, baby is lying down while nursing anyway  whether mom is lying down or not!Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.So dont be afraid to lie down to nurse your baby.

What is a galactagogue? Do I need one?,http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/herbal_galactagogue/,"By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLCA substance that increases milk supply is called a galactagogue. Some of the most commonly used herbal galactagogues are fenugreek, blessed thistle, and alfalfa. There are also several prescription medications that can increase milk supply.Before you decide on any type of galactagogue, consider your reasons for doing so.Do you think that your milk supply is low? Why? Many moms think that they have a low milk supply even though their supply is just fine. Take a look at this information page on Increasing Low Milk Supply for more information on whether your supply is really low, and ways to increase your milk supply without herbs or medications.If you feel that your milk supply is truly low, then it will be very helpful to get in touch with a breastfeeding counselorand/or a board certified lactation consultant for one-on-one help for your particular situation.The average mother does not need galactagogues to increase or maintain supply.Following are examples of situations when galactagogue use may be useful:Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Some working mothers use herbs to increase their pumping output, even though their supply is fine when baby nurses.Some mothers with a genuinely low milk supply use galactagogues in combination with increased nursing/pumping to increase supply.Adoptive moms may use galactagogues to increase the amount of milk they are able to provide for their babies.The usual, non-herbal, non-medication methods for increasing milk supply are sufficient for most mothers.If the usual methods have not proven sufficient and you feel that a galactagogue is needed, keep these things in mind:Remember that any galactagogue will be most effective in increasing milk supply when combined with increased breastfeeding frequency and milk removal.Some types of galactagogues work better in particular situations and not in others. You should be working with someone who is knowledgable in their use.All of these galactagogues, whether herbal or prescription medication, have potential side effects and drug interactions that must be considered for each individual mother. You should talk to your health care provider and/or a knowledgableherbalist about whether a particular galactagogue is safe for you.Heres a bit of trivia: a number of the herbs and prescription medicines used for increasing milk supply also have uses related to digestive problems, for example, fenugreek, blessed thistle, fennel, alfalfa, metoclopramide and domperidone.Fenugreek Seed for Increasing Milk SupplyOatmeal for increasing milk supplyWhy you wont hear me suggestgalactagoguesby the Boob Geek, CLCFacebookPinterestTwitter"

How do I determine if a medication is safe for a breastfeeding mother?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/med-risks/,"Have you ever been told you need to stop breastfeeding because you need medical testing or a medication? Or told that you cannot receive treatment until you are done breastfeeding? The good news is thatmost medications are compatible with breastfeeding, and for those few medications that are a safety issue there are usually acceptable substitutions.Although mothers are frequently told they need to stop breastfeeding (temporarily or permanently)to take a medication, this is rarely necessary.According to Thomas Hale, RPh,PhD (Medications and Mothers Milk 2014, p. 7-12): It is generally accepted that all medications transfer into human milk to some degree, although it is almost always quite low. Only rarely does the amount transferred into milk produce clinically relevant doses in the infant Most importantly, it is seldom required that a breastfeeding mother discontinue breastfeeding just to take a medication. It is simply not acceptable for the clinician to stop lactation merely because of heightened anxiety or ignorance on their part. The risks of formula feeding are significant and should not be trivialized. Few drugs have documented side effects in breastfed infants, and we know most of these.These references areGOOD sources forinformation on medications and breastfeeding:Medications and Mothers Milkby Thomas Hale, RPh, PhD, is our favorite reference book and is updated every two years. This inexpensive reference is a must-have for anyone working with breastfeeding mothers, or breastfeeding mothers who frequently need information on medications.The InfantRisk Center(1-806-352-2519), headed by Dr. Thomas Hale in the US, has a phone helpline and additional information on medication use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.TheLactMed Database, afree online database maintained by the National Library of Medicine in the US, is a wonderfulonlineresourcefor information on breastfeeding and medications.If your health care provider does not know about this resource, spread the word!They also have afree smartphone appthat is very useful.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Drugs in Breastmilk (0844 412 4665), from The Breastfeeding Network in the UK, has a phone helpline and additional information on medication in breastfeeding mothers.Talking to babys health care provider (in addition to your own doctor) is also a good idea. Babys doctor will generally know more about the effects of medications on infants and young children, and whether a medication is typically given directly to infants or young children. Your babys doctor will also be aware of any particular health concerns that your baby has with respect to a particular medication.These references are NOT good sources for information on medications and breastfeeding:It is not appropriate to use pregnancy risk categories (A,B,C,D,X) to determine the risk of a drug to a breastfeeding mother and her baby, since the entry of drugs into human milk is quite different than the entry of drugs across the placenta during pregnancy.It is not uncommon to see doctors using the Physicians Desk Reference for information on medications and nursing. This reference contains the package inserts from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Almost across the board, they indicate that each medication should not be taken while pregnant or breastfeeding. The warning statements they use are designed to protect themselves from lawsuits. The information in the PDR is based on the manufacturers studies on the product, but not other studies that have been done. In general the manufacturers have done no studies on lactating women, and thus say that there is no information (even if studies have been done by others). Many doctors also have access to the USPDI (US Pharmacoepia Drug Information), which tends to have more accurate information than the PDR about studies done on the drug and available information about transfer into milk. If you dont have access to the gold standard references (above) on medications and breastfeeding, this reference is generally a better choice than the PDR.If someone suggests that you should stop breastfeeding while taking a certain medication, keep in mind that this is a cost-benefit decision the information available on the medication is not the only thing you need to take into account.When considering a medication (including herbal and other natural preparations) here are several factors to take into account:Does the mother need this medication/treatment right now, or is it something that she does not need or can easily postpone until her child is older?How old is the breastfeeding child? Is s/he healthy? Premature babies, newborns, and babies with health problems require somewhat more caution when it comes to the medications that the mother is taking; healthy older babies and toddlers are generally at a lesser risk since their bodies can metabolize medications more easily.How much breastmilk does the child get? A child who is getting smaller amounts of breastmilk (a newborn in the early days before mothers milk volume naturally increases, a baby or child who is eating other foods in addition to breastmilk and breastfeeds less often, etc.) will also be getting less of any medication that passes into breastmilk.Is the medication in question one with a record of safely being given directly to babies and young children? The amount of the medication that passes into breastmilk will normally be significantly lower than that given directly to young children.Avoid medications known to affect milk production.Temporary weaning is a risk to the mothersmilk supply. Milk supply may be compromised since pumps do not provide the same stimulation to supply as does a nursing baby. For the rare times when temporary weaning is needed, see this information onmaintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing.Temporary weaning comes with a risk that baby will not goback to the breast. Some babies have a hard time returning to breastfeeding after temporary weaning, and unfortunately we do not know ahead of time which babies will have problems.There areknown risks of formula feeding, including allergy, increased illness, etc. Many of the risks of formula feeding are not apparent for many years.If youre having problems finding the information you need, contact a local lactation consultant, or breastfeeding counselor.Looking for good medication resources in languages other than English?e-lactancia,afree online databasemaintained byAPILAM(Association for Promotion and Cultural and Scientific Research of Breastfeeding) inValencia, Spain, is another wonderful onlineresourcewith information on breastfeeding and medications, phytotherapy (plants), homeopathy and other alternative products, cosmetic and medical procedures, contaminants, and maternal/infant diseases.

Average Growth Patterns of Breastfed Babies,http://kellymom.com/health/growth/growthcharts/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCGrowth charts and breastfed baby growthA note about growth chartsGrowth chart comparisonsAdditional information and referencesGrowth charts and breastfed baby growthI have heard of many breastfed babies (including my own) whose doctor was disturbed at some point because the baby wasnt gaining weight quickly enough, even though the baby was well within the parameters for weight gain of breastfed babies. The problem is that many doctors are not familiar with the normal weight gain patterns of breastfed babies, and rely too much upon older growth charts that are based upon the growth of artificially fed babies.In 2006, the World Health Organization released revised growth charts that are representative of healthy breastfed babies throughout the world. Until doctors are familiar with them, we need to keep ourselves informed so that doctors dont undermine our confidence to breastfeed our babies.Healthy breastfed infants tend to grow more rapidly than their formula-fed peers in the first 2-3 months of life and less rapidly from 3 to 12 months. All growth charts available before 2006 (which are still used by many health care providers in the US) included data from infants who were not exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months (includes formula-fed infants and those starting solids before the recommended 6 months). Because many doctors are not aware of this difference in growth, they see the baby dropping in percentiles on the growth chart and often come to the faulty conclusion that the baby is not growing adequately. At this point they often recommend that the mother (unnecessarily) supplement with formula or solids, and sometimes recommend that they stop breastfeeding altogether. Even if mom realizes that her baby is perfectly healthy and doesnt follow these unnecessary recommendations, she ends up worrying for no reason (and moms dont need anything extra to worry about!).In February 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics, in their policy statement Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk, stated that Infant growth should be monitored with the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Curve Standards to avoid mislabeling infants as underweight or failing to thrive. The US Centers for Disease Control also recommend that the WHO growth charts be used for children age 0-2.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Even if a doctor is informed of the difference in growth patterns, she might not be willing to listen When I told my daughters pediatrician that I had read that breastfed babies gain weight slower than indicated by the growth charts, and asked what her thoughts were, she said that she didnt believe that it was true and continued to question my daughters weight. She refused to take a look at the article from Pediatrics [see reference below] that I brought to her office. I was rather surprised at this, since she had breastfed her own children. I ended up changing doctors, and my new doctor had no problem whatsoever with my daughters rate of weight gain.A note about growth chartsA growth chart isnt a test, where you are striving to get your baby into the 100th percentile. The growth charts show us the statistical distribution of weight, height , etc. in a particular set of babies (or children or adults). So if a baby is in the 50th percentile for weight on the CDC charts, it means that half of the healthy babies of the same age in the US are heavier and half are lighter; if a baby is in the 10th percentile for height, then 90% of babies of the same age in the US are taller and 10% are shorter. Healthy babies, just like adults, can come in all shapes and sizes  a baby in the 3rd percentile can be just as healthy and normal as a baby in the 97th percentile. What doctors are generally looking for on a growth chart is that baby stay relatively consistent in their growth pattern (see above for why this may not happen with earlier growth charts). Growth charts are only one part of the puzzle, however, and must be evaluated along with other factors, including:What size are babys parents? What were their growth patterns as babies? What about babys siblings or other family members? Genetics plays a large part in babys size, so dont ignore it.Is baby gaining consistently, even if its not on a curve?Is baby meeting developmental milestones on or near target?Is baby alert, happy, active?Is baby showing other signs of adequate milk intake?Growth Chart Comparisons[click for large version]Average Growth Patterns of Breastfed InfantsThe points plotted on the 2000 CDC Growth Charts represent preliminary WHO datafrom the average weight-for-age for a small set of infant boys and girls who werebreastfed for at least 12 months. Note how the growth of the healthy breastfed babies(plotted in red) appears to falter on the CDC growth charts. Im in the process of updatingthis graphic to show data from the finalized WHO charts.2000 US CDC Growth Charts:The US Centers for Disease Control revised their standard growth charts in 2000, based upon more recent data which are representative of the United States population, reflecting the Nations cultural and racial diversity.Per the CDC Growth Chart FAQ:Are these charts appropriate for exclusively breast-fed babies?The 2000 CDC growth charts can be used to assess the growth of exclusively breast-fed infants, however when interpreting the growth pattern one must take into account that mode of infant feeding can influence infant growth. In general, exclusively breast-fed infants tend to gain weight more rapidly in the first 2 to 3 months. From 6 to 12 months breast-fed infants tend to weigh less than formula-fed infants.The 2000 CDC Growth Chart reference population includes data for both formula-fed and breast-fed infants, proportional to the distribution of breast- and formula-fed infants in the population. During the past two decades, approximately one-half of all infants in the United States received some breast milk and approximately one-third were breast-fed for 3 months or more. A Working Group of the World Health Organization is collecting data at seven international study centers to develop a new set of international growth charts for infants and preschoolers through age 5 years. These charts will be based on the growth of exclusively or predominantly breast-fed children.1977 Growth Charts:The 1977 growth charts for babies under 2 years old were based on a study conducted in Ohio from 1929 to 1975. The babies in this study:were primarily fed formula or a combination of breastmilk and formulaoften started solids before 4 monthsAs a result, the 1977 growth charts are not a reliable indicator of the growth of children who:are breastfed onlydelay solids until around six months, as is now recommended by many health organizationsHow well do the 2000 CDC Growth Charts estimate growth of breastfed babies?de Onis and Onyango (2003) used weight and length measurements from a sample of 226 healthy breastfed infants to evaluate the new 2000 CDC Growth Charts and the National Center for Health Statistics/World Health Organization (NCHS/WHO) growth reference. They found that there were notable differences in the growth trajectory of breastfed infants and concluded that A reference based on healthy breastfed infants is required if the growth patterns of infants following international feeding recommendations are to be correctly assessed.

Is Baby Getting Enough Milk?,http://kellymom.com/bf/got-milk/supply-worries/enough-milk/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCIS BABY GETTING ENOUGH?  QUICK REFERENCE CARD~~~ BIRTH to 6 WEEKS ~~~WEIGHT GAIN:If baby is gaining well on moms milk alone, then baby is getting enough. A 5-7% weight loss during the first 3-4 days after birth is normal. Baby should regain birth weight by 10-14 days. By day 5, average weight gain is 2/3-1 oz per day (5-7 oz/week). If these goals are not met, call your lactation consultant. More on weight gain.WET DIAPERS: 6+ wet diapers per day (by day 4).Expect one wet diaper on day one, increasing to 6+ by day 4. To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of water into a clean diaper (if baby wets more often, then the amount of urine per diaper may be less). Urine should be pale and mild smelling.DIRTY DIAPERS: 3  4+ dirty diapers per day (by day 4).Stools should be yellow (no meconium) by day 5 and the size of a US quarter (2.5 cm) or larger. The normal stool of a breastfed baby is usually yellow and is loose (soft to watery, may be seedy or curdy). More on infant stooling.OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS: After a feeding, moms breast feels softer and baby seems reasonably content.

Breastfeeding and Guilt,http://kellymom.com/bf/advocacy/bf_and_guilt_01-00/,"Written by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC  (revised January 2000)One of the most powerful arguments many health professionals, government                 agencies and formula company manufacturers make for not promoting                 and supporting breastfeeding is that we should not make the                 mother feel guilty for not breastfeeding. Even some strong                 breastfeeding advocates are disarmed by this not making mothers                 feel guilty ploy. It is, in fact, nothing more than a ploy. It is an argument that                 deflects attention from the lack of knowledge and understanding                 of too many health professionals about breastfeeding. This allows them not to feel guilty for their ignorance of how to help                 women overcome difficulties with breastfeeding, which could have                 been overcome and usually could have been prevented in the first                 place if mothers were not so undermined in their attempts to breastfeed.                 This argument also seems to allow formula companies and health professionals                 to pass out formula company literature and free samples of formula                 to pregnant women and new mothers without pangs of guilt, despite                 the fact that it has been well demonstrated that this literature                 and the free samples decrease the rate and duration of breastfeeding. Lets look at real life. If a pregnant woman went to her physician                 and admitted she smoked a pack of cigarettes, is there not a strong                 chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty for endangering                 her developing baby? If she admitted to drinking a couple of beers                 every so often, is there not a strong chance that she would leave                 the office feeling guilty? If a mother admitted to sleeping in the                 same bed with her baby, would most physicians not make her feel                 guilty for this even though it is, in fact, the best thing for her                 and the baby? If she went to the office with her one week old baby                 and told the physician that she was feeding her baby homogenized                 milk, what would be the reaction of her physician? Most would practically                 collapse and have a fit. And they would have no problem at all making                 that mother feel guilty for feeding her baby cows milk, and then                 pressuring her to feed the baby formula. (Not pressuring her to                 breastfeed, it should be noted, because you wouldnt want                 to make a woman feel guilty for not breastfeeding.)Why such indulgence for formula? The reason of course, is that                 the formula companies have succeeded so brilliantly with their advertising                 to convince most of the world that formula feeding is just about                 as good as breastfeeding, and therefore there is no need to make                 such a big deal about women not breastfeeding. As a vice-president                 of Nestle here in Toronto was quoted as saying Obviously,                 advertising works. It is also a balm for the consciences of                 many health professionals who, themselves, did not breastfeed, or                 their wives did not breastfeed. I will not make women feel                 guilty for not breastfeeding, because I dont want to feel guilty                 for my child not being breastfed.Lets look at this a little more closely. Formula is certainly                 theoretically more appropriate for babies than cows milk. But,                 in fact, there are no clinical studies that show that there is any                 difference between babies fed cows milk and those fed formula.                 Not one. Breastmilk, and breastfeeding, which is not the same as                 breastmilk feeding, has many many more theoretical advantages over                 formula than formula has over cows milk (or other animal milk).                 And we are just learning about many of these advantages. Almost                 every day there are more studies telling us about these theoretical                 advantages. But there is also a wealth of clinical data showing                 that, even in affluent societies, breastfed babies, and their mothers,                 incidentally, are much better off than formula fed babies. They                 have fewer ear infections, fewer gut infections, a lesser chance                 of developing juvenile diabetes and many other illnesses. The mother                 has a lesser chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and                 is probably protected against osteoporosis. And these are just a                 few examples.So how should we approach support for breastfeeding? All pregnant                 women and their families need to know the risks of artificial feeding.                 All should be encouraged to breastfeed, and all should get the best                 support available for starting breastfeeding once the baby is born.                 Because all the good intentions in the world will not help a mother                 who has developed terribly sore nipples because of the babys poor                 latch at the breast. Or a mother who has been told, almost always                 inappropriately, that she must stop breastfeeding because of some                 medication or illness in her or her baby. Or a mother whose supply                 has not built up properly because she was given wrong information.                 Make no mistake about ithealth professionals advice is                 often the single most significant reason for mothers failing at                 breastfeeding! Not the only one, and other factors are important,                 but health professionals often have influence and authority far                 beyond their knowledge and experience. If mothers get the information about the risks of formula feeding                 and decide to formula feed, they will have made an informed decision.                 This information must not come from the formula companies themselves,                 as it often does. Their pamphlets give some advantages of breastfeeding                 and then go on to imply that their formula is almost, well, between                 us, actually, just as good. If mothers get the best help possible                 with breastfeeding, and find breastfeeding is not for them, they                 will get no grief from me. It is important to know that a woman                 can easily switch from breastfeeding to bottle feeding. In the first                 days or weeksno big problem. But the same is not true for                 switching from bottle feeding to breastfeeding. It is often very                 difficult or impossible, though not always. Finally, who does feel guilty about breastfeeding? Not the women                 who make an informed choice to bottle feed. It is the woman who                 wanted to breastfeed, who tried, but was unable to breastfeed who                 feels guilty. In order to prevent women feeling guilty about not                 breastfeeding what is required is not avoiding promotion of breastfeeding,                 but promotion of breastfeeding coupled with good, knowledgeable                 and skillful support. This is not happening in most North American                 or European societies. FacebookPinterestTwitter"

Study shows obesity in infants can be diagnosed at 6 months,http://kellymom.com/blog-post/study-shows-obesity-in-infants-can-be-diagnosed-at-6-months/,"Study shows obesity in infants can be diagnosed at 6  monthsBy analyzing the electronic medical records of babies seen for routine  well-child visits to the UTMB pediatric clinic, the investigators  found that about 16 percent of 6-month-olds fit the studys criterion  for obesity  a weight-for-length ratio that put them in the top 5  percent of all babies in their age group. (Weight for length was used  instead of the conventional body mass index because BMI is based on  weight and height as measured while standing, which neither 6-month-olds  nor 24-month-olds can do well enough to measure.) Further analysis of  the records indicated that obese 2-year-olds were much more likely to  have been obese at 6 months than 2-year-olds who were not obese.Heres the actual study: McCormick DP,  Sarpong K, Jordan L, Ray LA, Jain S. Infant Obesity: Are  We Ready to Make this Diagnosis? J Pediatr. 2010 Mar 23. [Epub ahead of  print].Regarding breastfeeding, meta-analyses have shown a 15% to 25%  reduction in obesity risk at school age with early breastfeeding  compared with formula feeding.  Our data report a trend for prolonged  breastfeeding to be associated with healthy weight status at age 24  months, but the numbers of breast feeders to age 6 months in our  population are small. Some records did not note breastfeeding status  because some subjects data were entered on our EMR for the first time  at their 6-month visit.Of the  obese children in the study, 31% were never breastfed (vs 24% of the healthy weight  children) and only 11% were breastfed past 6 months (vs 21% of the  healthy weight children). The breastfeeding status of  38% of the obese children (and 34% of the healthy weight  children) was unknown.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Do you have a big exclusively breastfed baby?kellymom.com :: Is my  exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?It is normal for breastfed babies to gain  weight more rapidly than their formula-fed peers during the first 2-3  months and then taper off (particularly between 9 and 12 months).

My baby fusses or cries when breastfeeding – what’s the problem?,http://kellymom.com/hot-topics/fussy-while-nursing/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC Lsantilli - Fotolia.comSome babies will fuss, cry or pull off the breast during breastfeeding. There are a number of reasons why this might be happening. Its pretty common to see this type of behavior at around 6-8 weeks, though it can occur at any time. If your baby is generally fussy (not just when nursing) see My baby is fussy! Is something wrong? Determining the problemHere are some of the problem-solving steps I go through when my baby is fussy at the breast or a mother asks me why her baby is fussing while breastfeeding:How old is baby? Most babies go through growth spurts during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, etc. Many babies are fussy during growth spurts.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Is baby working on anything new developmentally? Babies who are starting to notice the world around them can be notoriously distractible. Any kind of new developmental step that baby is working on can affect nursing temporarily, whether it be fussy nursing behavior or simply more frequent nursing.When is baby fussing? To figure out the cause its helpful to pay attention to when the fussy behavior happens, both during the nursing session and during the day.If baby is fussy right when your milk is letting down (or immediately after), theres a good chance that the fussy nursing is related to a fast let-down. If baby is fussy before let-down, or a few minutes into nursing (and a while after let-down), then baby may be impatient for the fast flow of milk that comes with let-down. Fussing at the end of a nursing session (or what seems to be the end) may mean that baby needs to burp, or is ready to finish nursing, or just wants to suck (and doesnt want to deal with a new let-down at this point), or wants to continue nursing on the other side or with a faster flow of milk.If the fussy behavior is mainly in the mornings, it might be due to a faster than usual let-down if baby has just had a longer sleep period and moms breasts are fuller than usual. If baby is fussier during evening nursings, it may be due to the normal fussy time that most babies have during the evening. Although most babies dont react to foods that mom eats, some do. If you eat a particular food at about the same time each day (or most days) and baby has a regular time where she fusses during nursing, try not eating that food for a week or two to see if things improve.Does fussing occur on both sides equally or only on one side? Most moms have a faster let-down and/or a more abundant milk supply on one side than the other, so if your baby fusses more on one side, it may be due to these differences.What else is going on with baby? Is she sick or teething? Is something new or different going on in her environment? Has she started solids or is she trying a new food? Is she exhibiting other symptoms besides the fussy nursing? Below are discussions of some of the different things that can lead to fussy nursing behavior. Keep in mind that the problem may also be a combination of several things.Does baby need to burp?Many babies will cry, fuss, pull off the breast, etc. if they need to burp. Try to burp between breasts and after a feeding, but dont worry if baby does not burp and is content. Breastfed babies overall dont take in as much air during a feeding as bottle-fed babies do, so usually dont need to burp as often. If baby has been crying before she nurses, or is so hungry that she nurses frantically or if mom has a fast let-down, baby could be taking in more air and may need to be burped more often.Burping is usually only necessary during the first few months, though it may extend longer. Once your baby is moving more freely, she will be able to relieve the gastric gas herself. This usually will occur between the 4th and 6th month, but may be shorter in some children and longer in others.If baby has a hard time burping, try burping more often during a feeding. The best burping position is one that applies firm pressure to the babys tummy. Placing baby over the shoulder way up so that there is pressure on babys abdomen often works well. Walking around while doing this might distract her long enough to get a good burp. You may even want to lie baby down on her stomach and burp her that way. Growth spurtBabies often pull off and fuss during growth spurts. Most babies go through growth spurts, sometimes called frequency days, during the first few days at home and around 7-10 days, 2-3 weeks, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 6 months and 9 months (more or less). More growth spurt information in this link. Distractible babyIf baby seems to be pulling off the breast at any distraction (real or imaginary), then see The Distractible Baby. Forceful let-downSome babies will pull off the breast soon after let-down if mom has a forceful let-down. Baby may be frustrated by the too-fast flow of milk with let-down. A too-forceful let-down can also cause excessive gas or spitting up/vomiting. There is more information here on symptoms of and how to deal with a fast let-down reflex. Slow let-downSome babies get very impatient if mom has a slow let-down. There is more information here on speeding up a slow let-down reflex. Baby wants a faster milk flowEven very young babies can be quick to notice that pulling off, kneading the breast, etc. can cause an additional let-down, and can facilitate a faster, easier milk flow. Some babies become impatient with the slower milk flow following the initial fast flow at let-down. This may or may not be related to a slow let-down.When a feeding begins at the breast there are drops of milk. Then when the initial let-down occurs (several seconds to a minute into the feeding), the milk flow speeds up quite a bit. At that time it may drip very quickly, squirt, or even spray. Some minutes later it slows again and the baby must continue to suck vigorously in order to elicit further let-downs. This pattern can continue through successive, multiple let-downs as long as the baby is continuing to nurse vigorously. Eventually, baby will learn that the flow will pick back up again if shell only continue to vigorously suck/swallow.With bottle feeding, the flow is instant and continuous. The baby is required to work very little. Once a baby has had a bottle, especially a lot of bottles, she may begin to prefer the ease of bottle-feeding over the work of breastfeeding. She may become frustrated at the breast after the first let-down occurs and the flow of milk begins to slow.If baby is getting bottles you might consider putting them away, at least for a while. When you must use a bottle, only use a newborn nipple for as long as baby will tolerate it so that she never gets a really fast flow of milk from the bottle, but has to work a little more to get the milk.Sometimes babies of moms with oversupply or fast let-down will also get very used to the fast flow and object when it normally slows somewhere between 3 weeks to 3 months.It can be helpful to do some breast compression when this fussiness starts or right before you expect it to. This will help speed up the milk flow again. Once compression stops helping, try switching baby to the other side when she begins to fuss and back and forth again (after using compression) as you need to. Baby is done nursing for the momentIf baby is fussing after shes been nursing for a while, and youve ruled out other causes, she may be in the process of changing her nursing pattern. Babies become very efficient at the breast with growth and maturity. They can milk the breast in a lot less time per feeding session than they required before. Babys frustration may just be a sign that shes finished and wants to move on.On a similar note, an occasional baby will just want to suck at the end of a nursing session and the flow of milk with let-down frustrates her. You might see if offering her a finger or pacifier (if baby is older than 4-6 weeks) to suck on during these times seems to help. Baby prefers one sideSometimes babies will refuse or fuss at a breast when the let-down is slower or too forceful, or the supply a bit lower. They in turn will prefer the side which lets down more/less quickly and in which the supply is more bountiful. See also: Lopsided! What can I do?Fussy in the eveningMany young babies tend to pull off and fuss at the breast in the evening. See the article Cluster Feeding and Fussy Evenings. TeethingTeething can cause fussy nursing behavior, as some babies experience gum discomfort with sucking. Baby might start to nurse, but then pull off and cry or fuss and not want to nurse anymore. See Teething for more information and tips. ThrushFrequent pulling off the breast can be a symptom of thrush. Stuffy noseA stuffy nose can cause fussy nursing behavior. If your baby has a stuffy nose and is having a hard time breathing and nursing at the same time, see colds & congestion. Allergy or food sensitivitySome babies with allergies or food sensitivities exhibit fussy nursing behavior. Often when there is a sensitivity to something in moms diet, baby will come to the breast hungry but when she tastes/smells something in the milk that will cause her GI distress, she pulls off, bats her head back and forth, etc. Sensitivities to foods in moms diet are rare. If this is the problem, you will most likely notice other symptoms, such as excessive spitting up or vomiting, colic, diarrhea, rash, persistent congestion or runny nose, or excessive gas. More information on food sensitivities in babies and links to more allergy information can be found in my article Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies.

TIMEs AP moms take your questions.9. How did you feel about the way extended breastfeeding was portrayed on the cover of TIME? Igor Yaruta - Fotolia.comJessica ____________________It didnt portray breastfeeding the way it naturally occurs  in a nurturing, snuggly way. Though, I certainly have seen older kids standing up nursing while their moms are busy talking to me or others around her. As far as how it was publicly portrayed before  was it?!One of the producers at ABCs Nightline said to me during my interview, I dont think the uproar would have happened if the mom had been breastfeeding a six month old. My response: Maybe. But I cant recall ever seeing a mom nursing a child of ANY age on the cover of a national magazine. We see breasts on lots of other magazine covers, mainly to sell products. We never get to see breasts as what they are  mammary glands that nourish our babies.Now infants can getall their vitamin Dfrom their mothers milk;no drops needed withour sponsor'sTheraNatal Lactation ONEby THERALOGIX.Jamie ____________________Awkward is the only term that really expresses that picture for me. I was there, so I know what they were going for (confidence and contentment), and it was not conveyed in that picture. I am not thrilled with the shot of me, but my biggest problem is with my son and his body language in the photo. I see his expression and arm placement as completely disconnected, which made the photo a poor representation of what breastfeeding really is past infancy (connectedness, comfort, and lovenot to mention the antibodies and nutrients they are getting in the breast milk).I have no problem nursing standing up (we have definitely done it at homein fact, we did it today!)  I thought that standing would help show how infant breastfeeding is different than toddler breastfeeding (the majority of people seem not to understand that). What they were looking for is playfulness, confidence, contentment, and always nurturing in the pose. Do you see that in this photo? I dont. They definitely have those shots and I feel they lost an opportunity to educate by choosing an outtake rather than one of the pictures we worked so hard to get.Melinda ____________________I personally would have chosen a different headline and picture to represent extended breastfeeding because of what it means to me, but no matter how loving you make it those who disagree will disagree.Dionna ____________________During the photo shoot, Martin Schoeller (the photographer for TIME) asked us to look confident, assured. The photos he had up as inspiration were all very maternal in appearance. I do feel that Jamie looked confident and assured in her picture, but the pose was not one that I felt anyone looked for during the entire shoot.Regardless of the pose itself, I am glad that breastfeeding an older child was shown on the cover. Breastfeeding past infancy is normal, natural, and healthy, whether your child is three weeks old or three years old.<<<< Previous | Continue to Part 10 >>>>FacebookPinterestTwitter"
Breastfeeding Logs,http://kellymom.com/ages/newborn/bf-basics/bf-logs/,"By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLCUnder normal circumstances it is not necessary to use a breastfeeding log. However, some mothers feel more comfortable in the beginning if they are keeping track of nursings and diapers. Most mothers will benefit from the safety net of using a log for the first week or so until they and their babys health care provider are reassured that breastfeeding is going well and that babys weight gain pattern is adequate.After the initial week or so, a log can be used to document feedings and diapers if any concerns arise.In addition to providing an easy-to-use form for keeping track of how often your baby nurses and has wet/dirty diapers, the professional version of these printable logs discusses what to expect in the early weeks of breastfeeding.
