7 Ways to Improve Your Nutrition When You're Expecting,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/ways-improve-nutrition-when-youre-expecting/,"No two diets are alike, but dont let that get in the way of  healthy nutrition while youre expecting . After all, eating well is one of the best ways to give your baby a head start in life  and it can make your pregnancy go more smoothly, too. Want to know how to consume whats best whether you chow down on the go, know you could make some tweaks to your food habits or pride yourself on the choices you already make? Answer the following questions and get the tasty  and simple  tips that can make a huge difference. What do you eat before you head out in the morning? A cereal bar or yogurt as I bolt out the door.  The good news about those on-the-go options is that they provide fiber and calcium. The not-so-great news: They also typically contain a lot of sugar (and calories). Two healthier solutions that are just as easy to grab: Fill snack bags with bite-sized, unsweetened whole-grain cereal and keep mini containers of low-fat or nonfat Greek yogurt in the fridge. Full of protein, vitamin D, iron and choline, hard-boiled eggs are another great grab-and-go breakfast. A bagel calms my queasy stomach.  Morning sickness can make the morning rush even harder to handle, so it's smart to put something in your belly to ease the quease. But you'll have more energy and give your baby more nutrients if you make that bagel whole wheat or toast up a fiber-rich whole-grain English muffin. Add a dose of protein by spreading it with almond butter. This complex-carb-and-protein combo might do a better job on your queasiness, plus you'll feel fuller longer. A bowl of oatmeal or cereal with fruit, sometimes a scrambled egg.  Kudos for managing to make morning meals a priority  and working in so many good-for-baby food groups. To make the most of your already healthy breakfast, always choose whole-grain cereal, low-fat or nonfat Greek yogurt (it has more protein than regular yogurt), and oatmeal without added sugar. And make sure the eggs are fully cooked now that you're pregnant. What's your a.m. beverage of choice? No doubt about it: coffee.  It's fine to down a cup of joe to start your engine, but do stick to the expert-sanctioned rule of no more than 200 mg (or two cups) of  caffeine  a day. Need more energy? Pair your morning mug with a complex-carb-and-protein combo like whole-wheat toast and cheese. A glass of OJ gives me an energy boost.  OJ contains energy-boosting electrolytes and vitamin C, which helps shore up your immune system and aid iron absorption. Just remember there's a lot of natural sugar in orange juice, so consider swapping it for a whole fiber-rich orange some days. Or add some lower-sugar juices into your daily mix, like a combo of lemon, lime and grapefruit. I go for a tall glass of skim milk.  You're smart to start the day with a glass of milk since you need four servings of dairy daily to build your baby's bones  and protect yours. For a weekend treat, try a fruit smoothie made with skim milk or low-fat yogurt  you'll get your calcium plus fiber and phytonutrients. What do you do when lunchtime rolls around? I make a beeline for the drive-through  its quick!  Fast food is definitely convenient when you're on the run, but most fast-food options just aren't good for you or your baby  too much fat, salt, sugar and calories. Try to limit drive-through days, and when you do go, consider healthier picks like a grilled chicken sandwich or salad (with dressing on the side). One way to cut back on your fast-food habit: Prep tomorrow's lunch the night before, so brown-bagging becomes less of a chore. I zap a frozen meal and eat it at my desk. Frozen meals have come a long way but can still be loaded with fat and salt (and be short on fiber), so read those labels and choose carefully. Try creating your own (much healthier) freezer meals by combining frozen vegetables and pre-cooked shrimp or chicken breast (all available in grocery stores) and making a double-portion stir-fry  one serving for tonight's dinner, the other for tomorrow's lunch. I dig into a homemade sandwich. Bravo for choosing a hearty roll rather than rolling on up to the drive-through. But that sandwich is only as good as its buns and what's between 'em. Always choose whole-grain bread for an extra dose of B vitamins (good for building your baby's nervous system). Take a pass on super-salty cold cuts and high-fat mayo, both of which carry the risk of food-borne illness if the sandwich sits out for a while. Some safer yet still savory options: sliced (homemade or low-sodium) turkey or chicken breast with mustard or hummus or grilled veggies layered with reduced-fat mozzarella. What are you nibbling during your 4:00 slump? Chips or cookies  theyre what I crave and Im allowed some extra calories now.  Yes, you need an extra 300 calories each day to feed your growing baby, but swap that junk for something more nutritious. Try satisfying your afternoon snack attack with a container of fat-free chocolate pudding (and get a little calcium while you do). If salt's what you crave, go for air-popped popcorn sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Im happy with my three-square meals.  Three squares are fine if your energy's not flagging, but you might need a little more steam to power through your day right now. One strategy: Try switching to five or six mini-meals, including a few carb-protein combos like trail mix with nuts or a mini-container of cottage cheese with a spoonful of granola. Smaller, more frequent meals may also help with heartburn. When Im hungry, I reach for fruit, carrot sticks or a granola bar.  Those carrots are full of vitamin A  good for building your baby's eyesight and bones. And fruit is a great source for vitamin C, which helps your body absorb iron  you'll need a lot to generate the blood cells to grow a baby. Maybe toss some dried fruit or soy chips into the mix, both good sources of fiber and iron  and make sure those granola bars aren't loaded with sugar (most are). When you make dinner, which style best describes you? Im the takeout queen.  Too busy to cook most nights? That's okay, but remember: Takeout meals can be high in calories and fat and low on nutrition. A better plan: When you've got some time, cook up a big batch of turkey chili, chicken soup or other easy-to-freeze meals so you control the ingredients. And when you do order in, try to go for lean protein, a solid serving of veggies or salad, and some whole grains, like brown rice. Im a comfort-food cook.  Pregnancy symptoms like nausea and heartburn might make you yearn for comfort food, but those are typically heavy on fat and calories. Look for ways to make your favorite recipes skinnier and more nutritious  try skim milk instead of whole in your mac 'n' cheese and toss in some cauliflower or peas. Use low-fat cheddar in your tuna casserole, and opt for ground turkey instead of beef meatballs when you're in the mood for marinara. Craving something mashed? Swap sweet potatoes for white and skip the butter  add a little orange juice and cinnamon and you're set. Im a health-food lover.  Since you're already a healthy eater, no need to reinvent the dinnertime wheel. Just up your intake of nutrients that are good for your baby, like omega-3 fats found in salmon, sardines and walnuts. More ways to boost your omega-3 intake at any meal: Use extra-virgin olive oil on your sauts and salads, sprinkle flaxseed on your oatmeal and opt for omega-3-enriched eggs. What's your evening snack of choice? I love a bowl of ice cream or cookie.  Treats are fine (and ice cream does have calcium), but a nightly dose of sweets is a surefire way to gain more weight than you should. Instead of that cookie, pop a square of dark chocolate, which contains natural stress-busters to help balance pregnancy-induced mood swings. Another cool snack that'll satisfy a sweet tooth: frozen red grapes  they taste just like candy. I relax with a cup of tea.  The benefits of tea are well known, but when you're expecting, you need to be wary of what's in your cup. Black, green, white and oolong teas all contain anywhere from 26 to 48 mgs of caffeine per eight-ounce cup. As for herbal teas, check in with your ob-gyn or midwife to learn  which are safe . Or steep a little fresh ginger (a tried-and-true morning-sickness soother) and a couple of cloves in a steaming mug of water, then strain them out and sip away. Just a glass of water.  That glass of water is a smart move since you need to up your fluid intake during pregnancy. Drinking water regularly helps relieve symptoms of morning sickness and heartburn as well as constipation. If the need to pee is interfering with your nightly z's, try drinking more during the day and less in the evening. Want to add a hint of flavor and extra nutrients to your H20? Freeze berries in your ice cubes. What foods never make it onto your plate? Fish  ugh!  Lots of people don't dig fish, but seafood can be a great source of protein and iron, important nutrients for your growing bundle. Plus, the omega-3 fatty acids in salmon and halibut can promote your baby's brain development. But some types of seafood (shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish) may contain high levels of mercury and  should be avoided , especially by expectant moms. The bottom (fishing) line: Try to get fish on your menu at least a couple of times a month  even canned (or pouched) light tuna counts. Vegetables  meat and pasta are what I crave.  While meat and grains can raise your stores of zinc, iron and folate, both you and your baby will miss out on a bevy of vitamins if you always skip the veggies. You really should eat three to four servings daily (beans count), so try to find ways to up your intake. Toss a salad with chopped carrots, black beans, spinach and roasted red peppers. Use whole grains like couscous and quinoa as a nutrient-rich base for any vegetables you like, whether raw, steamed, sauted or roasted. Meat  Im a vegan. You don't have to be a meat eater  to be a healthy mother-to-be, but you do need to make sure you're getting those extra calories, protein, vitamins and minerals from other food sources like nuts, beans and soy products. (Greens, potatoes, pasta and corn are also protein providers.) Meat-free sources of iron include whole grains, dried beans, dark-green leafy vegetables and dried fruits. Be sure to include foods rich in vitamin C in your diet every day, which will help your body absorb iron.

Parents' Job Stress Can Lead to Poorer Nutrition for Kids,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/family-life/0703/parents--job-stress-can-lead-to-poorer-nutrition-for-kids.aspx,"As if job stress isn't enough to give parents a headache, now you need to worry that your job stress is causing your children to have poorer nutrition than children whose parents are not stressed about their jobs. A new study shows that parents with work-related stress are more likely to serve their children unhealthy food than other parents, according to  HealthDay . Researchers collected data from more than 3,700 families: The results showed that those parents whose jobs create stress are less likely to feed their children nutritious meals or encourage good nutrition. Moreover, parents whose jobs are stressful are more likely to feed their families fast food and serve fewer servings of fruit and vegetables to their children. Parents with less stressful jobs, or no jobs, fed their children an average of 5.5 healthy meals per week, while stressed parents only fed their children four healthy meals per week. Essentially, parents with stressful jobs allow their stress to interfere with their family's healthy eating habits.       Melanoma Therapy    Get the Facts on Advanced Melanoma & a Treatment Option that May Help.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com               ""Work stress can affect many areas of daily life, including meal times and quality,"" said Dr. Alice Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science policy at Tufts University. She agreed with the researchers that poorer nutrition for children of working parents with stress is fixable if children learn to help prepare meals to make sure that the family eats a more nutritious, healthier diet. I'm not surprised by this. My husband has an important job, and I work from home, which is stressful enough. There are times when I'm tempted to call my husband when he's on his way home from work and ask him to stop and pick up something for dinner. Fortunately, I don't give in to this temptation too often, because I don't feel good when I eat unhealthy foods. What I've learned as a parent is that sometimes you have to cut corners to make things work. We do occasionally order a pizza for dinner or run into Publix for a sub. However, most of the time we feel too overwhelmed by life to cook a  healthy meal , and so we compromise. My husband will run into the store and pick up a roasted chicken from the deli, and we will steam some broccoli, heat up some rice, and call it a meal. When we want something sweet, we dip strawberries in melted dark chocolate, which feels so much healthier than ice cream. How well do you feed your kids on busy nights?

Tips for Handling Toddler Food Rejection,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/eating-and-nutrition/tips-for-handling-toddler-food-rejection/,"It's the rare toddler who loves everything at first bite. It often takes five, 10, even  15  attempts before your budding gourmand accepts (and swallows) a new food. Remember, you're not only dealing with super-sensitive taste buds but also with a growing desire to be assertive (you can put it on my plate, Mom, but you can't make me eat it!). Fortunately, almost all toddlers will eat when they're really hungry, but while you're waiting, here are some tactics for feeding your finicky one. In This Series   toddler Whole and Organic Food for Toddlers   toddler Family Meals   toddler The Toddler Diet: Flexible Feeding   toddler Vegetables for Toddlers   toddler Toddler Drinks: Limit the Liquids   toddler Recommended Carbs for Toddlers Go with the flow.  Toddlers usually need to give food a full examination before they taste it. They'll touch and mash and sniff it before it actually makes it into their mouths. Don't let it get to you. The more matter-of-fact you are about foods (and eating), the less likely your toddler will be to turn mealtime into mayhem. Start small . Sometimes size matters. A mountain of food (no matter what food) can overwhelm a little eater  causing her to give up before she's started. Keeping portions small will make it easier to negotiate. Come back with combos.  Some toddlers reject new foods simply because they're not bland enough. In that case, try adding a little bit of the new, more flavorful food to a bland one she already likes (for instance, add a touch of peas to her brown rice). Gradually add more, until you can serve each separately. And just so you know: Almost all kids outgrow ultra-sensitive palates. Switch gears.  You never know what'll tickle a toddler's taste buds  or turn her stomach. Sometimes even favorite foods suddenly get the ick-treatment. In that case, try serving it in a different dish or using a new spoon, or preparing it hot instead of cold, dry instead of with milk, as a finger food instead of spoon-fed, or grated with cheese instead of plain. The point is to do whatever it takes (within reason) to pique her interest and get her to gobble it up. Fork it over.  Boost your toddler's budding independence and fine motor skills by giving her a set of her own kid-size utensils. You just might find that the novelty of feeding herself outweighs her impulse to reject her meal. Try family style . Eating as a family may encourage your toddler to eat more adventurously. Pass around a bowl of pasta with veggies and pesto or a plate of teriyaki salmon and brown rice, and you may be surprised to see your tot reach for a taste. Give it a break . Matter-of-factly take the rejected food away, and don't serve it up  or bring it up  for at least a week (unless it's asked for). In the meantime, offer nutritionally similar foods  if it's frozen waffles that have gotten the cold shoulder, serve pancakes. If it's yogurt, try cottage cheese. If it's apples, try bananas. Do bring it back with a twist . When you return the rejected food to the menu, serve it with a different spin. Cereal for lunch instead of for breakfast. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich rolled up and cut into pinwheels instead of standard squares. Grilled cheese made with mozzarella cheese instead of American. Don't write off rejected foods . What's off the menu today may be back on tomorrow, so don't give up (yet). If fact, if a food strike is triggered by teething discomfort or a soon-to-appear cold, it may be back in favor once your little one is feeling like her usual self.

Is Homemade Baby Food Really Healthier for Infants?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/homemade-baby-food-healthier-infants/,"Between the planning, meal prep, work it requires to cook it to babys liking, babys picky appetite and babys tendency to put much of their food anywhere except in their mouths, its not surprising many parents dont crank out babys meals in-house themselves. But a new study published in the  International Journal of Obesity  is saying homemade baby food is the way to go. In fact, it may even produce leaner babies with more diverse diets than store-bought baby food. What the study looked at Researchers examined the diets of 65 infants. They assessed their body fat percentage from exams taken when they were 6, 9, 12 and 36 months old to determine whether the source of the baby food  homemade or commercially produced  influenced, in any way, their growth and weight. They found that by 9 months old, 22 percent of the infants had exclusively received homemade food and approximately the same percentage had received exclusively store-bought food. The majority of babies had received a combination of both homemade and store-bought. While there werent major differences in the infants lengths or weight at this age, researchers did find that the infants getting only homemade food were covering more of the seven different food groups than the babies only eating store-bought foods.        Get Info on an FDA Approved Treatment      At 12 months old, however, researchers began to see significant differences in the percentage of body fat in the infants; the percentage was higher in those consuming only store-bought foods. What the research found While the study was relatively small and involved limitations, including relying on parents to accurately recall and report how the babies were fed, the study did find that babies who ate a diet of only homemade foods were exposed to more diverse foods earlier in life and had lower body fat mass by the time they were 1 to 3 years old. What this means for parents Theres no way around it   making homemade baby food  is certainly more time-consuming and involves more planning than purchasing brand varieties at your local grocery store. But there are some benefits in addition to the potential health perks it provides to your child. You know exactly what youre feeding your baby.  There will be no need to put on your reading glasses to check the ingredients on the tiny labels. When youre the chef, you know what youre putting into your babys food. There are so many tools available to simplify the process.  From blenders to freezer trays and small glass containers, there are so many products on the market that help ease the cooking, planning and prepping process for parents. You might even save money.  Store-bought baby food can be pricey  especially when youre going the all-organic and all-natural route. Plus, when you cut out the container cost and prices involved in keeping it on store shelves, you might even save money by cooking it at home and reusing your own containers. Making your own baby food Ideally, you want to stock up on  loads of fresh fruits and veggies   frozen is fine as long as you read the ingredients closely to avoid brands with added sugar or salt. If you have a blender, its easy to toss in flavors your babys used to  for example, carrots or sweet potatoes (also naturally sweet so picky eaters are more likely to munch on them). But the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends holding off on gas-causing cruciferous veggies like broccoli and cauliflower until your little one is 10 to 12 months old.

Introducing Solid Foods to Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/introducing-solid-foods/,"Introducing solid foods is one of the most exciting (if messy) milestones of your baby's first year. Think of all the tastes and textures that await your little one  from savory cheese to juicy mango to creamy avocado. There's a whole world of flavors to discover and explore, and starting solids is the first step. Encourage your baby to enjoy herself while trying new foods, even if a good portion of them ends up on her bib, the tray or the floor. It's all part of the great experiment of taking those taste buds to the next level. WHEN CAN MY BABY START SOLIDS? Most babies are ready to start solids between 4 and 6 months, but your little one's individual development definitely tops the list when deciding whether or not it's time to graduate to a more varied diet. Though you might be eager to hop on the feeding bandwagon sooner rather than later, there are plenty of reasons why starting a baby on solids too soon isn't smart. First, a very early introduction to solids can occasionally trigger allergies. And a young baby's digestive system  from a tongue that pushes out any foreign substance placed on it, to intestines still lacking many digestive enzymes  is unready developmentally for solids. Plus, solids aren't necessary early on  babies can fill all their nutritional needs for the first 6 months of life from breast milk or formula alone. Bringing on the solids too soon can also undermine future eating habits (baby may reject those spoonfuls initially simply because she isn't ready, then may reject them later because of previous parental pushing). And especially in formula-fed babies, early introduction of solids can lead to obesity later on in childhood and beyond. On the other hand, waiting too long  say, until 8 or 9 months  can also lead to potential pitfalls. An older baby may resist being taught the new (and challenging) tricks of chewing and swallowing solids, preferring to cling to the tried-and-true (and easy) methods of breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. And, like habits, tastes can be harder to change at this point. Unlike the more pliable younger baby, an older baby may not be as open to solids when milky liquids have long monopolized the menu. SIGNS MY BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS To decide if your baby is ready for the big step into the world of solid foods at 4 months, not till 6 months, or somewhere in between, look for the following clues  and then consult your doctor: Your baby can  hold her head up  well when propped to sit. Even strained baby foods should not be offered until then. Chunkier foods should wait until a baby can  sit well alone , usually not until 7 months. The tongue thrust reflex has disappeared. Try this test: Place a tiny bit of baby-appropriate food thinned with breast milk or formula in your baby's mouth from the tip of a baby spoon or your finger. If the food comes right back out again with that tiny tongue, and continues to after several tries, the thrust is still present and baby isn't ready for spoon-feeding. Your baby reaches for and otherwise shows an interest in table foods. If she's grabbing the fork out of your hand or watching intently and excitedly with every bite you take, that may be a sign that she's hungry for more grown-up fare. Your baby is able to make back-and-forth and up-and-down movements with the tongue. How can you tell? Just watch carefully. Your little one is able to open wide, so that food can be taken from a spoon. WHAT ARE THE BEST FIRST FOODS TO FEED BABY? No matter what's on the menu, the texture of your  baby's first foods  should be super smooth and practically dripping off the spoon. If you prepare your own food, you should strain, puree or finely mash it, and then thin it with liquid if necessary. As your baby becomes a more experienced eater (usually around 7 months or older), gradually reduce the liquid you add and thicken the texture. Here are three foods to start with: Cereal.  If you start with baby cereal, pick a single-grain, iron-enriched, whole-grain variety, like brown rice, whole-grain oat or whole-grain barley. To prepare, mix a small amount of baby cereal with formula, breast milk or even water to create a creamy ""soup."" Don't sweeten the taste by adding things like mashed bananas, applesauce or juice  first, because it's best to introduce only one food at a time, and second, because it's better for baby to acquire a taste for plain before you sweeten the cereal pot. Vegetables.  Start with milder yellow or orange options such as sweet potatoes and carrots before moving on to the green team, like peas and string beans, which have slightly stronger flavors. If your baby rejects what you give her, try again tomorrow and the next day and the next. Some babies need to be introduced to a new food four or five (or more!) times before they'll accept it, so perseverance is key. Fruit.  Delicious, digestible first fruits include finely mashed bananas, baby applesauce, peaches and pears. For something completely different, and completely baby-friendly, start with smoothed-down mashed or pureed ripe avocado  it's creamy, yummy and loaded with healthy fats. Otherwise, you might want to adopt an approach that's often called "" baby-led weaning ,"" which bypasses pureed solids in favor of gummable solid foods presented in thick, long pieces, which younger babies can hold in their fists. (However, the  pincer grasp , which enables babies to make the leap to finger foods, doesn't usually develop until around month 8.) HOW CAN I HELP INTRODUCE SOLID FOODS TO MY BABY? One of the first and best steps in raising a good eater is to model healthy enjoyment of food yourself. Babies who see adults eating good food and enjoying it are more likely to be interested in following their example. A few more tips to help your baby discover solids: Time it right.   The ""perfect"" time of day to feed your baby is whatever time works for both of you. If you're  breastfeeding , you might try solids when your milk supply is at its lowest (probably late afternoon or early evening). Experiment: Offer a first course of formula or breast milk to whet that appetite, then bring on the solids. Start with one meal per day, then move up to two (probably a morning and evening meal) for the next month or so. Monitor baby's mood . As trying as those first feedings may be for you, they're even more of a challenge for your little one. So keep in mind that a baby who's cheerful and alert is more likely to open wide for an incoming spoon, and one who's cranky or getting sleepy may want only breast (or bottle). If your baby is fussy, be flexible  you might want to skip solids at that meal and try them next time. Don't rush . Food is never fast when it comes to babies  you'll be surprised at how long it takes to get one little spoonful into that little mouth (and ultimately down the hatch). Give yourself and your baby plenty of time for feedings  and get plenty of practice, too. You'll need it. Sit pretty.  Holding a squirming baby on your lap while trying to deposit an unfamiliar substance into an unreceptive mouth is a perfect recipe for disaster. Before your baby actually takes bite one, let her practice sitting in the high chair or feeding seat for a couple of days, adjusting the height of the tray or seat so it fits just right. And dont forget how wiggly your little worm can be  always fasten the safety straps, including the one around the crotch. If baby cant sit up at all in such a chair or seat, it's probably a good idea to postpone solids a little longer. Gear up.  Skip the silver spoon  a silicone, plastic or corn-based model with a small, soft bowl is much easier on tender gums. Count on having several on hand during feedings (one for you, one for baby and a spare when one lands on the floor) to foster baby's sense of independence and avoid power struggles (yes, those happen even at this age). And while youre gearing up, a word to the wise: Don't forget to put a bib on baby right from the start or youll face big-time resistance later. Make some introductions.  Before even attempting to bring spoon to mouth, put a dab of the food on the table or high chair tray and give baby a chance to examine it, squish it, mash it, rub it and maybe even taste it. That way, when you do approach with the spoon, what youre offering wont be totally unfamiliar. Ease in.  For someone whos brand new to the concept of spoon-feeding  and all the new textures that go with it  solids can come as a bit of a shock. So ease in. Start by gently placing about a quarter teaspoon of food on the tip of babys tongue. If thats swallowed, place the next quarter teaspoon a little farther back. At first, expect almost as much food to come in as goes out. Eventually your little one will get the hang of spoon-feeding  and respond mouth-open. Count on rejection.  Even bland tastes can be acquired tastes for a brand new solids eater. Babies may  reject a new food  several times or more before they decide to like it. So dont push when baby snubs what the spoon is delivering. But do try again another day. Invite imitation.  What your baby monkey sees, she may be more likely to do. It's an old parent trick but a goodie: Open up wide and take a pretend taste from the spoon  and don't forget to smack your lips and relish your make-believe bite enthusiastically. Know when enough is enough.  Knowing when it's time to stop feeding is as important as knowing when to start. A turned head or a clenched mouth are sure signs that baby is finished with this meal. Forcing a baby to eat is always a lost cause  and can actually set up future food fights. Need more help? These extra  tips introducing solid foods  to your baby should do the trick. WATCH FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONS While  food allergies  are pretty common in babies, kids usually outgrow them  though you do need to take them seriously. Babies' reactions to food can range from gassiness, diarrhea or mucus in the stool to vomiting and rashes  especially around the mouth or bottom. Other symptoms include a runny nose, watery eyes, wheezing that doesn't seem to be due to a cold and unusual wakefulness or crankiness, day or night. If you think your baby may be allergic to something you've fed her, wait about a week before trying the food again. If you get a similar reaction two or three times in a row, you can probably assume she's sensitive to it. Eliminate that food from her diet for several months, then try it again if your pediatrician gives the green light. If your baby seems to react to almost every new food you offer, or there's a history of allergies in your family, wait a full week between trying any new item, and do check in with your doctor. HOW DO I PREVENT CHOKING? Here's what to do to prevent choking when solid food is on the menu: Stay close. At this point, eating should be a spectator sport, with you closely watching every bite your baby takes. Start small.  Cut food into pieces tiny enough that your baby can swallow them whole if she doesn't spend any time gumming them (enthusiastic eaters often gulp them down). Get bigger slowly.  As your baby gets used to eating pieces of soft, solid food (and as you get more comfortable watching her eat them successfully), gradually move upfrom minced to chopped to small cubes. Keep the portions baby-sized.  Place only one or two chunks at a time on the plate or tray so she doesn't stuff in more than she can handle. Stay seated.  Not you, but baby. Offer finger foods to your baby only when she's sitting down  not crawling, cruising or toddling around. Eating on the run isn't just bad manners; it's unsafe for the inexperienced eater. Stay safe.  Don't give your baby foods that won't dissolve in the mouth, can't be mashed with the gums or can be easily sucked into the windpipe. Avoid uncooked raisins, whole peas (unless they are smashed), raw, firm-fleshed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) or fruit (apples, unripe pears, grapes), large chunks of meat or poultry, and common choking hazards including popcorn, nuts, chunky nut butters and hot dogs. WHAT NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN INTRODUCING SOLIDS Alarming as it might seem, if your baby gags during her first encounter with any kind of food, her reaction is normal. When a baby gags, its a sign that she has either taken in too much food or pushed it too far back in her mouth. In either case, the gag reflex is what helps her get that food all the way out of harm's way (and, usually, all the way back out onto the bib or tray in the process). Make sure your baby is sitting upright in her chair, offer manageable servings and be sure to learn the difference between gagging and  choking . A child who is choking will look terrified, will not be making any sounds and will be unable to breathe; a baby who is experiencing a gag reflex will be coughing and making sounds. Also, if most of what you serve your baby ends up on the floor or otherwise uneaten, it's not a cause for concern, aside from any completely legit worries you might have about wasting food (and you can help conserve food and prevent waste by keeping serving sizes small). Your baby's first experiments with food are more about the ""experiment"" and less about the food  more about gaining experience than gaining sustenance, in other words. The bulk of your child's nutritional needs for the first year are still going to be met by breast milk or formula. Also, although it was once common to delay giving a baby certain foods like dairy, eggs, seafood and nuts in the hopes of staving off allergies,  the AAP no longer recommends doing so  since the data shows that holding off on certain foods does not prevent food allergies. In fact, in 2015, the AAP said that introducing allergenic foods like peanut butter earlier in a child's lifein the4- to 11-month rangeactually reduces her chances of developing a food allergy .Just be sure you've successfully introduced a couple of other solids (cereals, fruits or vegetables) first, and be sure to introduce the foods one at a time at home (not, say, at baby's day care center). Not so sure what's best for your baby? Check with her pediatrician. WHAT WILL MY BABY BE READY FOR NEXT? Those early-bird specials (rice cereal, applesauce, bananas, yellow veggies) get pretty old after a few dozen meals. Spice things up (at around 7 or 8 months) by adding minced meat (chicken, lamb, turkey or beef), mashed eggs and avocado to her repertoire. By 8 months (and possibly even sooner), whole-milk yogurt, cheese, pasta, beans and tofu can make their debuts, and then  finger foods  add a whole other dimension to eating. Ready to serve up a combo platter? That's fine, as long as you keep the foods separate for a while. Your goal is to get your baby acquainted (and happy) with the taste of particular foods, so if you mush the meats and veggies together, she may never know the joy of just plain peas. Once she likes the taste of a variety of different flavors, feel free to mix things up. Always hold off on honey (which can contain spores of  Clostridium botulinum,  a bacteria that is harmless to adults but can cause botulism, a serious illness, in babies) and cow's milk until your baby is at least 1 year old. Most doctors will, however, green-light whole-milk yogurt, cottage cheese and hard cheese by 8 months or so, or even sooner. If all this sounds complicated, take heart: In some ways, feeding a baby is easier than satisfying sophisticated older palates. Baby's first solid foods can be served cold, slightly warmed or at room temperature. And don't worry about adding salt, sugar or other spices  even the mildest pureed squash is an adventurous new taste and sensation for a little one just starting out."

Food Messiness,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/behavior/food-messiness.aspx,"What it is Oops, time for another load of laundry! Just as much food ends up on your toddler's face, hands, clothes, high chair, and floor as it does in his mouth. Some tuneful tots also get into the habit of making razzing sounds while blowing out food from their mouths  creating a mess in the process. Why it happens Children who are learning how to feed themselves brandish their spoon with delight (""There goes another pea!""). But that doesn't mean they're intentionally setting out to create a mess. Eating is a learning experience (""What will happen if I squish this with my fingers?"") and a time to fine-tune those fine-motor self-feeding skills. What you need to know Have patience. Let him practice the art of self-feeding (messes included) and your toddler will gradually become more skilled at feeding himself. In fact, most children will master this skill by the time they're 20 months old. If yours hasn't yet, bring it up with the pediatrician at your next visit. What to do about it In addition to the following tips, check out the strategies for handling  Food Throwing . Serve foods that are more likely to stick to the spoon, such as chunky applesauce, mashed potatoes, and oatmeal. If your child is a ""food blower,"" make sure he gets no reaction from you. That means no admonishment or sign of amusement. You might also switch to foods that aren't as suitable for creating sound effects, such as slivers of banana, pieces of cheese, teething biscuits, and soft, whole-grain bread. How to prevent it Give your child plenty of opportunity to play with finger paint, bubbles, sand, play clay, and other interesting material. Providing fun, tactile, nonfood experiences may help reduce your toddler's culinary curiosity at the table."

These Whole Foods Ready Meals Could Cause Miscarriage in Pregnant Women,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0615/ready-to-eat-whole-foods-items-could-be-deadly-for-pregnant-women,"Over the course of several inspections in February of a Whole Foods' kitchen in Massachusetts, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) staff found multiple violations, including the presence of listeria on a food prep surface. The bacteria is especially dangerous to pregnant women. FDA reps sent a letter to Whole Foods  last week describing the listeria contamination. After swabbing 100 surfaces throughout the facility, inspectors found a swab from the vegetable chopping machine tested positive for listeria. According to the FDA, this indicated that other surfaces were at risk of growing listeria, as well.

The letter also outlined several other concerning violations, including: Ceiling condensation dripping on to preparation surfaces and food storage spaces Dirty dishes piling up near food High pressure hoses used for cleaning spraying into food prep areas Too much acid in solutions used to soak and treat vegetables Employees not washing their hands between tasks Inadequate hot water at some sinks Sanitizer to clean surfaces accidentally sprayed onto foods Employee clothing touching foods These violations affectedat leastthe following ready meals: Pesto pasta Mushroom quesadillas Egg salad Anything with chives and beets Couscous Quinoa cakes Anything with leafy salad greens Chicken, turkey and other meats Enchiladas Salad dressings Whole Foods reps say they've addressed all of the problems listed in the letter and they don't know why the FDA didn't acknowledge these changes when they sent the letter months later. FDA reps say Whole Foods' response efforts up to this point have been inadequate, in part because Whole Foods management has not yet shared a plan for forcing this facility to comply with FDA regulations in the future. Last year, Whole Foods recalled deli pasta and curry chicken made at the same kitchen due to listeria contamination. Listeria is especially harmful to pregnant women, who are 13 times more likely to develop listeriosis if they come in contact with it though in general the risk is still very low. Unlike most other bacteria, listeria enters the bloodstream directly, and it can pass through the placenta, potentially causing miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and meningitis in newborns. Common listeriosis symptoms includefever over 100.6F, muscle pain, backache, headache and diarrhea.

Some 'First Finger Foods' May Pose Choking Hazard,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0504/some-first-finger-foods-pose-choking-hazard-study-finds,"When you're introducing baby to  finger foods , usually around 7 or 8 months, you'll be excited to chop baby's food into a manageable size at first. But after a some time, you might find yourself relying on prepackaged ""first finger foods."" And while many are healthy options for baby, some on the other hand can pose a choking hazard, a new study finds. The study, whose research is still ongoing, was presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting this past weekend and looked at five different types of ""first finger foods"" on grocery store shelves: melts, cooked produce, puff grain snacks, biscuits and cereals. Researchers found only two of the products met all three criteria for  first finger foods recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics . These criteria are: soft, easy to swallow and in small pieces. The products in the study were: Fruit & Veggie and Yogurt Melts, Fruit and Veggie Pick-Ups, Lil' Crunchies, Wagon Wheels, Arrowroot Cookies and Puffs all by Gerber and Cheerios. Researchers had 41 adults attempt to dissolve each product without using their teeth at two different times, once after the product was just removed from packaging and again after it had been left out for at least an hour. They recorded the number of seconds it took for products first to break up and become soft and second to dissolve and become small enough to swallow.             Psoriasis Treatment    Get Info on a Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Treatment.   www.informationaboutpsoriasis.com         Of the foods just removed from packaging, the cooked produce (Gerber Fruit and Veggie Pick-Ups) were the only food that became soft almost immediately, making them the only product that fit all three of AAP's criteria. But the yogurt melts, Puffs, Cheerios and Wagon Wheels all become soft within 9 seconds or less, which researchers say isn't a significant safety risk. The foods that had been left out (to simulate how long it takes a baby to eat) did not vary significantly in how long it took them to become soft or dissolve except for the melts, which took more than 1 minute to dissolve in some instances. When left out, the melts become almost like hard candy, some participants said.They also reported that Arrowroot Cookies were too big for one bite and that Wagon Wheels could scratch up the inside of a baby's mouth. Researchers have taken their concerns about the safety of these three products to Gerber. Whether you rely on prepackaged finger foods or not, you should know how to safely introduce finger foods. Only give finger foods once baby can sit up without support and can bring her hands or other objects to her mouth. Some foods will say they're safe once baby is  crawling , but this is not an accurate indicator that baby is ready to self-feed. Look for foods  that can be gummed before swallowing or will dissolve easily in the mouth, like crackers, bread, toast or rice cakes. Try foods that baby liked in pureed form by cutting them up into cubes or chunks pea-sized for firmer foods and marble-sized for softer foods. Start with four or five pieces on baby's feeding tray and add more once baby eats them. Only feed finger foods to a seated and strapped-in baby, not one who is crawling, cruising or toddling around. Coat slippery pieces of fruits and veggies in a pulverized cereal dust to make it easier to grip. Avoid any foods that won't dissovle, can't be smashed with gums or can be easily sucked into the windpipe. Examples include uncooked raisins, whole peas, raw and firm vegetables and fruit (carrots, bell peppers, apples, unripe pears, grapes) and chunks of meat. 3 Things to Read Next: Know the Difference Between 'Natural' and 'Organic' What You Need to Know About Arsenic in Baby's Rice Cereal More Kids Are Poisoned By Detergent Packets"

Baby-Led Weaning,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/baby-led-weaning/,"Thinking about  starting your sweetie on solids ? You may imagine mounds of mushy rice cereal and pureed peas plus lots of time coaxing baby to open that tiny mouth. But it doesnt have to be that way. A growing number of moms are bypassing purees and jarred baby food altogether with baby-led weaning  giving their babies control over what (and how much) they put in their mouths. More in this article: What is baby-led weaning? When to start Benefits Downsides Risk of choking Safety tips Getting started Best foods for baby-led weaning What is baby-led weaning? Popular in the U.K. and gaining traction in the U.S., baby-led weaning is a practice where babies 6 months old or older jump straight to  finger foods  as soon as solids are introduced, bypassing purees and mashed-up foods. It's called baby-led because that's what the premise is  letting your little one feed herself the healthy foods she wants to eat right from the start (which is why this works only for a baby who's at least 6 months old and capable of self-feeding). And it allows babies to learn how to chew (or more accurately, gum) first, then swallow. It also prevents parents from pushing food, since babies are in control of how much they put into their mouths. When to start baby-led weaning Experts including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) now recommend the best time to start baby-led weaning (and all solids, for that matter), is at 6 months. By that age, most  babies are able to sit up by themselves  and  grab  and hold onto objects. They've also dropped the tongue-thrust reflex (which causes them to push foreign substances out of their mouths), plus their intestines have developed the necessary digestive enzymes to absorbsolid food. Wondering if baby-led weaning is right for your child? Run the idea by your little ones pediatrician for an opinion; while most babies will get the green light, some (those who have special needs and are unable to pick up and chew foods on their own) might not be able to try baby-led weaning. Then look to your baby  some like taking the lead, while others dont. Benefits of baby-led weaning According to advocates and some research, babies who start solids with baby-led weaning are: Familiar with more different textures and flavors than babies who are fed purees, which may make them more likely to develop more varied and healthy food preferences in the long run.Plus a number of studies have shown that babies who eat a variety of foods (including peanut products and fish ) may actually be less likely to have food allergies later in life. Less likely to become overweight than children who are spoon-fed. With spoon-feeding, the parent is in control (which may make babies eat faster and more than they really need, potentially leading to a habit of ignoring feelings of fullness)  but similar to breastfeeding, baby-led weaning allows baby to self-regulate how much she eats based on her hunger levels. Developing manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination skills. Learning how to chew, which aids in digestion. Downsides of baby-led weaning Though there are plenty of reasons to consider baby-led weaning, there are a couple of downsides, including: Its messy:  Eating finger foods is messy for babies of any age, especially those who are learning how to hang onto it and get it into their mouths. You need to pay attention to iron:  Breastfed babies get enough iron from your breast milk until baby is 4 months old  but levels can diminish at this point, which is why your pediatrician will likely add an iron supplement to the mix (1 mg/kg per day) until baby starts eating iron-rich solids. However it can be hard for some babies to chew on many iron-rich foods (like beef). Pureed meat, green veggies and fortified cereals can help fill the gap. Your doctor may also recommend that your little one stay on an iron supplement through the first year as an added precaution. Is my baby at risk of choking? Concerned about choking ? Not to worry, as long as  you offer safe foods   your little ones gums are quite capable of chewing soft foods. Worried your new eater will turn into a new gagger? It happens  especially in the first few weeks of baby-led weaning  as baby tries to maneuver unfamiliar lumps in her mouth. But it's important to remember that gagging is actually a safety response to food traveling too far back into the mouth  and it's not choking, which is silent. When babies gag, they're actually handling the problem themselves, and it's best to just stay calm (or at least look calm) and wait until it passes. The gagging will ease up as baby learns to cope with the solids and the lumps. Still, its important to learn the difference between gagging and choking, and what to do if its the latter: A child who is gagging  appears to be coughing mildly and may make a little noise. A child who is choking  will look terrified, be unable to breathe and make no noise. Safety tips As long as you present food safely, baby-led weaning is safe for baby. A few tips to ensure your baby stays safe when you start: Avoid serving any  foods that are choking hazards , including nuts, whole grapes, apples with the skin and cherries. Never leave a baby alone with food. Keep baby sitting upright in her high chair while eating. Watch for  allergic reactions . That said, the thinking is no longer to hold back on certain foods to avoid allergies: The more options you offer, the more likely your newbie foodie will accept different foods, which translates into fewer mealtime battles in the future. Explain baby-led weaning to everyone who takes care of your child so that they follow the same safety precautions you do. Getting started on baby-led weaning You may be skeptical that your 6-month-old will be able to handle whole pieces of food right off the bat, but your babys ability to chow down will likely amaze you. If you've decided to start your baby on solidsthe baby-led-weaning way, follow these basic principles: Invest in a big bib.  Consider dressing your little one in just a diaper and covering her with an oversize bib or smock, and put a drop cloth or newspaper on the floor beneath the high chair. Continuing to nurse or bottle-feed . Keep up the same  nursing frequency  or  bottle-feeding frequency , since babies get the majority of their nutrition from breast milk or formula throughout most of the first year. Skip the schedule.  You may have heard that you should put your baby on a feeding schedule that incorporates breast milk or formula plus three meals of solid food a day. But if you choose baby-led weaning, simply offer solids at mealtime, and let your baby decide if shes up for eating them. Cut food into thick sticks or strips.  Slice foods up so baby can hold them in her fist and chew from the top down (instead of tiny bite-sized pieces). Start slowly.  At the beginning, you only need to place one or two pieces of food in front of your little one at mealtimes. More and you may overwhelm baby with too many choices. Dont worry about plates or bowls for now.  Shell toss em on the floor anyway. Just place the food right on the table or high-chair tray, and let the party start. Dine together.  Theres no reason if your dinner is steamed cauliflower and salmon that baby cant eat the same foods right along with you. Eating is a social activity, so let your little one see what you do with food and give her a chance to mimic you. Baby wants your toast or reaches for the banana youre snacking on? Offer her a portion (as long as its baby-appropriate). Encourage fun.  Think of solid food meals as playtime, when baby explores different textures and experiments with tasting and chewing. Baby-led weaning is all about getting comfortable with various foods. Offer a variety of foods.  Over time, expose your baby to a wide range of choices to help her develop an adventurous palate and make her less likely to be a picky eater later in life. Serve up foods of different colors (roasted tomatoes, steamed green beans and sweet potatoes) and different textures (smooth avocados, crisp watermelon, grainy whole-wheat bread and even tender cooked pasta). Dont force the issue.  Since your baby is getting the nutrition she needs form formula or breast milk, dont be surprised if she eats very little in the first few months. Let her set the pace. As she gets more proficient and starts to eat more, shell gradually consume less breast milk or formula in favor of the solid foods shes learning to love. Best foods for baby-led weaning As long as its soft and/or crumbly, cut into small, manageable pieces (baby fist-size) and not on the list of foods that pose a choking risk, its on the baby-led weaning menu. Dont worry about how much or how little your baby eats in the first few months; just do your best to serve up a well-rounded diet. Consider offering a food from each of these food groups every day to ensure  babys getting the nutrients she needs : Grains , such as whole-wheat fusilli pasta or wheat toast with hummus Healthy fats , such as avocados (eaten on their own or smeared on bread) Protein , such as boiled chicken or beef, eggs or  grilled fish  (be careful to remove any bones) Fruits and vegetables , such as a piece of banana or avocado; a ripe triangle of pear; steamed broccoli, carrots or green beans; or sweet-potato fries (all of these are easily mashed by toothless gums and are either shaped like thick sticks or can easily be cut into thick strips, which are easy for baby to hold) Dairy , such as yogurt and soft pasteurized cheeses like ricotta or cottage cheese (if given the chance, babies can learn to spoon-feed themselves) Theres no need to add salt, sugar or artificial sweeteners to your babys foods, since they dont add any nutritional value. Whats more, they mask the innate flavors of babys foods  and some research has even found that  babies dont actually have any preference at all for these tastes . Plus, consistent use of salt or sugar sets kids up to prefer salty or sugary foods in the long run. (Its fine, however, to season food with herbs and spices  your baby might love the kick in flavor.) Skip chips, cookies and other prepackaged, prepared foods, too, since they tend to be devoid of nutrients and full of additives and unhealthy trans-fats. Keep in mind, too, that baby-led weaning, like so many other parenting philosophies, isnt an all-or-nothing proposition. You can choose baby-led weaning some of the time, alternating with spoon-feeding or adding to it (baby eats a chunk of banana, you spoon in some yogurt).

Toddler Not Eating,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/ask-heidi/toddler-not-eating.aspx,"Toddlers are notoriously  picky eaters , and you can look forward to your daughter or son going through all kinds of phases when it comes to food (let's see, there's the ""only beige food"" phase, the ""no foods that touch each other"" phase, the ""one food only"" phase, just to name a few). As for the ""one meal a day"" phase you're experiencing, it's pretty normal and usually nothing to worry about. That's because most parents don't realize how little toddlers actually need to eat (those tiny tummies fill up fast) and also that toddlers actually eat more than their parents think (a handful of Cheerios here and a few cubes of cantaloupe there add up!). The bottom line: If your child is thriving, she's probably getting what she needs. How should you handle your child's  food strikes  in the meantime? Offer food, but don't push it (parental pushing may lead to future eating problems), and try not to send the signal that her not eating is stressing you out (even if it is!). Make sure you're offering her healthy food choices, so that when she does decide to nibble she's getting the nutrients she needs. Also, be sure there aren't other things sabotaging her appetite. Too many calories from liquids, for example, be it milk or juice, can definitely keep a toddler's tender appetite satisfied, leaving less room for solids. Finally, find out if she's  teething : Molars, which usually make a painful entrance between the ages of 13 and 19 months, can also stand in the way of a toddler and her interest in food.

Most Pregnant Women Aren't Eating the Recommended Amount of Fish,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/most-pregnant-women-arent-eating-recommended-amount-fish/,"Confused about  what types of fish you shouldand shouldnteat ? Youre not alone. On the one hand, pregnant women are encouraged to eat fish in order to reap its big health benefits for both mom and baby, including loads of cell-building protein and brain-boosting omega 3 fatty acids. On the other hand, you may be worried about mercury, which, when eaten in excess during pregnancy, can be dangerous for developing babies. Good news: Today, two of the countrys leading health and safety groups, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are setting the record straight about  how much fish pregnant women should eat . A new set of guidelines aim to make it easier for you to make dietary decisionsguilt-free. What the guidelines say The new fish consumption guidelines are aimed at women who are planning to conceive, pregnant, breastfeeding or have young children. While the recommendations have remained mostly the same since the FDA and EPA released their last joint recommendations back in 2014, the agencies have added three types of fish to avoid (orange roughy, bigeye tuna and marlin) and created  an easy-to-read chart  that sorts 62 types of fish into three categories: Best choices: Eat two to three servings a week Good choices: Eat about one serving per week Fish to avoid Nearly 90 percent of all fish eaten in the U.S. fall into the low-mercury best choices category. That means the fish youre most likely already eatingincluding shrimp, pollock, salmon, canned light tuna, tilapia, catfish and codall make the cut. Fish to avoid include seven types of fish that are higher in mercury: tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, marlin and king mackerel. Wondering whether its safe for pregnant women and nursing moms to eat fish caught recreationally? (Spring fishing season is around the corner) The new guidelines suggest erring on the side of caution: Check local state advisories for the waters where the fish was caught; if no information is available, stick to just one serving of these fish per week, with skin and excess fat removed. What expecting women and moms need to know An estimated one in two expecting women still eats less than 2 ounces of fish per weekfar less than the current recommendations, which date back to June 2014 when the EPA and FDA released a joint statement encouraging moms to eat more fish. The latest guidelines (which reaffirm previous recommendations) suggest that expecting women eat  two to three servings, or 8 to 12 ounces , of lower-mercury fish every week. They also recommend that children 2 years old and up should eat one to two servings of lower-mercury fish every week. Fish are an important source of protein and other nutrients for young children and women who are or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding. This advice clearly shows the great diversity of fish in the U.S. market that they can consume safely, said FDA Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine Stephen Ostroff, M.D., in a statement. This new, clear and concrete advice is an excellent tool for making safe and healthy choices when buying fish. What this means for you Fish is an often-overlooked but essential component of  any healthy pregnancy diet . So make it a goal to eat two to three 4-oz. servings of good choices low-mercury fish per week. Complement that with plenty of fresh, whole foodsincluding fruits, veggies, lean meats, legumes, dairy and nutsand youll be setting yourself up to make one healthy, well-nourished babyand a healthier mom-to-be, too."
Eating Vegetarian and Vegan During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-vegetarian-vegan-during-pregnancy/,"Got a beef with beef (or chicken, fish, eggs ordairy)? There is no reason to worry. You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet even now that youre expecting. Here is what you should know to make sure you and your baby are still getting everything you need. Can I still follow a vegetarian or vegan diet when I'm pregnant? Don't be surprised if you come across well-meaningnaysayers; there are still so many misconceptions about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy. In truth, vegetarians and vegans have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies. Why is there any concern at all? Some of the most vital baby-boosting nutrients are more easily found in meats and other animal-based products. In good news, it's still a cinch to getthem elsewhere. What nutrients will I need to be extra careful to get when I'm pregnant and vegan or vegetarian? Protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D are all nutrients to be mindful of when you're expecting and adhering to your vegetarian or vegan diet. ADVERTISING PROTEIN Why:   Expecting women need more protein than ever  that's because this essential nutrient helps build cells and make hormones for your growing baby. If youre a dairy- and egg-eating vegetarian, you may already get what you need from potent protein sources (craving moreomelets and Greek yogurt now that you're pregnant?). If you're worried you're not getting enough or are a vegan, there are veggie-based proteins that you can add into your diet.  How Much:  75 grams per day Foods to Eat:  Legumes, whole grains, soy and nuts and seeds Split or green peas Chickpeas Black, navy, kidney or pinto beans Quinoa Bulgar, buckwheat and whole wheat couscous Oatmeal Whole-wheat pasta Whole-grain cereals and breads Nut butters Walnuts, cashews, pistachios, almonds, Brazil nuts and pine nuts Soy milk Tofu Miso CALCIUM Why:  Calcium is key for building your babys bones, muscles, heart and nerves, especially during the third trimester. In fact, it's so essential to his development that what he doesn't get from what you eat, he'll take from your bones, potentially putting you at risk of osteoporosis later in life. Luckily, dairy products aren't the only options for getting your daily recommended amounts. Your practitioner may also suggest that you add a calcium supplement for extra insurance. How Much: 1,000 mg per day Foods to Eat : Yogurt Milk Cheese Green leafy vegetables Soy milk Tofu Calcium-fortified orange juice IRON Why:  Your blood volume increases by nearly 50 percent during pregnancy to support you and your developing baby  and iron is required to produce more red blood cells. Not getting enough? Low iron  can result in anemia , which, left untreated, may also lead to preterm labor  and low birth weight. Vegetarians and vegans aren't alone in needing to be conscious of iron levels during pregnancy. Even red-meat eaters have a hard time getting enough from their diets while expecting. One simple way to get what you need is to take an iron supplement, which your practitioner may recommend in addition to your prenatal vitamin after week 20 (or earlier, if routine testing shows your iron stores are low). Its a good idea to also chow down on iron-rich foods. How Much:  About 27 mg Foods to Eat: Beans Edamame Soy products Oat bran Barley Quinoa Bulgur Pumpkin seeds Dried fruit Spinach, collard greens or kale Seaweed VITAMIN B12  Why:  Vitamin B12 partners with folic acid to help with proper fetal brain development; its also important for the formation of red blood cells and for building genetic material. A deficiency has been  linked to neural tube defects  as well as  increased risk of preterm labor . Though B12 deficiencies are rare, vegetarians and particularly vegans often dont get enough of this vitamin, since its found only in foods that come from animals. Ask your practitioner if you need more than what's provided in your prenatal vitamin; she can recommend a supplemental B12  as well as folic acid  and ensure you're not getting too much of a good thing. How Much:  2.6 mcgper day Foods to Eat:  Vitamin B12-fortified soy milk Fortified cereals Nutritional yeast Fortified meat substitutes VITAMIN D Why:  This vital vitamin plays a role in building and maintaining healthy teeth and bones. Severe deficiency  has been linked to  complications including congenital rickets (a condition that causes the bones to become soft and weak, leading to poor growth and skeletal deformities) as well as bone fractures in newborns. The best dietary sources of vitamin D are milk and fish. If neither are part of your diet, a few minutes of sun each day helps your body produce vitamin D  though that can be tough, especially if you have darker skin, live in less-sunny climates, dont get outdoors a lot or wear sunscreen. You can get some vitamin D from fortified soy milk, breads, cereals and OJ, but usually not nearly enough. Fortunately, you can get what you need from a supplement. So ask your practitioner about testing your vitamin D levels and prescribing a supplement as needed. RELATED:  11 Best Foods to Eat While Pregnant How will a vegetarian or vegan diet effect my baby, and how will I know theres a problem? Theres every reason you can have a healthy pregnancy and baby, as long as you: Eat  a well-balanced pregnancy diet , focusing on the above nutrients Take your prenatal vitamin  every day Visit your doctor for all of your regular prenatal appointments, and dont hesitate to share any symptoms that concern you. Your doctor will monitor you for any potential issues and ensure youre not deficient in the nutrients you need What if I crave meat while Im pregnant? Given all those changes in hormones, lots of expecting moms find that their tastes in foods change somewhat or even a lot in pregnancy. And  most pregnant women have food cravings , often for meat. If you feel okay about making an exception for meat during pregnancy, thats perfectly fine; you can get back to being vegetarian or vegan if you want after babys arrival. You may also want to consider just adding fish, eggs and dairy to your diet, if you dont eat them already; again, its not necessary. Otherwise, focus on eating your favorite protein-packed meat substitutes, which may help calm cravings. Can I stay vegetarian or vegan while Im breastfeeding? You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet if youre breastfeeding. However if your diet might be lacking some important vitamins and minerals (B12, zinc or calcium, if youre vegetarian or vegan)  and especially if your baby has health problems or was born prematurely  your doctor might recommend additional supplements for your baby.

Eating Fish During Pregnancy: What's Safe and What Isn't,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-fish-during-pregnancy/,"If youre unsure of the rules on fish and pregnancy, youre not alone: Theres been plenty of conflicting views over the years. Fish is heart healthy! But wait, it's also full of mercury. Fish is loaded with baby-friendly DHA! But not so fast  it's also loaded with PCBs. So whats the real dish on fish? The bottom line is that eating enough of the right types is not only healthy but recommended for both you and your baby. Heres the lowdown on whats safe and whats not when it comes to seafood. How Much Fish You Should Eat So how much seafood should you eat during pregnancy? In 2014 and again 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  released joint statements encouraging moms to eat more pregnancy-safe fish.  The groups said that expecting and breastfeeding women should eat  8 to 12 ounces  (that's two to three servings) of low-mercury fish every week. Fish to Avoid During Pregnancy Though the benefits of fish are many, you should still avoid a few types during pregnancy. Some  particularly large, ocean-faring, predator-types   contain high levels of mercury , a distinctly baby-unfriendly toxin. Others  especially those that live in polluted lakes and rivers  can be laden with PCBs, a chemical you definitely don't want to feed a fetus or an infant. ADVERTISING To play it safe, the latest FDA and EPA recommendations suggest avoiding or limiting the following fish while you're pregnant and nursing: Avoid It's best to avoid these seven types of fish, which are all higher in mercury: tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, marlin and king mackerel. Limit to one serving per week The following fish are considered ""good to eat,"" which means you can safely eat one serving per week (that's approximately 4 ounces): Bluefish, buffalofish, carp, Chilean sea bass, grouper, halibut, mahi mahi, monkfish, rockfish, sablefish, sheepshead, snapper, spanish mackerel, striped bass (ocean), Tilefish from the Atlantic ocean, albacore white tuna (canned, fresh or frozen), yellowfin tuna, weakfish/seatrout and white croaker/Pacific croaker.  See the full list here. Exercise extra caution if you're planning to eat recreationally-caught fish: Check local state  advisories  for the waters where the fish was caught. If no information is available, stick to one serving of these fish per week, with skin and excess fat removed. Safe Fish During Pregnancy Despite the long list of fish to limit during pregnancy, the vast majority of fish you'll find in the store and at restaurants are considered safe to eat when you're expecting at two to three servings (that's 8 to 12 ounces) per week. These include wild salmon, shrimp, catfish, tilapia, sole, flounder, haddock, halibut, ocean perch, pollock, cod, canned light tuna, crab, crawfish, lobster, hake, clams, black sea bass, anchovies and trout. Heard conflicting advice on salmon, too? Salmon's definitely one of nature's best providers of DHA. But to ensure you're not also feasting on the high levels of PCBs often found in farmed salmon, opt for wild (which also contains more of those healthy omega-3 fats) or organic farmed salmon. How to Properly Prepare Fish By now youve probably heard that  you should avoid sushi during pregnancy   and the same goes for any other raw (oysters, ceviche, smoked salmon) or undercooked fish, since they can contain bacteria and parasites (like Listeria) that are dangerous for your developing baby. Here are a few tips to properly prepare fish and help reduce your exposure to any potential contaminants: Buy only fresh, properly refrigerated seafood. Store it in the fridge in a sealed container if youre not cooking it immediately. Use separate cutting boards for meats (including fish) and fruits/veggies. Dont reuse marinades. Cook seafood (all types, including shucked clams, oysters, shrimp, lobsterand scallops) until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 F; if a thermometer isnt available, youll know its done when the flesh is opaque (milky white); fish fillets should flake easily with a fork. Clams, mussels and oysters are cooked when their shells open; throw away any that dont. The Benefits of Fish The good news (at least for moms who enjoy seafood) is that  fish really does offer big benefits  for both pregnant women and their developing babies. Fish: Supports fetal growth.  Fish is a first-rate source of lean protein, an essential amino acid that  helps create all of babys cells   from skin and muscle to hair and bones. Is good for babys brain.  What's more, fish (especially the fattier varieties, like salmon) is a source of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which has been shown to boost baby brain power. Its more important than ever in the third trimester, when your  babys brain growth  is fast and furious. Boosts your memory.  Speaking of boosted brain power, getting enough  omega-3s may also improve your memory   especially helpful when youre battling a case of  pregnancy brain . Improves your   mood : An adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids and especially  DHA has been shown  to decrease your risk of  depression during pregnancy  as well as  postpartum depression . Supports your heart:  A diet rich in fish  may lower your risk of cardiac disease  by reducing blood clotting and levels of triglycerides (blood fat) as well as lowering blood pressure if you have preexisting hypertension. May reduce risk of preterm birth.  Scientists have observed that rates of  preterm birth  are lower in areas with a high fish intake  and some studies have indeed linked adequate omega 3 intake (whether through fish or supplements) to a lower risk of preterm birth.

"Women Might Be Able to Eat During Labor After All, Admits New Study",http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/women-might-be-able-eat-during-labor-new-study-finds/,"What if I asked you to run a marathon, with just one catch: You couldn't eat anything before or during your race  in the off-chance you might suddenly need emergency surgery while approaching the finish line? Im guessing you would completely scoff at me. Yet thats exactly what hospitals ask women during labor and childbirth to do. Thankfully, a new  study  is adding to the growing evidence in support of letting laboring women eat.     Melanoma Therapy   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       What the Study Found The study, released by  Obstetrics & Gynecology,  looked at a total of 3,982 laboring women and analyzed how letting them freely eat affected labor outcomes, the babys health and C-section rates. Overall, it found that eating during delivery had absolutely zero negative repercussions. It didnt even (gasp) make women vomit, like many an old-school doctor told me would happen during my time as an OB nurse. Historically, women have always eaten during birth, because, well, its kind of common sense that when theyre going through one of the most physically and emotionally challenging experiences of their lives, they might need a little nourishment. There were even special traditions and customs that women in different cultures had surrounding food during labor  for example, some would bake a groaning cake to distract them through their contractions while others drank special brews to keep them calm. (Spoiler alert: They usually contained alcohol!) After the 1940s, however, doctors began restricting women from eating during labor. Their reason? They feared that should women need an emergency C-section, any food in their stomachs could wind up in their lungs, which wasusually fatal. That risk has changed today for two main reasons: 1) most C-sections, even emergency ones, do not use general anesthesia, which is when that complication can occur 2) the actual number of emergency C-sections using general anesthesia is very low anyway, because it poses major risks to both Mom and baby. Even without the fear of a C-section, certain doctors have other reasons for discouraging eating during labor. Some view it as pointless, since women are getting hydrated through an IV and because during transition, when women fully dilate, they may get sick and vomit, a completely natural occurrence. But with the length of labor being so different for every woman  like, absurdly different  is it pointless to fuel up, especially for those enduring particularly drawn-out deliveries? One  study  found an average length of labor to be over 13 hours, and lets keep in mind that most of that is latent, early labor, when a woman isnt yet experiencing full-blown contractions. In other words, nearly a whole day can pass for a mom-to-be with nary a bagel or a banana to be had. Although the tide has been turning toward allowing women to eat during labor, former methods die hard, especially in hospital settings. What This Means for You This latest study is an encouraging step in the right direction. Soon it may become more common practice to encourage women to at least snack during labor, especially if lack of nourishment isnt helping them maintain the strength they need for delivery or if their labor is protracted. If youre a woman who cant imagine giving birth on an empty stomach, its worthwhile to speak to your medical practitioner or midwife about whether you can bring some treats with you to the delivery room or if you can be served a meal at the hospital. Your doctor may even be able to recommend foods that are packed full of energy and will sit well in your stomach through all the contractions  and as you reach the finish line to meet the ultimate prize, your newborn baby."

The Rude Things People Say When They Find Out We Don't Eat Meat,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/family/vegetarian-moms-and-the-rude-things-people-say,"Im an open-book mom. If you want to talk about postpartum depression, Ill willingly discuss the drugs I took and the terrifying thoughts that gripped my psyche. Ive been known to overshare about my sex life, my bulimic college days and the alcoholism in my family tree. You want to ""go there"" with me, Im game. The thing I do not want to discuss openly is what my family eats. Of all the ""controversial"" things Ive talked about on the soccer field and in the school lobby, the one thats garnered the most offensive and uninformed comments is my familys decision to  follow a vegetarian diet . SEE ALSO:  Raising Your Child Vegetarian             Psoriasis Treatment Info    Get Info on a Treatment for Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis   www.informationaboutpsoriasis.com         Oooo eeee! The judgments that hit me the second I mention I'm a vegetarian mom! If you want to see other peoples heads fly off their shoulders, tell them you've decided to forego animal meat for the foreseeable future. Seriously, stand back. Funny, the biggest gasps came from single men who couldn't believe that I was depriving my children of the joys of bacon. And steak. But mostly bacon. An unmarried guy in my office said it perfectly: ""Depriving children of their birthright is just wrong. Its child abuse."" He laughed, but he wasnt really kidding. The majority of those who learned about my familys vegetarian diet fell into two camps, both of whom made comments that gave me heartburn. The first assumed that I was a rigid, humorless food Nazi who judged them for eating meat. No matter how many times I tried to tell them that I wasnt critical of their pork chops or chicken fingers, they were constantly apologizing around me. I honestly wasnt judging anyones food. Our decision to try a meatless diet stemmed from my husbands conversations with his father, who had recently read  The China Study  and done some research. I personally never read a thing about it. I dont know that much about heart health, cholesterol or agribusiness farms. Im ashamed to say it, but Im not much of an animal lover either. But I am open to new ideas. And also? My husband is the cook. So, alas, I turned vegetarian. Still, there was no convincing a huge segment of people that I wasnt mentally sending them all to hell for enjoying their turkey sandwiches. The second and more challenging group were those who were incredulous. What in the world do you feed your children? they'd ask. My answer was never sexy or complicated enough. No one wants to hear about our beans, nuts, cheese, lentils and soy chorizo. But arent they hungry? Growing kids need  protein!  they'd say. Comments like that put me in the position of being a pediatric nutritionist, which was awkward because I know so little beyond the food guide pyramidand Ive heard thats changed since I was in fifth grade. In each conversation, there were so many underlying assumptions: You guys must never eat out. You must eat a lot of beans. You must fart a lot. Your kids must hate you. You all must miss bacon. Every time I walked away from a discussion about food, I wondered: Why cant we all just eat what works for us and get on with our lives? I get that most of the comments were born of misinformation and the highly politicized climate we live in. Most people, underneath their shock and threats to call child protective services, were expressing curiosity about  what we put in our mouths day after day . I was able to forgive much of the tone and tenor of the things they said. Except for one guy. At school picnic, he found out we didnt eat meat and began taunting my kids with comments like, Dont you miss meat? Dont you wish your pizza had pepperoni on it? He went on and on. Its one thing to debate and question me; its quite another to bypass me and start cross-examining my children. Thats just uncool. I didnt walk up to his kids and mock his parenting decisions. FOR YOU:  Tips for Feeding Vegetarian Kids Why, as soon as meat is on the chopping block, do people think its okay to openly debate and dissect my familys choices? So I dont talk about it. Instead, I steer the conversation toward less controversial topics, like politics and global warming. Whats been the reaction when you tell people your family follows a vegetarian or vegan (or something else) diet? 3 Things to Read Next Toddler Eating and Nutrition Tips 23 Toddler-Friendly Ideas for Healthy Snacks 8 Ways to Pack Protein Into Your Childs Diet"

No one wants to see that..."" etc., etc.  And this Dad has had enough . To highlight how ridiculous it is that anyone would  expect  a mom to feed her child under a piece of fabric, Brock Smith ate a meal in a restaurant with a blanket covering his face and shoulders. Unsurprisingly, he struggles to drink from a straw and fumbles with his utensils, prompting him to delcare he might as well ""eat in a bathroom.""     Melanoma Therapy   Learn About an Advanced   Melanoma Treatment Option Here.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       ""For people to be ignorant enough to harass a mother trying to have a normal life while breastfeeding a child just infuriates us,"" Smith said about the video. ""We have never been harassed ourselves, but we hear all the horror stories from friends and social media."" How and whether you breastfeed in public depends on your personal boundaries. If you prefer to use a scarf or find a secluded area, then that's what's best for you and baby. But it's absurd  kind of like this viral video  for anyone to impose their own discomfort on a mom and her child. So way to go, Brock. You shouldn't be forced to eat under a blanket. And moms shouldn't be forced to use one."

My wife and I heard those words dozens of times before our son was born. It may sound ridiculous, but never dining in a restaurant became one of the things I worried most about before becoming a parent. I wasn't ready to give it upnot without a fight. Our first meal out with our newborn was spontaneous. We were on our way home from the pediatrician. There was await for the bus, and my wife and I were hungry. My wife was carrying our son in a wrap, and he stayed asleep through most of the meal. He woke up to nurse and coo at us. We passed him back and forth, taking turns eating bites of our food, just like we did at home. It was awkward, but the three of us could handle it.     MDD Treatment   Learn About A Treatment Option   For Major Depressive Disorder   www.depression-add-on-medication.com       Our next adventure didnt go nearlyas well. But eventually, through trial and error and taking our son out to eat often, we were able to learn how to dine out with our growing childand not only inkid friendly restaurants. First, we began eating out more often with friends. A game of pass-the-baby is more fun themore adults you have around the tableand gives everyone a chance to get in more than a bite or two of dinner at a time. We also started favoring establishments with booths, because they afforded a place to set the baby down. Finally, we learned that most waitstaff and dining patrons are actually good-natured about having a cute baby in the restaurant. Taking my son to eat out became a totally different experience  once he started eating solid foods . We took a  baby-led weaning approach  to introduce him to the wide world of food, which meant that he could usually sample most of what we were ordering. We quickly learned that he was excited about trying new things. That made getting out of the house for a meal easier on everyone. Servers regularly offered him special foods and then laughed when he wildly wielded an asparagus spear. (We always packed extra baby wipes to clean up the baby, table and the floor!)    When my sons  first birthday  rolled around, we werent sure how to celebrate. We were having a little party that weekend, but we also wanted the day itself to be special. Finally, it hit me: I knew the thing my one-year-old would most appreciate. We would take him to his favorite sushi restaurant for lunch. Knowing what our son likes and because it was his birthday, we ordered extra avocado sushi. It was a good thing, too, because he put away nearly two rolls by himself. As I sat there, enjoying my own meal and watching the server giggle at him absolutely covered in sticky rice, I couldnt help but think about how far we had all come from those nervous early days.    All I had wanted was to share the joy of eating with my child, and with a little effort and a little letting go, I was able to.   3 Things to Read Next: Baby Health and Safety Tips Baby-Led Weaning 101 Your Guide to Starting Solids"

This Dad Ate His Wife's Placenta and Now He's Making a Movie About It,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/this-dad-ate-his-wifes-placenta-and-how-hes-making-a-movie-about-it,"Humans are the only species that don't consistently eat  the placenta  after labor and delivery. Being the evolutionary exception to the rule bothered weird-food expert and father-of-two  Eddie Lin . So when his wife Diane, who'd had a difficult pregnancy and wanted extra help recovering postpartum, decided to try placentophagy (aka eating your placenta ), Lin was on board. The placenta went home from the hospital in a biohazard bag, and Lin called his mom (obviously) to ask for tips on preparing it. Lin's mother cooked a few ounces of the organ in a traditional Chinese broth, and Lin and Diane ate it right out of the cooking pot. He got it all on film, and four years later he's using the footage (and much more) in a documentary, titled American Afterbirth . Lin shared a first look at the moviethis week, along with  a kickstarter page  to crowdfund the project. In an interview with  What to Expect , Lin said that he's about a third of the way through filming and in the coming months, hopes to secure interviews with a wide range of moms, from reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian to midwife and humanitarian Robin Lim. This is the first documentary on eating placenta, according to Lin. The film explores the tradition of placentophagy in ancient communities (it may go back more than 5,000 years!), medical research, some culinary insights and the benefits according to midwives and women who've done it. Lin also spoke with mom and raw vegan chef Christina Ross (featured in the trailer) and encouraged her to eat her placenta, which she hadn't previously considered. So Lin prepped it for her like steak tartare, using the placenta in place of raw beef, topping it with a quail egg and adding seaweed salad on the side, per Ross' request. Ross' partner loved it so much that he couldn't stop eating it, Lin says, and Ross froze the rest of her placenta so she could put it into smoothies. So far, Lin says that his favorite interview has been with Andrew Zimmern, the host of  Bizarre Foods  on the Travel Channel, primarily because of its entertainment value. ""It's fun to talk with chefs about how they'd prepare placenta,"" Lin says. ""Some don't even know what a placenta is.""In case you were wondering, Lin says it has a delicate taste, nothing like the gamey, livery flavor he was expecting. SEE ALSO: This Close-Up Video of a Placenta Shows Exactly How Mom Connects to Baby If you're considering placentophagy yourself, it's worth noting that there isn't much scientific evidence to indicate that eating the placenta has any benefits, and most medical experts attribute the perceived positive results to the placebo effect. What's more, some women do get sick after eating their placentas, and there's a very real possibility of spreading infection when handling or consuming a human organ -- especially one that doctors know so little about . That said,  American Afterbirth  looks like a fascinating peek into a trendy topic with old roots that matters to many moms. But a word of caution: Based on the placenta footage in the trailer, this is one film that's not for the faint of heart!"

The 5 Things I Can't Wait to Eat After I Have This Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/the-5-things-i-can-t-wait-to-eat-after-i-have-this-baby.aspx,"Hi! I'm a pregnant woman, and I like to eat. Actually, when I'm  not  pregnant, I like to eat; eating is too challenging when I'm pregnant. You see, many doctors and midwives and such give us pregnant ladies a list of items that we should steer away from while pregnant. Said list usually includes foods that I absolutely love. Sure, I don't mind withdrawing myself from these delectables for a smooth 10 months. But when I've popped this baby out and when my breastfeeding appetite has gone berserk, to these items I will return! SEE ALSO:   Foods to Avoid During Pregnancy     Melanoma Therapy   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Raw fish . Mmmm, raw fish. I know it's not for everyone but, man, I love sushi and raw fish. I've had to pretend that I hate it during pregnancy because I know it's something I shouldn't be eating ( the risk of ingesting bacteria and parasites is too high ). Of course, I'd only eat at restaurants whose fish I trust anyways, but the risk just isn't worth it. I've had to turn down so many sushi dates or settle for sushi rolls that I don't like. My kid can never question my love for him -- just look at the things us mothers do for our babies. Tiramisu . I've got a sweet tooth like you wouldn't believe. I'd rather give up meat, bread and anything else, but take away my sweets and we have a serious problem. One of my favorite desserts is tiramisu and as tasty as it is, it just isn't pregnancy-friendly for this mama. The espresso in this stuff sends the baby in my belly on a gymnastics course. I know this because I ""accidentally"" consumed a tiramisu months ago. I was left with a battered tummy and insane mommy guilt. My baby's fine, of course. But Mama's not. Mama needs tiramisu! A pina colada . This summer my family visited Puerto Rico. While most of them left to tour an alcohol distillery, this pregnant mama was left behind with a toddler and teenager. It was funny at the time but hearing everyone talk about how much fun it was to get the history behind mixed drinks made me a tad bit jealous -- and I'm not even a drinker. That said, after I birth this baby, I will treat myself to a fabulous pina colada. It has to be milky, creamy, tangy and full of flavor. If I can't have this said beverage on a beach somewhere, can it at least be somewhere quiet where I can visualize the beach? Mmmm, I can taste it now! Runny eggs . You don't know love until you've had the golden ooze of an egg yolk cascade over a slice of salmon, a bed of greens and onto a perfectly toasted English muffin. I have never craved Eggs Benedict so much more in my life than when I got pregnant and wasn't able to indulge ( due to the risk of salmonella ). I'll be sure to have all of the ingredients needed to make my Eggs Benedict the morning after baby is born. In fact, I will likely consume it daily for a good week or so. Cold deli meat . I struggled with missing this with my first pregnancy and the desire to consume sub after sub is still hitting me heavily. It really makes no sense considering I don't even eat that many  subs with deli meat  when I'm not pregnant. But you sometimes don't know what you've got until it's gone. Oh, how I desire a good foot-long sub with layers and layers of smoked turkey, cheese and veggies! Maybe I'll indulge in one after I have my post-birth Eggs Benedict.

A Former Binge Eater ‘Opens the Closet Door’,,
Listeria Exposure During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/listeria-during-pregnancy/,"At your first prenatal visit, your health care provider likely talked with you about all the foods you should avoid during pregnancy  sushi, raw meat, deli meat and unpasteurized cheese to prevent exposure to listeria. That's because consuming this bacteria can sometimes make you sick, and that extremely unlikely possibility becomes more likely when you're expecting. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to greatly reduce your risk. Here's how, along with what happens if you think you've been exposed. What is listeriosis? Listeriosis is an illness caused by eating foods contaminated with thelisteria monocytogenesbacteria.Keep in mind that simply being exposed to listeria, however, doesn't mean you'll develop an infection. In fact, most women who are exposed to listeria will not develop a listeriosis infection. The risk of listeriosis during pregnancy While the odds of being infected with listeriosis is still very, very low, it is significantly (13 times) higher during pregnancy and the potential of its causing problems in pregnancy is higher. Listeria, unlike many other germs, enters the bloodstream directly and therefore can get to the baby quickly through the placenta (other food contaminants generally stay in the digestive tract). And an untreated infection can put baby at increased risk of more serious complications, including miscarriage, preterm labor, stillbirth or meningitis in newborns. ADVERTISING Symptoms of listeriosis Listeriosis can be hard to detect, partly because symptoms can develop up to two months after eating contaminated food and can vary from severe to mild. If you think you may have eaten food that contains listeria, watch for flu-like symptoms including: Fever over 100.6F Muscle pain Backache Headache Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea Note that you may have fever only, or you might not have any symptoms at all. So it's important to contact your doctor even if you think what you're experiencing might be caused by something else. If you think you've been exposed to listeria In many cases, a watch-and-wait approach for symptoms is all that's necessary. Ifyou're experiencing symptoms and your doctor syspects a listeriosis infection, he may order  blood or other various tests  to check for the bacteria and monitor your baby's health. If you have been infected, you'll get a prescription for antibiotics. What should you do to protect yourself One of the best ways to prevent listeriosis is to avoid foods that are most likely to be contaminated. These include: Hot dogs, lunch meats or cold cuts that are cold or heated lower than 165 degrees Refrigerated pt and meat spreads Refrigerated, smoked seafood (like smoked salmon) Unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses (like feta, queso blanco, Brie and blue-veined cheeses) Unpasteurized fresh fruit and veggie juice (if you're not sure whether a juice has been pasteurized, don't drink it) Unwashed, raw produce Alfalfa and other sprouts A few more tips to stay safe: Always wash produce (including those organic blueberries from the farmer's market) thoroughly in running tap water, even if you're planning to peel or cook it. As a precaution, even ready-cooked meats should be heated to steaming before eating. When eating out, watch for signs that the restaurant doesn't follow basic sanitation rules (and it should be pretty obvious): Perishable foods are kept at room temperature, the bathrooms are unclean, it's open season for flies, etc. Unfortunately it's impossible to know for sure if the food you buy today will be recalled tomorrow making it impossible to avoid listeria entirely. That said, the risk of contracting the infection from day-to-day eating is extremely low, even if you are expecting. So try not to let worries about possible food contamination consume you. Instead,spend your energy focusing on what you  can  do: Eat a balanced, healthy pregnancy diet to help support you and your growing baby. Updated 5/6/16"
"79 Percent of Parents Make This Feeding Mistake, Survey Says",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/0706/the-feeding-mistake-seventy-nine-percent-of-parents-make,"Do you know how much to feed your toddler? According to a new survey, you may be serving too much. The survey, conductedby the UK's Infant and Toddler Forum , an educational website for parents, and supported by an unrestricted educational grant from food manufacturer Danone UK, included 1,000 British parents of preschoolers. Researchers gave the parents photos of different portions of food and asked which they thought was most appropriate for their child. Of these 1,000 parents, 79 percent selected pictures of portions bigger than what's recommended for a preschooler or toddler. Think anywhere from a couple of spoonfuls extra to the same amount Mom and Dad get. In fact, the survey found some 10 percent of parents gave kids close to adult-sized portions . Serving too much food (especially if kids are encouraged to finish what's on their plate) is one of many factors, like lack of exercise and an unbalanced diet, than can lead to unhealthy weight gain. Recent estimates say one in three American kids is overweight or obese . Following serving size guidelines  can be challenging, especially  when restaurant portions are often double what's recommended  and you can count the foods your child will eat on one hand. Still, it's good to at least try to introduce a balanced diet early. Heres a cheat sheet for toddler-sized portions of the most common foods: Fresh fruit: 1/4 cup Cooked fruit: 2 tbsp Cooked veggies: 1 to 2 tbsp Meat, fish, poultry: 1 oz Bread: 1/4 slice Crackers: 2 small Cold cereal: 1/4 cup Oatmeal: 2 tbsp Cooked pasta/rice/grains: 2 tbsp Beans: 2 tbsp Cottage cheese: 1 oz Egg: 1/2 Yogurt: 1/4 cup Cheese: 1/2 oz or 2 tbsp grated Concerned about your toddlers notoriously picky palate ? Youre not alone  73 percent of parents in the survey worried that their kids werent eating enough, double the number of parents who worried their kids ate too much. While it might seem like serving more may encourage your child to eat, little ones can become overwhelmed by too much food, so youre better off keeping portions small and offering seconds if he or she is still hungry. And keep in mind that toddler eating patterns are unpredictable: One day your child might scarf down breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the next hardly touch a plate. Aim to serve three well-proportioned meals supplemented with snacks at the same times every day. Then let your child eat as much (or as little) as he or she wants without pressure to eat more. Healthy kids eat what they need, and variations in a week will even themselves out."

These Whole Foods Ready Meals Could Cause Miscarriage in Pregnant Women,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0615/ready-to-eat-whole-foods-items-could-be-deadly-for-pregnant-women,"Over the course of several inspections in February of a Whole Foods' kitchen in Massachusetts, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) staff found multiple violations, including the presence of listeria on a food prep surface. The bacteria is especially dangerous to pregnant women. FDA reps sent a letter to Whole Foods  last week describing the listeria contamination. After swabbing 100 surfaces throughout the facility, inspectors found a swab from the vegetable chopping machine tested positive for listeria. According to the FDA, this indicated that other surfaces were at risk of growing listeria, as well. Whole Foods Market North Atlantic Kitchen prepares ready meals for 74 stores inMassachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey,  according to its Facebook page . Kitchen staff may have altered cleaning and food prep practices since the inspections.             Psoriasis Treatment    Learn About a Treatment Option for Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis   www.informationaboutpsoriasis.com         But to be safe, if you are pregnant, avoid prepared meals, including salad bars, chefs' cases, sandwiches and wraps, in Whole Foods in the Northeast, especially those with chopped vegetables. The letter also outlined several other concerning violations, including: Ceiling condensation dripping on to preparation surfaces and food storage spaces Dirty dishes piling up near food High pressure hoses used for cleaning spraying into food prep areas Too much acid in solutions used to soak and treat vegetables Employees not washing their hands between tasks Inadequate hot water at some sinks Sanitizer to clean surfaces accidentally sprayed onto foods Employee clothing touching foods These violations affectedat leastthe following ready meals: Pesto pasta Mushroom quesadillas Egg salad Anything with chives and beets Couscous Quinoa cakes Anything with leafy salad greens Chicken, turkey and other meats Enchiladas Salad dressings Whole Foods reps say they've addressed all of the problems listed in the letter and they don't know why the FDA didn't acknowledge these changes when they sent the letter months later. FDA reps say Whole Foods' response efforts up to this point have been inadequate, in part because Whole Foods management has not yet shared a plan for forcing this facility to comply with FDA regulations in the future. Last year, Whole Foods recalled deli pasta and curry chicken made at the same kitchen due to listeria contamination. Listeria is especially harmful to pregnant women, who are 13 times more likely to develop listeriosis if they come in contact with it though in general the risk is still very low. Unlike most other bacteria, listeria enters the bloodstream directly, and it can pass through the placenta, potentially causing miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and meningitis in newborns. Common listeriosis symptoms includefever over 100.6F, muscle pain, backache, headache and diarrhea.

Tips for Handling Toddler Food Rejection,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/eating-and-nutrition/tips-for-handling-toddler-food-rejection/,"It's the rare toddler who loves everything at first bite. It often takes five, 10, even  15  attempts before your budding gourmand accepts (and swallows) a new food. Remember, you're not only dealing with super-sensitive taste buds but also with a growing desire to be assertive (you can put it on my plate, Mom, but you can't make me eat it!). Fortunately, almost all toddlers will eat when they're really hungry, but while you're waiting, here are some tactics for feeding your finicky one. In This Series   toddler Whole and Organic Food for Toddlers   toddler Family Meals   toddler The Toddler Diet: Flexible Feeding   toddler Vegetables for Toddlers   toddler Toddler Drinks: Limit the Liquids   toddler Recommended Carbs for Toddlers Go with the flow.  Toddlers usually need to give food a full examination before they taste it. They'll touch and mash and sniff it before it actually makes it into their mouths. Don't let it get to you. The more matter-of-fact you are about foods (and eating), the less likely your toddler will be to turn mealtime into mayhem. Start small . Sometimes size matters. A mountain of food (no matter what food) can overwhelm a little eater  causing her to give up before she's started. Keeping portions small will make it easier to negotiate. Come back with combos.  Some toddlers reject new foods simply because they're not bland enough. In that case, try adding a little bit of the new, more flavorful food to a bland one she already likes (for instance, add a touch of peas to her brown rice). Gradually add more, until you can serve each separately. And just so you know: Almost all kids outgrow ultra-sensitive palates. Switch gears.  You never know what'll tickle a toddler's taste buds  or turn her stomach. Sometimes even favorite foods suddenly get the ick-treatment. In that case, try serving it in a different dish or using a new spoon, or preparing it hot instead of cold, dry instead of with milk, as a finger food instead of spoon-fed, or grated with cheese instead of plain. The point is to do whatever it takes (within reason) to pique her interest and get her to gobble it up. Fork it over.  Boost your toddler's budding independence and fine motor skills by giving her a set of her own kid-size utensils. You just might find that the novelty of feeding herself outweighs her impulse to reject her meal. Try family style . Eating as a family may encourage your toddler to eat more adventurously. Pass around a bowl of pasta with veggies and pesto or a plate of teriyaki salmon and brown rice, and you may be surprised to see your tot reach for a taste. Give it a break . Matter-of-factly take the rejected food away, and don't serve it up  or bring it up  for at least a week (unless it's asked for). In the meantime, offer nutritionally similar foods  if it's frozen waffles that have gotten the cold shoulder, serve pancakes. If it's yogurt, try cottage cheese. If it's apples, try bananas. Do bring it back with a twist . When you return the rejected food to the menu, serve it with a different spin. Cereal for lunch instead of for breakfast. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich rolled up and cut into pinwheels instead of standard squares. Grilled cheese made with mozzarella cheese instead of American. Don't write off rejected foods . What's off the menu today may be back on tomorrow, so don't give up (yet). If fact, if a food strike is triggered by teething discomfort or a soon-to-appear cold, it may be back in favor once your little one is feeling like her usual self.

20 Common Pregnancy Symptoms,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/most-common-pregnancy-symptoms/,"While there are many reasons to be thankful when youre expecting,  pregnancy symptoms  arent among them. From fatigue and morning sickness to pregnancy brain and bloating, here are some of the common symptoms you may experience, along with tricks that can help ease the discomfort. READ MORE: Early Signs & Symptoms of Pregnancy Common Pregnancy Symptoms in the First Trimester Fatigue .  Making a baby is hard work! Youre so down-and-out tired in  the first trimester   because it takes a lot of energy to produce a baby and a placenta -- plus your metabolism has spiked but your blood sugar and pressure havent caught up yet. Cut yourself some slack. Get some extra sleep, eat a healthy  pregnancy diet  with lots of complex carbs and protein, and try to break a sweat with  a pregnancy-safe workout  -- even if that just means a walk around the block. Morning sickness .  Changing hormones take most of the blame for the queasies, along with stress, genetics and fatigue. For now, stick to the foods you know wont upset your stomach; eat small, frequent meals; cut back on processed and greasy/fatty foods; eat fresh ginger or drink ginger tea; take your prenatal vitamin (B6 helps with nausea); drink lots of water; and try sucking on lemon candies. If all else fails, talk to your doctor about other possible remedies, including prescription medication and a switch to a prenatal vitamin with higher doses of B6. Food cravings and aversions .  Got a sudden urge for a particular food? Suddenly cant stand even the sight of your formerly favorite snack? Welcome to pregnancy cravings and aversions, and thank your raging pregnancy hormones. Try to avoid going overboard when cravings hit; if theyre overwhelming, find something else to distract you. For aversions, focus on eating small meals containing only the foods you can stomach right now. Heightened sensitivity to smell .  If everything from your coworkers perfume to your partners tuna salad overwhelm your nose, its due to those pregnancy hormones again, specifically estrogen. Try to wash your clothes more frequently and surround yourself with ginger and lemon scents, which tend to help ease nausea, too. If you feel comfortable, you could ask those close to you to tone down the strong offending scents too. Common Pregnancy Symptoms in the Second Trimester Increased energy.  After what may have been a grueling first months, the  second trimester  is notorious for being the most comfortable and energetic of all three as your body becomes accustomed to pregnancy. Enjoy it while it lasts! Increased appetite .  Your appetite is likely to surge again in the second trimester as your body needs more energy to feed your growing baby. So listen to it, but remember: You only need about 350 calories more than what you were eating before you conceived -- thats only equivalent to, say, a homemade turkey sandwich. Mild swelling . Your body retains extra water, especially around your feet and ankles, thanks to increased fluids and blood flow that nourish you and your growing baby. Try to avoid standing or sitting for too long, kick up your feet when you can, sleep on your side to help your kidneys move along waste, wear support hose and comfy shoes, drink lots of water, and try to work out as often as you feel up to it. Pregnancy brain . Extra forgetful lately? Lots of factors can explain a case of brain fog, including lack of sleep, as well as actual pregnancy-induced  changes in your brain that may possibly help prepare you for motherhood  (i.e. increased empathy as well as decreased brain cell volume in some regions). To keep sane, jot important to-do's down, delegate where possible, and eat lots of brain-boosting  choline-rich foods  as well as those that are a  good source of DHA . Stretch marks . You may notice fine red lines on your skin beginning in your second trimester of pregnancy as your tummy stretches, resulting in tiny tears in the supporting layers of tissue underneath. While genetics and your coloring play a big part in whether or not youll notice stretch marks (lighter skin is more susceptible), keeping  your pregnancy weight gain in check , moisturizing with cocoa butter and eating plenty of vitamin C foods can help minimize their appearance. Common Pregnancy Symptoms in the Third Trimester Fatigue.  Following a surge of energy in the second trimester, fatigue comes back with a vengeance in  the third trimester . Continue to give yourself a rest as you need it; eat healthy, frequent meals; and try to fit in whatever workouts you can handle to boost your energy levels. Achiness in the lower abdomen .  Otherwise known as round ligament pain, these sharp or crampy growing pains in your mid-section are due to your expanding uterus, which pulls on the ligaments that run from your groin to your abdomen. Youll likely notice it more when you change positions, laugh or sneeze. To ease the aches, try wearing a belly band and avoid sudden movements. Frequent urination . One of the first signs of pregnancy for some women, the urge to pee will kick back in again in the third trimester as your growing baby bump puts added pressure on your bladder. When you urinate, lean forward to help empty your bladder; try to avoid caffeine; and keep drinking lots of water ( dehydration  can be dangerous during pregnancy as well as possibly leading to a  urinary tract infection ). Shortness of breath .  Pregnancy hormones wind up triggering frequent and deeper breaths to bring oxygen to your rapidly growing baby. At the same time they relax the muscles of your respiratory tract -- sometimes making you feel like you simply cant get enough air. Not to mention the fact that your blossoming babe and uterus are compressing organs including your lungs. So try to sit up straight to give your lungs more room to breathe, and dont push yourself too hard when you work out (or even walk around). Braxton hicks contractions .  These practice contractions -- which are a painless tightening of your abdomen that you may not even notice -- start around week 20 and continue through the remainder of your pregnancy as your bodys way of prepping you for labor. Keep drinking water and working out to minimize the discomfort, and  learn what real labor contractions feel like . Symptoms That Are Common Throughout Pregnancy Bloating and gas.   All that gas is an unfortunate side effect of pregnancy hormones, which cause your digestive system to slow down. Itll likely get worse as your uterus grows and presses on your stomach and intestines. Eat lots of frequent, small, fiber-filled meals to keep things moving; drink plenty of water; and avoid notoriously gas-inducing foods like beans, cabbage, onions and fried/fatty/sugary treats. Breast tenderness and changes .  Your breasts will feel the most tender in the first trimester, though they will continue to grow, change and be sensitive throughout pregnancy thanks again to those hormones. Get a quality, comfortable maternity bra now and wear a cotton sports bra to bed if necessary. Constipation .  If youre having trouble getting things moving, pregnancy hormones are slowing down digestion by causing your intestinal muscles to relax. Try to eat at least 25g of fiber-rich foods every day (whole grains, fresh fruits and veggies) with some probiotics (like yogurt) and drink lots of water. And stay away from stimulant laxatives. Difficulty sleeping .  Three in four expecting women have some trouble sleeping at some point -- whether it's because of more bathroom trips overnight, general discomfort, leg cramps, congestion, snoring or plain old insomnia. To get more shut-eye, try to avoid caffeine and sugar, especially in the hours before bedtime; work out daily if you can manage it; and do something relaxing -- like taking a bath or having sex -- just before bedtime. Heartburn . That burning feeling happens as pregnancy hormones relax the muscles in your upper stomach, allowing acids to splash up into your esophagus. In the third trimester, your expanding uterus pushes your stomach (and its acids) upward. To minimize the burn, watch your weight, avoid heartburn-inducing (greasy, spicy and citric) foods, and eat frequent, small meals. To treat heartburn, take an antacid like Tums and, if youve got a really bad case, ask your doc about using an OTC proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 blocker. Changes in vaginal discharge .  Expect an increase in white, milky and mild-smelling vaginal discharge caused by your bodys boosted estrogen production, which increases blood flow and stimulates mucus membranes. If it gets excessive, wear a pad. Avoid douching or using special soaps meant to decrease the odor, since both can disrupt your bodys natural chemistry down there. Remember, all women and pregnancies are different, so if you don't experience most (or any!) of these during the trimesters they're particularly common, or have others that aren't on the list, don't worry. If there's any symptom you're not sure about, just check in with your practitioner. And though pregnancy symptoms can be a drag, there are plenty of expectant mom moments that aren't. Whatever your pregnancy looks and feels like, the reward at the end -- a beautiful baby who's all yours in your arms -- is well worth it.  3 Things to Read Next: Natural Remedies for Common Pregnancy Symptoms Dizziness During Pregnancy Surprising Pregnancy Symptoms for Dads"

The Most Unhealthy Fast Food Meal in America,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/family-life/0703/the-most-unhealthy-fast-food-meal-in-america.aspx,"SUMMARY: The Center for Science in the Public Interest has completed laboratory tests showing that the most unhealthy fast food meal is the Big Catch from Long John Silver's. It's packed with fat and sodium, two of the worst offenders for promoting heart disease and high blood pressure. New research reveals what NOT to feed your kids. Extensive lab testing has determined the most unhealthy fast food in America: a fat-laden and sodium-packed fish meal from the restaurant Long John Silver's. According to the  Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI ) , the Big Catch meal is a ""heart attack on a hook."" The meal consists of a piece of battered haddock, hush puppies (deep fried cornmeal), and onion rings. It delivers 3,700 milligrams of sodium, which promotes high blood pressure and stroke, along with 19 grams of saturated fat and about 1,320 calories.     Melanoma Therapy   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Most concerning, however, is the astonishing 33 grams of trans fat in this fast food meal. That's more than 16 times higher than the daily limit recommended by the  American Heart Association . Both saturated fat and trans fat are strong promoters of heart disease. Part of the problem is rooted in the partially hydrogenated oil used to fry the food. Many restaurant chains have stopped using this kind of oil altogether because of recent bad publicity, lawsuits, and government restrictions. But Long John Silver's is still using this type of oil for frying. Another problem is the fish itself. CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobsen notes that the company is taking an essentially healthy fish and ruining it by covering it with an oily crust. The company advertises its Big Catch as a 7 oz. piece of haddock, but the CSPI lab found that it's only about a 4 oz. piece of fish plus a 3 oz. crust of fat-drenched batter. The CSPI officially notified Long John Silver's CEO that the chain will face a lawsuit if it continues to use partially hydrogenated oils in food preparation. CSPI officials also notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its findings and urged the agency to withdraw its approval of these unhealthy oils, banning their use altogether. What does this mean for parents? For one thing, this particular meal is one to avoid if you're  taking the kids out to dinner . But on an even more basic level, it's a reminder that fast food in general can be alarmingly unhealthy and should be limited. Nutritional information on fast food menus may be skewed (as the CSPI found with Long John Silver's menu), so even ""healthy"" items may seem healthier than they really are. The bottom line is what nutritionists, researchers, and government agencies have been telling us for decades: Eat more fruits and veggies, and  eat less fast food .

Introducing Solid Foods to Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/introducing-solid-foods/,"Introducing solid foods is one of the most exciting (if messy) milestones of your baby's first year. Think of all the tastes and textures that await your little one  from savory cheese to juicy mango to creamy avocado. There's a whole world of flavors to discover and explore, and starting solids is the first step. Encourage your baby to enjoy herself while trying new foods, even if a good portion of them ends up on her bib, the tray or the floor. It's all part of the great experiment of taking those taste buds to the next level. WHEN CAN MY BABY START SOLIDS? Most babies are ready to start solids between 4 and 6 months, but your little one's individual development definitely tops the list when deciding whether or not it's time to graduate to a more varied diet. Though you might be eager to hop on the feeding bandwagon sooner rather than later, there are plenty of reasons why starting a baby on solids too soon isn't smart. First, a very early introduction to solids can occasionally trigger allergies. And a young baby's digestive system  from a tongue that pushes out any foreign substance placed on it, to intestines still lacking many digestive enzymes  is unready developmentally for solids. Plus, solids aren't necessary early on  babies can fill all their nutritional needs for the first 6 months of life from breast milk or formula alone. Bringing on the solids too soon can also undermine future eating habits (baby may reject those spoonfuls initially simply because she isn't ready, then may reject them later because of previous parental pushing). And especially in formula-fed babies, early introduction of solids can lead to obesity later on in childhood and beyond. On the other hand, waiting too long  say, until 8 or 9 months  can also lead to potential pitfalls. An older baby may resist being taught the new (and challenging) tricks of chewing and swallowing solids, preferring to cling to the tried-and-true (and easy) methods of breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. And, like habits, tastes can be harder to change at this point. Unlike the more pliable younger baby, an older baby may not be as open to solids when milky liquids have long monopolized the menu. SIGNS MY BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDS To decide if your baby is ready for the big step into the world of solid foods at 4 months, not till 6 months, or somewhere in between, look for the following clues  and then consult your doctor: Your baby can  hold her head up  well when propped to sit. Even strained baby foods should not be offered until then. Chunkier foods should wait until a baby can  sit well alone , usually not until 7 months. The tongue thrust reflex has disappeared. Try this test: Place a tiny bit of baby-appropriate food thinned with breast milk or formula in your baby's mouth from the tip of a baby spoon or your finger. If the food comes right back out again with that tiny tongue, and continues to after several tries, the thrust is still present and baby isn't ready for spoon-feeding. Your baby reaches for and otherwise shows an interest in table foods. If she's grabbing the fork out of your hand or watching intently and excitedly with every bite you take, that may be a sign that she's hungry for more grown-up fare. Your baby is able to make back-and-forth and up-and-down movements with the tongue. How can you tell? Just watch carefully. Your little one is able to open wide, so that food can be taken from a spoon. WHAT ARE THE BEST FIRST FOODS TO FEED BABY? No matter what's on the menu, the texture of your  baby's first foods  should be super smooth and practically dripping off the spoon. If you prepare your own food, you should strain, puree or finely mash it, and then thin it with liquid if necessary. As your baby becomes a more experienced eater (usually around 7 months or older), gradually reduce the liquid you add and thicken the texture. Here are three foods to start with: Cereal.  If you start with baby cereal, pick a single-grain, iron-enriched, whole-grain variety, like brown rice, whole-grain oat or whole-grain barley. To prepare, mix a small amount of baby cereal with formula, breast milk or even water to create a creamy ""soup."" Don't sweeten the taste by adding things like mashed bananas, applesauce or juice  first, because it's best to introduce only one food at a time, and second, because it's better for baby to acquire a taste for plain before you sweeten the cereal pot. Vegetables.  Start with milder yellow or orange options such as sweet potatoes and carrots before moving on to the green team, like peas and string beans, which have slightly stronger flavors. If your baby rejects what you give her, try again tomorrow and the next day and the next. Some babies need to be introduced to a new food four or five (or more!) times before they'll accept it, so perseverance is key. Fruit.  Delicious, digestible first fruits include finely mashed bananas, baby applesauce, peaches and pears. For something completely different, and completely baby-friendly, start with smoothed-down mashed or pureed ripe avocado  it's creamy, yummy and loaded with healthy fats. Otherwise, you might want to adopt an approach that's often called "" baby-led weaning ,"" which bypasses pureed solids in favor of gummable solid foods presented in thick, long pieces, which younger babies can hold in their fists. (However, the  pincer grasp , which enables babies to make the leap to finger foods, doesn't usually develop until around month 8.) HOW CAN I HELP INTRODUCE SOLID FOODS TO MY BABY? One of the first and best steps in raising a good eater is to model healthy enjoyment of food yourself. Babies who see adults eating good food and enjoying it are more likely to be interested in following their example. A few more tips to help your baby discover solids: Time it right.   The ""perfect"" time of day to feed your baby is whatever time works for both of you. If you're  breastfeeding , you might try solids when your milk supply is at its lowest (probably late afternoon or early evening). Experiment: Offer a first course of formula or breast milk to whet that appetite, then bring on the solids. Start with one meal per day, then move up to two (probably a morning and evening meal) for the next month or so. Monitor baby's mood . As trying as those first feedings may be for you, they're even more of a challenge for your little one. So keep in mind that a baby who's cheerful and alert is more likely to open wide for an incoming spoon, and one who's cranky or getting sleepy may want only breast (or bottle). If your baby is fussy, be flexible  you might want to skip solids at that meal and try them next time. Don't rush . Food is never fast when it comes to babies  you'll be surprised at how long it takes to get one little spoonful into that little mouth (and ultimately down the hatch). Give yourself and your baby plenty of time for feedings  and get plenty of practice, too. You'll need it. Sit pretty.  Holding a squirming baby on your lap while trying to deposit an unfamiliar substance into an unreceptive mouth is a perfect recipe for disaster. Before your baby actually takes bite one, let her practice sitting in the high chair or feeding seat for a couple of days, adjusting the height of the tray or seat so it fits just right. And dont forget how wiggly your little worm can be  always fasten the safety straps, including the one around the crotch. If baby cant sit up at all in such a chair or seat, it's probably a good idea to postpone solids a little longer. Gear up.  Skip the silver spoon  a silicone, plastic or corn-based model with a small, soft bowl is much easier on tender gums. Count on having several on hand during feedings (one for you, one for baby and a spare when one lands on the floor) to foster baby's sense of independence and avoid power struggles (yes, those happen even at this age). And while youre gearing up, a word to the wise: Don't forget to put a bib on baby right from the start or youll face big-time resistance later. Make some introductions.  Before even attempting to bring spoon to mouth, put a dab of the food on the table or high chair tray and give baby a chance to examine it, squish it, mash it, rub it and maybe even taste it. That way, when you do approach with the spoon, what youre offering wont be totally unfamiliar. Ease in.  For someone whos brand new to the concept of spoon-feeding  and all the new textures that go with it  solids can come as a bit of a shock. So ease in. Start by gently placing about a quarter teaspoon of food on the tip of babys tongue. If thats swallowed, place the next quarter teaspoon a little farther back. At first, expect almost as much food to come in as goes out. Eventually your little one will get the hang of spoon-feeding  and respond mouth-open. Count on rejection.  Even bland tastes can be acquired tastes for a brand new solids eater. Babies may  reject a new food  several times or more before they decide to like it. So dont push when baby snubs what the spoon is delivering. But do try again another day. Invite imitation.  What your baby monkey sees, she may be more likely to do. It's an old parent trick but a goodie: Open up wide and take a pretend taste from the spoon  and don't forget to smack your lips and relish your make-believe bite enthusiastically. Know when enough is enough.  Knowing when it's time to stop feeding is as important as knowing when to start. A turned head or a clenched mouth are sure signs that baby is finished with this meal. Forcing a baby to eat is always a lost cause  and can actually set up future food fights. Need more help? These extra  tips introducing solid foods  to your baby should do the trick. WATCH FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONS While  food allergies  are pretty common in babies, kids usually outgrow them  though you do need to take them seriously. Babies' reactions to food can range from gassiness, diarrhea or mucus in the stool to vomiting and rashes  especially around the mouth or bottom. Other symptoms include a runny nose, watery eyes, wheezing that doesn't seem to be due to a cold and unusual wakefulness or crankiness, day or night. If you think your baby may be allergic to something you've fed her, wait about a week before trying the food again. If you get a similar reaction two or three times in a row, you can probably assume she's sensitive to it. Eliminate that food from her diet for several months, then try it again if your pediatrician gives the green light. If your baby seems to react to almost every new food you offer, or there's a history of allergies in your family, wait a full week between trying any new item, and do check in with your doctor. HOW DO I PREVENT CHOKING? Here's what to do to prevent choking when solid food is on the menu: Stay close. At this point, eating should be a spectator sport, with you closely watching every bite your baby takes. Start small.  Cut food into pieces tiny enough that your baby can swallow them whole if she doesn't spend any time gumming them (enthusiastic eaters often gulp them down). Get bigger slowly.  As your baby gets used to eating pieces of soft, solid food (and as you get more comfortable watching her eat them successfully), gradually move upfrom minced to chopped to small cubes. Keep the portions baby-sized.  Place only one or two chunks at a time on the plate or tray so she doesn't stuff in more than she can handle. Stay seated.  Not you, but baby. Offer finger foods to your baby only when she's sitting down  not crawling, cruising or toddling around. Eating on the run isn't just bad manners; it's unsafe for the inexperienced eater. Stay safe.  Don't give your baby foods that won't dissolve in the mouth, can't be mashed with the gums or can be easily sucked into the windpipe. Avoid uncooked raisins, whole peas (unless they are smashed), raw, firm-fleshed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) or fruit (apples, unripe pears, grapes), large chunks of meat or poultry, and common choking hazards including popcorn, nuts, chunky nut butters and hot dogs. WHAT NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN INTRODUCING SOLIDS Alarming as it might seem, if your baby gags during her first encounter with any kind of food, her reaction is normal. When a baby gags, its a sign that she has either taken in too much food or pushed it too far back in her mouth. In either case, the gag reflex is what helps her get that food all the way out of harm's way (and, usually, all the way back out onto the bib or tray in the process). Make sure your baby is sitting upright in her chair, offer manageable servings and be sure to learn the difference between gagging and  choking . A child who is choking will look terrified, will not be making any sounds and will be unable to breathe; a baby who is experiencing a gag reflex will be coughing and making sounds. Also, if most of what you serve your baby ends up on the floor or otherwise uneaten, it's not a cause for concern, aside from any completely legit worries you might have about wasting food (and you can help conserve food and prevent waste by keeping serving sizes small). Your baby's first experiments with food are more about the ""experiment"" and less about the food  more about gaining experience than gaining sustenance, in other words. The bulk of your child's nutritional needs for the first year are still going to be met by breast milk or formula. Also, although it was once common to delay giving a baby certain foods like dairy, eggs, seafood and nuts in the hopes of staving off allergies,  the AAP no longer recommends doing so  since the data shows that holding off on certain foods does not prevent food allergies. In fact, in 2015, the AAP said that introducing allergenic foods like peanut butter earlier in a child's lifein the4- to 11-month rangeactually reduces her chances of developing a food allergy .Just be sure you've successfully introduced a couple of other solids (cereals, fruits or vegetables) first, and be sure to introduce the foods one at a time at home (not, say, at baby's day care center). Not so sure what's best for your baby? Check with her pediatrician. WHAT WILL MY BABY BE READY FOR NEXT? Those early-bird specials (rice cereal, applesauce, bananas, yellow veggies) get pretty old after a few dozen meals. Spice things up (at around 7 or 8 months) by adding minced meat (chicken, lamb, turkey or beef), mashed eggs and avocado to her repertoire. By 8 months (and possibly even sooner), whole-milk yogurt, cheese, pasta, beans and tofu can make their debuts, and then  finger foods  add a whole other dimension to eating. Ready to serve up a combo platter? That's fine, as long as you keep the foods separate for a while. Your goal is to get your baby acquainted (and happy) with the taste of particular foods, so if you mush the meats and veggies together, she may never know the joy of just plain peas. Once she likes the taste of a variety of different flavors, feel free to mix things up. Always hold off on honey (which can contain spores of  Clostridium botulinum,  a bacteria that is harmless to adults but can cause botulism, a serious illness, in babies) and cow's milk until your baby is at least 1 year old. Most doctors will, however, green-light whole-milk yogurt, cottage cheese and hard cheese by 8 months or so, or even sooner. If all this sounds complicated, take heart: In some ways, feeding a baby is easier than satisfying sophisticated older palates. Baby's first solid foods can be served cold, slightly warmed or at room temperature. And don't worry about adding salt, sugar or other spices  even the mildest pureed squash is an adventurous new taste and sensation for a little one just starting out."
6 Things I Should Be Ashamed About But I’m Not,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/things-i-should-be-ashamed-of,"Being a mom has changed me. I know everyone says that, but for me, it's really true. Growing up, my face would flush a deep red whenever I was embarrassed or ashamed. (So, like, all the time.) Since becoming a mom, however, I've found that very few things shame me. Could it be that being mom of three kids under 3 has made me completely immune to embarrassment? Who knows.

But if the nanny, my husband, or any other human with hands is around, I'm totally ""oblivious."" What poop? I don't smell a thing...until another adult enters the room and then, suddenly, I urgently need to leave. I know a good mom would instantly change her offspring instead of letting them stew in poop, but I seriously hate poop. Sorry, I'm not sorry. Driving out of my way to the drive-thru Starbucks just to have a little alone time.  As everyone knows, there's a Starbucks every two feet. You can run and be back with the kids in, like, five minutes. But the holy grail of suburban Starbucks is the drive-thru one that's 15 minutes away. Instead of running quickly to grab my chai, I use my long drive to clear my head, make mental lists, and just grab some precious alone time. Yes, it's selfish and I'm denying my children my charming company. But without even a modicum of alone time, I turn into crazy-short-tempered mom, and no one wants that. Using baby wipes instead of showering everyday . Before you saw ""Ew! Gross!"" consider this: If baby wipes are good enough to clean your baby, why not use them for a little refreshing on yourself? This is pure laziness on my part, but most mornings (and nights, for that matter) I'm so wiped from the kids, the world is just lucky I do anything to keep clean. Showering every day is just one more thing that exhausts me. Please, don't judge. Pretending I don't hear the kids at night . With three kids, there's usually one that wakes up during the night. A drink of water, a diaper change, or even just a hug, there's always something. But sometimes I just stick my head under a pillow and go back to snoozing. If trying to get a goodnight's sleep makes me bad, then I don't want to be good. Ordering a meal for each of my kids just so I can eat it.  My kids are little. They don't need full meals, especially restaurant-sized ones. But sometimes I order each one a kid's meal, and then proceed to eat the whole thing. On top of my own meal.

I'm Over Family Dinners,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/family-dinners-are-rough-in-our-house,"Mama, can you get me more water? Can I have some cheese? This is too hot. I don't like this. Can I have a bite of yours? I don't want anymore. Can I have one ice cube? These are just a sampling of some of the things I hear from my adorable almost-4-year-old daughter during dinner time. Throughout our meal, I'm up and down about five different times to tend to various dinner-related needs. And she's the easy one. My 16-month-old son has taken up activities such as throwing his food on the floor; taking the tray part of his high chair off and throwing  that  on the floor; demanding to be held; crying; among other things when we're trying to eat. MORE:  Toddler Dinner Ideas That Moms Love, Too Need I even say it? Dinner time is annoying. Before my husband and I had kids, we always ate dinner together. It was our time to hang out, unwind from work, and generally transition from the stresses of daytime to chilled-out nighttime. Lovely, right? After our daughter was born, we continued to eat dinner as a family, and while things were a bit messier, everything continued to be pretty pleasant and stress-free. But something has happened in the last few months: Both of my kids have turned into little wildlings during dinner, and, from preparation to ""eating"" to clean up, there's essentially nothing relaxing about it. Family dinners are important to my husband and me. We both grew up eating supper with our parents and siblings each night, and we're very aware of the value of this tradition. Dinner has always been the one guaranteed time of day to get together and reconnect with loved ones. I never understood how it worked in households where families  didn't  eat together. It's just what we've always done. That said, I'm starting to rethink this theory because dinners these days, to put it bluntly, just aren't fun. There seems to be a significantly higher amount of fetching various condiments than talking and reconnecting. My husband and I can barely get a word in edgewise between picking up thrown food, blowing on a certain toddler's chicken, and inevitably holding our son in one of our laps for the remainder of the meal. I very much want my children to understand the importance and value of family dinners, but with them both being so young, I'm not quite sure they're there yet. When I brought up the idea of eating dinner after our kids go to sleep as opposed to 5:30 (yes, we're cool) to my husband, it was met with a bit of resistance. And I get it. After the kids go to sleep, we clean up the house, walk the dog, catch up on work, watch 10 minutes of television before falling asleep on the couch, then shuffle up to bed. And that's at around 10 p.m. What the heck time would we get to bed if we ate dinner at 7:30? How would we get anything done? Like everything, it's posed its challenges. We haven't agreed to make the official switch yet, but we've started having dinner alone on weekends and -- surprise! -- it's  so  nice and filled with actual conversation. (Also, something we never took into consideration: Cleaning up is significantly faster when two adults are the ones who have eaten.) SEE ALSO:  Toddler Eating Habits: A Few Golden Rules As insane and unrelaxing as dinner with the kids is, it would break my heart a little to always eat without them. So for now, having an ""adult"" meal on weekends will have to do, while perhaps working our way up to a few weeknight meals without them. While we may not be having conversations about our days with our kids when we eat together (my daughter, like many toddlers, likes to save that until it's time to go to bed), we're together. And I'm hoping that somehow, some way, we're laying the foundation for something good. And relaxing. Relaxing would be nice.

Enjoying Family Meals With Toddlers,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/eating-basics/enjoying-family-meals-with-toddlers.aspx,"Having a toddler at the table can turn  family meal time  upside down  and we dont just mean that bowlof spaghetti your darling dumped on the floor. Yes, toddlers can be squirmy, messy, and moody, but the benefits of family meal time are huge. For one thing, research shows that kids eat more fruits and veggies when families dine together, and theyre less likely to become overweight as they grow. The perkspay off in the long run too: Teens who show up for family dinners are less likely to smoke or drink and more likely to have better grades and talk abou twhats bothering them. Sure, some of those benefits are a long way off, but you can start laying the foundation for successful family meal times now, even while your tots still tiny. Schedule it right.  Most toddlers hit the hay by 7 p.m., so family dinners have to be on the early side. This may be too early for working moms and dads, so try splitting the meal in to two parts. Your tot can dine with the parent whos home (even if he eats with just one of you,hell still reap the benefits of family meal time). Later, he can have a light snack or dessert with the second parent (or the two of you). Give him a job.  Two things toddlers love doing are helping out and copying you, so take advantage by assigning some simple  kitchen tasks.  Between the ages of one and two, your sous chef can cook alongside you: Get him a mini apron (or tie a towel at his waist), and set him up in a safe spot with a wooden spoon and a pot. When hes two, he can tear lettuce for a salad, stir ingredients in a bowl (with a little help), fold napkins (well, sort of), and bring spoons to the table to help set it. Offer him (healthy) choices.  At this age, your tot likes to have a say in everything, including what goes down his adorable little hatch. So offer three to four  healthy options , including atleast two familiar faves  pasta and cheese, baby carrots and dip  and let him choose what (and how much) he wants to eat. To give his appetite a fighting chance at family meal time, limit late-afternoon snacking. Make it fun.  If the meal is entertaining, your little one may linger a bit longer (but skip TV, Mom, because its way too distracting). Sing silly songs, give him a colorful straw for his milk, or try one of these special supper treats: Have a picnic on the family-room floor, serve breakfast for dinner, or set up a baked-potato bar and let your tot pick his toppings. Sethim free.  Theres no such thing as the dinner  hour  when you've got a toddler at the table. In fact, ten minutes is probably the maximum amount of time your wiggle worm can sit without fidgeting. Instead of forcing him to stay put while you finish, let him play on the floor nearby. If he sees that the meal goes on without him, he may decide to rejoin you for a few more bites."
Quick Family Meals - Homemade Cheesy Rice,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/expectingtheunexpectedablogonmyjourneythroughpregn/quick-family-meals-homemade-cheesy-rice,"Yesterday, some leftover white rice in the fridge led me to come up with a new addition to my quick family meals repertoire. I thought to myself, ""How can I make this interesting, and appealing to Aden?"" I decided to try making a quick macaroni and cheese type of meal using the rice. Since I've made macaroni and cheese before, I know that you need milk, cheese (obviously), flour, ground mustard, and just a pinch of paprika. Usually macaroni and cheese involves an egg to help it hold, but with quick family meals, you don't want to end up baking! So I combined those ingredients with the rice to make...voila!...cheesy rice! Sometimes we have a tough time finding vegetarian family meals that Aden finds appetizing. For instance, he won't touch Swiss chard, but he loves to nibble the ends off of roasted asparagus. He'll gobble down pasta, but he hates potatoes, whether they're mashed, roasted, or baked (he does love French fries though, but what kid doesn't?)

But the cheesy rice was such a hit that I wanted to share it on my blog so parents of fellow picky toddlers could try it out.

Nursing Mom in Jail Fights for Right To Pump Milk For Her Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/nursing-mom-in-jail-fights-for-right-to-pump-milk-for-her-baby,"Christina Milliner, mother to newborn Micah, was ordered to spend two weekends in a Michigan jail, and when she showed up to serve her time, officials told her she couldn't bring her breast pump which, it turns out, could be pretty illegal. Milliner was initially charged with retail fraud and then after failing to appear for multiple court-mandated meetings because of issues finding childcare, she says, she was given her sentence. The nuances of her case aside, Milliner and her baby, who was born prematurely, are still nursing. Breast milk is even more crucial for premature babies, yet the jail stood its ground in not letting her pump or nurse. At least at first. ""As a result, I was in constant, excruciating pain,"" Milliner said in a statement. ""But worse than my pain was my fear that, by the time I was released, my milk would dry up and I would no longer be able to breastfeed my newborn, Micah. My baby was so tiny when he was born, and Micah's doctors had kept telling me how important it was that I breastfeed him. No mother should have to go through this  and certainly no child should either.""     Advanced Skin Cancer Med   Learn About an Advanced   Skin Cancer Treatment Option Here.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Fortunately, Milliner was able to file a complaint through the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which contacted the jail and county sheriff's department on her behalf. ACLU argued that because incarcerated people have a constitutional right to medical care and jails have an obligation to meet inmates' needs, officials were violating Milliner's civil rights. They immediately reversed their decision to deny her the right to pump and also vowed to create a policy that permits all nursing inmates to bring their own breast pumps. Regardless of what you think of Milliner, her mothering, or her crime, one fact about this case is clear: a breastfeeding mother has no control over whether her body will produce milk. Her milk ducts dont care if she is in jail, on top of Mt. Everest, or competing in the Olympics. They will just keep on doing their thing and making meal. To prevent a mother from pumping is not only foolish (because a mom needs to express milk, just like how she needs to pee and sweat), but its also harmful to both the mother and the child. A baby, especially a preemie, needs those nutrients, and if he hasnt ever had formula, introducing formula literally overnight risks dehydrating him if he refuses it. And without a pump, that poor mother could end up with mastitis, an incredibly painful breast infection, an abscess, and her supply could be diminished for the future as well. Not to mention, babies of incarcerated women are already suffering. Why make them suffer more by taking away a healthy meal?"

What It's Like to Go Out to Dinner as a New Mom,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/going-out-to-dinner-as-a-new-mom,"When  Chrissy Teigen had the audacity to go out to dinner  a week after giving birth to her daughter, Luna Simone Stephens, the Internet, as its wont to do, lost its collective stuff. After Teigen and her husband, John Legend, were spotted at a restaurant in Los Angeles  without their 1-week-old  some people felt the need to tweet and Instagram nasty things to the model, letting her know that no good mother would ever  dare  go out to dinner so soon after giving birth. The nerve! SEE ALSO:  Lets Leave Chrissy Teigen and Her Newborn Alone What these mamas clearly didnt see, though, was the inside of Teigens head when she was out for the first time without her baby.

Here are seven thoughts and feelings all new moms have the first time they leave their kids for a date night. 1.  [The first 10 minutes.]  You sit down. You think, Ahhh, this is nice. Let me put my  clutch  bag  not my 10,000-pound diaper bag  on the table. You feel relaxed (albeit like a piece of you is missing) and ready to reconnect with your partner. Hey look, its your partner! When was the last time you two chatted without a baby in one of your arms? Fun times! 2.  [Twenty minutes in.]  You start wondering. Thinking. Fantasizing about whats going on at your house. Is your baby sleeping? If so, does that mean she doesnt miss you? Is she crying? If so, would the sitter text you? Should you text the sitter just to check? You think better of it. Youre here to spend time with your partner. Besides, if something was really wrong, someone would let you know right? 3.  [Thirty minutes in.]  Youre a little loose from the glass of wine you had (why does wine taste so much better now?), and youre feeling like your old self. You and your partner are even having a conversation that doesnt revolve around kids. Look at you! Who said women cant have it all?! Youre awesome! Moms are awesome! Life is awesome! 4.  [Forty minutes in.]  Youve eaten your first uninterrupted meal in who knows how long and it was great. But now youre missing your baby. You and your partner start going through photos of her on your phone. Ooh, and theres the video of her making all those funny noises in the bath! Watch that! 5.  [Fifty minutes in.]  OK, where the hell is the check? This is getting ridiculous. Is the waiter  trying  to mess with your emotions? Is your partner seriously considering dessert?! You may as well have gone on vacation at this point! 6.  [One hour in.]  You text the sitter, who, lets be honest, has been weirdly quiet, to see if everything is OK. It is. You feel better, but wonder about her definition of OK. Would it be uncomfy if you asked her to elaborate. MORE:  9 Things Your Babysitter Needs to Know 7.  [One hour and a few minutes after your dinner began.]  Youve got the check and youre good to go. You feel happy and fulfilled that you and your partner got to spend some quality time together. But lets be real here: Youre not doing that again any time soon. You miss your baby.

But you can make your own or use whatever kind you like. Ground turkey, I do think beef or chicken would be fine, but ground beef is not as lean as ground turkey so not only does ground turkey work better for healthy family dinners but it also does not cause a grease overload in your muffin cup. Salsa. Cheese. I used Mexican blend shredded cheese. Sour cream. Taco seasoning. Onion. Shredded carrots. For this easy healthy meal I first poured the cornbread mix in the muffin tins, I filled it only about the size of an eraser tip on a pencil, remember it will rise. I then made the Mexican meatloaf with the turkey and a taco seasoning mix. I added in onion and shredded carrots. I saw recently on  Heidi Murkoffs Facebook  page that she always added in shredded carrots to her kids food. I decided to give it a try and no one even noticed! Great advice! I then formed the meat into patties, make them big enough to reach just below the muffin tin tops. Allow to bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes. When they are finished just split the biggest one to see if they are cooked through. Then add the cheese and put the muffin tin back into the oven to melt for a couple of minutes. Remove the cornbread mini loafs and add the salsa And the sour creamAnd enjoy! I am a proud mom of this meal, the kids loved it! Alan loved it so much he kept telling Josh ""Good!"" during dinner.

"MOM CRUSH: Susan in Lancaster, PA",http://www.whattoexpect.com/family/mom-crush/profile/susan-lancaster-pa,"Every week, we share our newest Mom Crush , giving you a glimpse into the life of a mom  from her biggest challenges and successes to her best advice for other parents. Name:  Susan B. Age:  31 Hometown:  Lancaster, Pennsylvania Occupation:  Currently a SAHM and creator of sweetaddieb.com Mom to:  Adeline (""Addie""), 23 months and pregnant with a baby boy What surprised you most about motherhood? I wasn't expecting how much it would literally change my life: Since I had Addie,  I quit my dream job  and moved to the burbs. If you had told me that any one of these things would have happened two years ago, I probably would have told you that you were crazy! Another thing: Before becoming a mom, I had so many opinions on what was right and what was wrong. That all went straight out the window when our daughter arrived. How does your family handle budgeting? Now that I'm a SAHM, we pay more attention to money. There are fixed costs like our mortgage that is what it is. For more variable costs, like food and entertainment, we try to stick to a budget, but for us, it's more important to make sure we're eating nutritious meals then to be totally cost-effective. How did that budget shift after having a baby? We cut back on eating out and entertainment, which really helped outand also happens pretty naturally since so much of your time is spent caring for your little one. Your best money-saving trick? I highly recommend making and freezing easy-to-reheat and pre-portioned meals before baby arrives. Freezer meals helped us save a lot of money and were also just convenient to have with a newborn. We lived in New York City when my daughter was born, and I think we would have spent all of our money on food delivery if we hadn't planned ahead. Any other tricks that work particularly well? There is one rule of thumb that my husband and I implemented early in our marriage: We alert the other spouse if we're planning to spend more than $200 on a single item. It's not so much to ask permission, but more to make sure that the other person is aware so we can still stay within our budget. This also helps prevent impulse buys. What baby item proved especially useful? We found it so helpful to have a safe place to set baby down. We had the Fisher Price Snugapuppy and also a Mamaroo. Our daughter loved both, but the less expensive Snugapuppy got more use, since we could carry it from room to room. (For example, I could bring it into the bathroom so I could take a shower!) Is there anything you bought but never touched? A bottle sterilizer. Truth be told, I think we used it once but quickly realized it was much easier to sterilize the old-fashioned way with a large pot and boiling water. Youre expecting again (congrats!). Anything youre doing differently this time around? I'm trying not to focus so much on how the baby gets here. With my first I was so wrapped up in my birth plan and having a natural birth... and then that didn't happen (I had a c-section after 27 hours of labor), and I was disappointed. It's important to be educated, but its also important to realize that things may not go according to plan. This time, Im trying to roll with it. And how about once youre home from the hospital? Just love that baby. Don't worry about having your house look perfect or about looking perfect for guests. Take a shower, for your own sanity and hygiene, but who cares if you're in sweats all the time?!And dont stress about thank-you cards or birth announcements. They will get done. Oh, and try to take naps. Naps are the best. Got a  mom crush ?To nominate someone you think we should feature, email whattoexpecteditor@gmail.com."

8 Ways I'm Saving on Groceries in the New Year,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/family/8-ways-i-m-saving-on-groceries-in-the-new-year.aspx,"Did you start 2016 off with grand plans to tighten your budget? Specifically in the groceries category? I did! Whether you're saving for a summer vacation (like me!), working towards becoming debt free, or just generally aiming to be wiser with your income and expenses, I think every parent can agree that grocery shopping can often make or break the monthly budget. With end caps full of the latest and greatest crackers/cereal/snacks our children must have and wine bottles calling our names oh so sweetly, is it really possible to visit the grocery store and simultaneously save money? MORE:  How to Make -- and Keep! -- a Family Budget     Major Depressive Disorder   Learn About an Add-On Prescription   Treatment For Adults w/ Depression   www.information-about-mdd.com       I'm hesitant to say yes, because, well, food is a necessary expense. Maybe it's not the best line item for me to think about scrimping on. And I'm guessing, like you, there just isn't time to clips coupons that will save a meager 25 cents. Don't get me wrong. I  do  want to save. And I think it  could  be possible to do this at the grocery store, but sometimes my fancy coconut water and hidden stash of chocolates is the only thing that gets me through the day. So, where to begin? Well, since I found myself oscillating between depriving my middle child of his beloved Dino nuggets and forgoing the better smelling laundry detergent, I decided to ask my mama tribe how they save on groceries. They came through, as they always do. These tips and tricks are pretty much brilliant and I can't wait to put them in action. Vacation --- here I come! Weekly menu planning . The resounding consensus was that to save at the grocery store, you have to plan ahead. Go in, armed with a list. Explain said list to your kids and DO NOT WAIVER. Go without . Feel a hankering for pears, but only have apples at home. Eat an apple. Want lasagna, but have frozen tortellini. Tortellini it is. Home ain't a restaurant, so go with the flow and cancel those last minute grocery store runs for unnecessary items. Forget coupons; download apps . Coupons have their place. Of course, use them when you can for items you need. But, it's 2016! Download the app for your favorite store, and learn to save with that! Target's Cartwheel App is brilliant, as is Safeway's and Fred Meyer/Kroger's. The art of buying in bulk . Be mindful of what you use larger quantities of and capitalize on the savings that bulk can bring. Personally, I use Zaycon for chicken and bacon and love the savings that brings. Costco and Sam's Club are wonderful options for specific items, and a friend recently shared with me that Azure Standard is great for bulk health items. Amazon!  You know what is great? Having a shopping list, sitting at my computer, waiting two days (thank you, Prime!), and then gathering my order from my front porch. There are no temptations, and no kids to wrangle. I honestly don't know why I didn't start ordering some of my groceries online years ago! Freezer meals . I think this is super smart, not only to save money but time as well! When you prep a meal, fix a double batch, but go ahead and skimp a little on the more expensive ingredients. For example, if the recipe calls for 2 pounds of chicken, use 1 and a half pounds instead and add in extra veggies or whatever. Then, with two meals worth of food, divide it up, and freeze half. For one round of work, you'll have a meal ready for dinner and another in the freezer for another night! This especially works with meals like enchiladas where you can use a little less meat and cheese (expensive ingredients) and add more beans and veggies (less expensive ingredients). Shop around . All the mamas rave about Grocery Outlet and other discount grocery stores. Apparently, these places get tons of organic and specialty options that normally cost and arm and a leg at the more mainstream stores. So, as one smart mama recommends, go to Grocery Outlet with your shopping list FIRST, get what you can for a deal, and then fill in what you still need from the regular store. It means two stops, but it also means big savings. READ:   The Biggest Change in My Budget Now That I Have Kids Be wise . Sometimes saving at the grocery store is more about your mindset than anything else. Don't go when you feel hungry, set fair expectations for your kids if they're tagging along, and simply ask, ""Do I really need this?"" before adding anything to your cart. Now it's your turn!

Formula-Feeding Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/bottle-feeding/formula-feeding-baby/,"There's not a lot of mystery behind  feeding baby a bottle   for either you or your baby  since newborns can typically figure out how to use one pretty easily. But while breast milk is always on tap and ready to serve, formula must be chosen, bought, sometimes prepared and often stored  which means you'll need a lot of know-how before you mix up that first baby bottle. Whether you're formula-feeding exclusively or just supplementing, here's what you'll need to know to get started. Tips on Formula-Feeding Your Baby Here are some good-to-know tips for getting formula-feeding off to a good start: Snuggle up.  The most important ingredient in any feeding session  breast or bottle  is love. The kind of skin-to-skin, eye-to-eye contact that's linked to optimum brain development and attachment in a newborn can be easily added to bottle-feeding.  Nestle your baby close to you, take your time and extend the feeding session by chatting, singing or cooing to your baby once the bottle is drained. Need more ideas? These  tips for bonding with your baby while bottle-feeding  should help. Serve the bottle cold or at room temperature right from the start. It may come as a surprise, but there are no health benefits to heating up a bottle before a baby chows down. Its simply a matter of taste  some babies prefer their formula warm, while others like it cold or at room temperature. What that boils down to is this time-saving tip: Getting your baby accustomed to unheated formula early on will save you a lot of effort in the long run. If your baby ends up preferring bottles warm, use a bowl or pot of hot (not boiling) water or use a specially designed bottle warmer.  Never heat formula in a microwave oven  the liquid may warm unevenly, or the container may remain cool while the formula has gotten hot enough to burn baby's mouth or throat. Don't worry about dark, smelly poop.  Compare whats in the diaper of a breastfed baby with what's in that of a formula-fed baby and youll likely see some differences. In general, the stool of a formula-fed baby smells stronger, is darker in color and is firmer than that of a breastfed baby. But  baby poop  varies from infant to infant. Different smells and colors are nothing to worry about. Get the whole family involved . Dad, Grandma or an older sibling can share in the pleasures of feeding a baby when that baby is bottle-fed. Take full advantage by encouraging your loved ones to think of mealtime as cuddle time. By holding that little bundle close, gazing into his eyes, stroking his cheeks and singing him a lullaby, theyll be giving him a large dose of love as well as nutrition. Signs Baby's Hungry Ideally, you should feed your baby at the first signs of hunger. Don't wait for tears; by then, your little one may be uncomfortably hungry, especially the longer he cries. He might be tiny, but he'll make his needs known by: Nuzzling against your breasts Sucking furiously on his hands (or your shirt, or your arm) Opening his mouth Rooting reflex (baby turns his head to the side with his mouth open to find the food source, often after his cheek is stroked) Sucking on his lip or tongue (which can look like he's sticking his tongue out) Making lip-smacking sounds If he does cry, it will typically be a short, low-pitched wail that rises and falls What Are the Different Types of Formula? You're bound to be a bit overwhelmed by the head-spinning selection of brands, varieties and prices you'll find in the formula section of the store or online. Where to begin? First, know that whichever kind you end up choosing for your little one's tiny tummy will provide your baby with quality nutrition. In fact, there are plenty of nutritionally sound options that come close to replicating nature's perfect recipe. So while no formula is packed with the immune molecules passed in breast milk from mother to baby, many have the same types and proportions of proteins, fats, carbohydrates,  vitamins  and minerals as breast milk. For example, most formula for infants now contains DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, respectively, that have been shown to enhance mental and visual development in infants and play an important role in brain function. Here's a look at the most common types of infant formula to choose from: Milk-based, iron-fortified formula.  Cow's milk is a definite no-no for babies younger than 12 months because it's hard to digest and doesn't provide the complete nutrition developing infants need. But most formulas for bottle-feeding are made with cow's milk that's been modified for human babies. Proteins are altered to be easily digestible, milk sugar (or lactose) is added to more closely resemble breast milk, and vegetable oil is substituted for butterfat. Because iron is so essential for infant growth and development, both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the majority ofpediatricians recommend iron-fortified formula for most babies until at least their first birthday. Hydrolyzed formula.  The protein content in this type of formula is broken down into smaller proteins, making it easier for baby to digest (which is why its also known as predigested formula). Theres a lot to consider about switching to hydrolyzed or even partially hydrolyzed formula (for one, its often more pricey), so be sure to talk to your pediatrician about options for bottle-feeding an allergy-prone baby before you make this choice. Soy-based formula.  Originally popularized by dairy-averse vegans, soy-based formulas are made from soybeans supplemented with vitamins, minerals and nutrients. But because soy formulas differ more from human milk than cow's milk, they aren't usually recommended as a drink-of-choice except under certain circumstances (e.g. a cow's  milk allergy , though keep in mind it's common for infants with a milk allergy to also be sensitive to soy protein). The AAP maintains that soy-based formula should only be used in a handful of situations, like in the rare instance that a baby is intolerant to galactose. Special formula.  Some bottle-feeding babies require special formulations, including premature infants, babies allergic to both cow's milk and soy formulas, and babies with metabolic disorders such as PKU. These infant formula products, which aren't necessary or recommended unless your pediatrician says so, are often hypoallergenic, lactose-free or especially easy to digest (and come with a particularly steep price tag). Organic formula.  These come from milk products that are produced without the use of pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics or growth hormones, and for that reason are considered healthier by some doctors. However, certain organic infant formulas are sweetened with cane sugar (sucrose), which is significantly sweeter than the sugars commonly used in formula and which, some experts worry, could contribute to problems like tooth decay and excess weight gain. Not all organic formulas use sucrose, however, so check the labels and if you still have questions, ask your pediatrician. Probiotic and prebiotic formula.  Some formulas for babies are now fortified with probiotics, a bacteria that's supposed to prevent diarrhea in otherwise healthy children. Probiotics should not be given to chronic or seriously ill babies, and according to the AAP, the jury is still out on whether or not they're effective in  treating  diarrhea or preventing any other conditions. Prebiotics are also added to some formulas in order to reduce infections in healthy children, but it's still uncertain whether or not they're effective, either. Follow-up formula.  These formulas are geared toward bottle-feeding babies older than 4 months who are also eating  solid foods . They're not a good choice for a younger baby, though. You should always ask your doctor before introducing them to the menu. What's the Best Formula for My Baby? The vast selection of formulas on store shelves can be dizzying  and more than a little confusing. Here are some smart tips to help you find the right one for your baby: Check with the pediatrician.  Your baby's doctor can help you narrow the formula field, so ask for a recommendation first. Every baby is different, and while the majority of newborns do best on standard cow's milk-based formula, a small percentage may need something special (because of low birth weight or an allergy or intolerance, for instance). Steer clear of low-iron formulas.  The AAP and mostpediatricians recommend that babies be given iron-fortified formula from birth until 1 year to prevent anemia. Don't assume that special formulas are better formulas.  If you're considering trying a specialty formula (say, one that's soy-based), always ask the doctor before you stock up. Specialty formulas tend to be much more expensive than standard formula and aren't always necessary. Be wary of switching formulas too quickly.  It may be tempting to try a new type of formula the minute your munchkin spits up. But spitting up doesnt necessarily signal a problem with what a babys eating (spit-up happens). Most pediatricians recommend staying with a formula for at least one week instead of switching too frequently, which can cause digestive issues for baby. Theres no getting around it: Formula can be expensive. You can expect to shell out an average of $1,400 on it before your babys first birthday. Prices vary depending on the type of formula you use (powder, concentrate or ready-to-feed), and specialized formulas can be up to 20 percent more expensive than the standard, iron-fortified, cows-milk variety. The least expensive option is powdered formula that you mix yourself. Moving up the cost scale is liquid concentrate (just add water), and finally  at the top of the formula pyramid  ready-to-feed formula. Looking for a way to keep cost down but not ready to fully give up on convenience? One approach is to splurge for the convenience of ready-to-feed formula during your babys first few weeks when sleep is hard to come by  and the last thing you want to do is measure and mix at 2 a.m. Once your little one is sleeping more and your feeding routine is well-established, you may feel more up to the task of making bottles. If you're heading out for the day (or for a few), be sure to prep enough bottles to leave with your infant's caregiver and explain how to best give them to her. Another way to save on formula? Try registering on the manufacturers web site for coupons and/or rebate checks. Buying generic formula will also save you some bucks. How Much Formula Should I Give My Baby? Start your newborn out slowly. For the first week or so, your baby will probably take about 1 or 2 ounces at each feeding (every 3 to 4 hours or on demand). Gradually up the ounces, adding more as the demand becomes greater, but never push baby to take more than he wants. The same rules apply if you're combining formula with breast milk or using bottles to serve up milk you've pumped: Give your baby only as much as he's hungry for without forcing him to finish if he doesn't want to. A very general rule of thumb is to take your baby's weight and multiply it by 2.5  that's the total number of ounces to feed your baby over the course of a 24-hour period. So if your baby weighs 10 pounds, he should be drinking roughly 20 to 25 ounces per day  or about three to four ounces every four hours. Need more guidance? Check in with your pediatrician about how much to give your baby and use this guide about  how much formula to feed as your baby grows . Is Formula Ever Bad or Unsafe for My Baby? Baby formula is safer and easier to use than ever. But you still have to be careful when buying, preparing and storing it. Follow these tips to make sure formula is as safe as possible for your baby.  Always check the expiration date . If its expired, dont buy or use it. Same goes for cans or containers that are dented, leaky, rusty or otherwise damaged (even a pin-size hole can let in harmful bacteria). Mix it right.  Check the directions to see whether the formula needs to be mixed with water and if it does, follow the measurements precisely. Formula thats underdiluted can lead to problems, including dehydration, while overdiluted formula can interfere with a baby's growth and proper nutrition. Always toss leftovers.  Bacteria from a babys saliva can multiply in the bottle, so always toss any leftover formula. If youre worried about waste, offer up smaller servings and give him a refill if hes hungry for more. Keep prepared bottles of formula refrigerated until ready to use . If you're traveling away from home, store previously prepared bottles in an insulated container or a tightly sealed plastic bag with a small ice pack or a dozen ice cubes (the formula will stay fresh as long as most of the ice is frozen). Don't use pre-mixed formula that's no longer cold to the touch (it'll have to be tossed). Throw unused refrigerated formula away according to the instructions on the label.  Refrigerated formula that's been opened or poured into bottles needs to be tossed after a certain amount of time, depending on what kind it is. Check the label and throw out anything you don't use in the amount of time specified. Still have some concerns about safe formula-feeding? Follow these  simple tips about formula safety. Weaning From Breast to Bottle Ready to offer that first bottle to your breastfed baby? Your little one may have no trouble switching over and take a bottle easily right from the start, or he could need a bit longer to get used to this new way of eating. Keeping these  weaning tips  in mind will help transition your baby from the breast to the bottle without too many bumps. Easing into it gradually winds up working better for some babies. If your schedule will require you to miss two feedings during the day, for instance, switch to the bottle one feeding at a time, starting two weeks before you plan to go back to work or school. Give your baby a full week to get used to the single bottle-feeding before moving on to two. This will help your baby and your breasts adjust over time if you'll be supplementing with formula instead of pumping and feeding breast milk. No matter what, take heart in knowing that you'll find a formula your baby likes, learn the prep and storage ropes in no time, and settle into a good feeding routine so that it all becomes second nature before you know it."

And moms who opt to  formula feed  don't deserve to be shamed for it, either. Unfortunately, though, it's a common parenting woe to receive unsolicited advice from people who are in no positing to give it.

Muscato and her husband prepared for  breastfeeding  by taking a four-hour class and she was thrilled when her baby started feeding just an hour after delivery.

None of it worked, so ""we tried the hypoallergenic dairy protein free formula you saw me buying today. And the screaming lessened. And my baby started smiling. She started interacting. She started sleeping."" ""And I cried. Because I thought breast was best. I thought my body failed her. I thought she wouldn't be as healthy on formula,"" she continued. ""I know you think I must not care or I'm lazy, or maybe you were genuinely trying to be helpful and thought no one had ever told me the benefits of breast feeding. But, you are wrong."" Every mom has story after story of receiving ""helpful"" parenting tips from others. Some of these tips come from a good place; others, not so much. The fact is that we're all just trying to figure things out when it comes to this whole parenting thing, so ""helpful"" comments can sometimes be the opposite. What's best for your baby might not be what's best for your coworker's, your friend's or a stranger's. ""What I know that you don't is that breast ISN'T always best,"" Muscato concluded. ""I know happy, healthy baby is best. I know FED is best.""

"Breastfeeding Education Works Better than Banning Formula in Hospitals, Report Says",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/breastfeeding-education-works-better-than-banning-formula-in-hospitals-report-says/,"The strategy that most effectively leads moms to stick with  breastfeeding  for the recommended one year does not involve hospital-wide bans on formula or pacifiers but rather addresses the invidivual needs of moms through education and support,  a new report  from theU.S. Preventive Services Task (USPSTF) Force finds. USPSTF is a government-supported group that specializes in medical-data analysis and makes recommendations about preventative medical practices.  Its last breastfeeding recommendations  before this week came out in 2008.This time around, USPSTF compared systemic breastfeeding interventions, basically hospital rules designed to encourage breastfeeding, and individual interventions, giving moms one-on-one help, by reviewing 52 studies involving more than 66,000 moms. Report authors concluded, ""Breastfeeding support interventions are associated with an increase in the rates of any and exclusive breastfeeding.""While there's no evidence that a certain type of education is better than another, ""prenatal education, support at or around the time of delivery, and postpartum support"" worked best when a mom got all three.             Psoriasis Treatment    Explore a Treatment Option for Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis   www.informationaboutpsoriasis.com         That lactation support before, during and after childbirth helps moms long-term isn't exactly groundbreaking; other studies have found similar results, one in particular attesting that  nurses are the secret ingredient to breastfeeding success . What's most interesting, though, is that there isn't much evidence supporting hospital-wide pro-breastfeeding guidelines. Since 2006, when the World Health Organization launched its "" baby-friendly hospital "" guidelines, more birthing facilities have implemented systemic interventions designed to encourage long-term breastfeeding, including bans on artificial nipples, discouring formula use, and requiring moms and babies to room in together, in addition to extra breastfeeding help. Critics of the initiative have said it  ultimately removes choices for moms , who should be able to decide for themselves how to feed their infants. And now more experts are coming out saying these restrictions might have no effect and in rare cases could be harmful. An editorial which accompanied USPSTF's study  in the  Journal ofthe American Mediacal Association wrote that the 9 studies touching on ""systemic interventions"" that the USPSTF looked provided ""no consistent association"" with ""beneficial outcomes,"" and also explained that practices around restricting pacifier and formula use could be problematic for infant health. For one, evidence shows that pacifiers can lower risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the most common cause of death in babies less than 1. In addition, babies whose moms have low milk production may be subject to dehydration and other conditions if they're only allowed to drink breast milk. While the USPSTF and the editorial authors are calling for more research on systemic interventions (nine studies isn't actually a lot), for now one thing is clear: the best approach to helping nursing moms is to provide abundant education and support and to respond to each mom's individual breastfeeding needs."

Unsurprising Study Finds Moms Feel Guilty No Matter How They Choose to Feed Their Babies,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/study-finds-moms-feel-guilty-for-formula-feeding-and-breastfeeding,"For what seems like the first time ever, a study is backing up the fact that mom guilt is very, very real. Especially when it comes to feeding, and if you choose formula. Or breastfeeding. Or to supplement. Or pretty much anything. The  study , published in  Journal of Maternal and Child Nutrition , looked at over 1,600 mothers with babies up to 26 weeks old and compared how they planned to feed their babies while they were pregnant to how they actually ended up feeding their babies -- and how those differences impacted them emotionally. The results were not that surprising, but are still telling: Moms who planned to breastfeed but did not felt the most guilt. Mothers who planned on exclusively breastfeeding or started out exclusively breastfeeding, but then stopped felt the worst. Formula-feeding moms felt the need to justify their choice. Overall, the majority of formula-feeding mothers felt guilty and stigmatized. Moms who breastfed but supplemented with formula also struggled with guilt. Mothers who breastfed exclusively reported lower levels of guilt than formula-feeding mothers, but they still had guilt over returning to work, nursing in public, and what family members would think of their nursing choices. (You know, like those snide  comments that just about every breastfeeding mom definitely does not want to hear .) When it comes to feeding our babies, it can feel like there is no good solution. Breastfeeding might be the medically-preferred option, but not the option that your body or baby prefers. And even if you are able to nurse, there are trade-offs, like time, sleep and, you know, having another human depend on your boobs to live. No pressure! Formula moms may feel judged, worry if its the best choice or wish they could be breastfeeding. Feeding our babies is one of the very first acts of mothering that we do, so it feels like one we cant mess up. And because there is no such thing as a perfect solution, its inevitable we all feel at least a little guilty. I had mastitis almost the entire time I breastfed my two youngest children, which meant my babies were getting non-stop antibiotics through my milk for months. I wondered if it harmed them, and because breastfeeding took me away from my older kids, I felt bad about that, too. So moms of the world, how do we move past our guilt? Well, a massive societal shift toward respecting moms' choices, encouraging science-based practices but not condemning moms when it's not for them, and eliminating all the catch-22s for parents would be nice. But that could take a while. So for now, whether we're choosing how to work, discipline or get baby to sleep, let's just lose the guilt. It won't wont take us back in time so we can make a different choice. It won't change our circumstances, and it sure as heck wont benefit our kids. Loving yourself and trusting your instincts will. And just a reminder, Mama, because you definitely don't hear it enough, you're doing great."
"Know the Difference Between ""Natural"" and ""Organic""",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0502/you-should-know-the-difference-between-natural-and-organic,"When you're opting for  formula feeding  instead of breast milk, knowing exactly what's in it can help you give baby the healthiest start in life. That's why the  lawsuit against the Honest Company baby product and home goods manufacturer started by mom of two Jessica Alba  for usingsynthetic ingredients despite ""organic"" labeling in its Premium Infant Formula is so concerning. To be fair, the allegations are just that: allegations made by the Organic Consumers Association that have not been corroborated.  The document  states the formula contains 11 synthetic ingredients that are not allowed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to be in products labeled ""organic."" It's unclear where they got this number. Honest Co. reps responded  with a blog post  that outlines four ways they say their formula actually does meet USDA requirements and added that Alba's co-founder Christopher Gavigan developed the formula for his own son. According to the post, the product has been cleared by  the USDA's National Organic Program (hence the label), is at least 95 percent organic ingredients, and is manufactured in line with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for infant formula.     Advanced Skin Cancer Med   Get the Facts on Advanced Melanoma   & a Treatment Option that May Help.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       The suit is still underway, and the ingredients of the formula still need to be analyzed. Until those results come back, you should understand why foods and other household products are labeled ""organic"" versus ""natural"" to decide how to best care for your family. What does a ""natural"" label mean? ""Natural"" products are not tested by the USDA or the FDA, nor are they regulated to the same degree as those that are ""organic."" It's a designation that primarily refers to the final product's contents as opposed to the way it was made. For example, a food that's minimally processed might still contain synthetic ingredients, says Jennifer Lowry, MD, chief of toxicology at Children's Mercy hospital in Kansas City. Moreover, to label a product ""natural,"" companies must only have one justification for why it's ""natural."" So if a product is free of artificial sweeteners but contains fruits grown with pesticides, it can still be labeled ""natural."" Bottom line: The label of ""natural"" is used ""willy nilly,"" Lowry says. What does an ""organic"" label mean? An USDA Certified Organic label addresses both the final product and the way each ingredient in the final product was made. It must check every individual criterion that can make a product ""natural,"" in additon to using only ingredients farmed according to ""organic"" regulations. For example, organic farmers cannot use genetic engineering or synthetic fertilizers, and they cannot expose their produce to radiation. What should you look for in infant formula? A cow's milk base.  These formulas are the most similar in composition to breast milk. If you're concerned about allergies or raising a vegan baby, ask your doc about alternatives. Organic label. If you can afford it, these products are recommended because they don't use milk from animals exposed to growth hormones, antibiotics or pesticides. Nothing ""special"" or ""low-iron.""  Special formulas are usually overpriced and make false promises (""No more gas!"") with ingredients your baby probaly doesn't need. And iron-fortified is probably preferred for your growing tot. If your baby has special nutritional needs, ask your doc which formulas and additives will best meet these. Whatever your doc recommends.  Always, always ask your doctor which formula to buy before trying one. He or she can tell you which products are best suited to your baby's unique needs. ""Natural"" and ""organic"" are overwhelming buzz words, especially for stressed-out parents trying to choose between a million different product and food options for their babies. But Lowry says there's one extra important thing to know about these labels: Focus on giving your child all the right nutrients  first  and what qualifies ""organic"" or ""natural"" second. If you can't afford organic or natural, do your best to hit all the necessary food groups any way you can, even if that means canned, frozen or with pesticides. The benefits of that non-organic strawberry far outweigh the possible risks behind how it was grown. 3 Things to Read Next: 8 Things You Need to Know About Using Honest Suncreen on Babies The Simple Way Jessica Alba Copes with Mom Guilt What You Need to Know About Arsenic in Baby's Rice Cereal"

Slowing Down a Spitter,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ask-heidi/month-4/slowing-down-a-spitter.aspx,"I, too, had a prodigious spitter (I remember that telltale aroma like it was yesterday!).But something you might want to keep in mind  babies seem to spit up more than they really do, at least in terms of quantity, if not frequency. Though it often looks as though they've lost their lunch, literally, it's typically just a few sips, mixed up with saliva and mucus (ick!)  so it looks like a lot more. If your baby's growing well, peeing and pooping plenty, and thriving, there's no need to worry. Most babies stop spitting up so much when they start spending more time consistently in an upright position (lying down or reclining after a meal or being jostled a lot can bring up the works), and that usually happens around six months. The introduction of solids will also make a difference (a liquid diet is easier to spit), but don't start until she's developmentally ready and do check with your doctor first (most doctors recommend starting solids between four and six months). Meanwhile, keep your baby upright as much as possible after meals, and always check with your doctor when you switch formulas (if you haven't already). Also call your pediatrician if you have any other reason to be concerned about your baby's spitting (when in doubt, always ask!). Good luck,"
"Gerber Formula - Thanks, But No Thanks",http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/strollersandstilettosonemothersbalancingact/gerber-formula-thanks-but-no-thanks,"A couple weeks ago, when I got my first Gerber formula check in the mail, I must admit, I was terribly excited. I'd never actually heard of Gerber formula before, but hey, it was Gerber. And no one makes baby food like Gerber, right? And it was a substantial formula check. I actually had to read the Gerber formula check a couple times to make sure I was reading it correctly. Could it be true? With this baby food formula check I could get a tub of Gerber formula for virtually free??? No way! And since I hadn't seen a Similac baby food formula check in several months now, I was terribly intrigued at the thought of getting a tub of Gerber formula for free... Free is a great thing... And it's Gerber formula... so I instantly trusted it, on name alone. And I'm sure Baby G wouldn't mind switching up her baby food formula a little bit, especially if the entire tub is free. Baby G likes free things. And at seven months old, and demonstrating absolutely no  signs of any formula intolerance  or problems with standard Similac baby food formula, I'm sure she wouldn't have a problem with the Gerber formula. So off to the store we went, Gerber formula check in hand, to get our free tub of Gerber baby food formula. I was thrilled when I checked out. Gerber had just won me over! When I got home, I had second thoughts about the starting Baby G on the Gerber formula. It smelled different, and in my opinion, not in a good way. The Similac formula had a certain neutral scent to it, but the Gerber formula had more of an odor to it. I figured the difference in smells between the baby food formula brands accounted for the fact they were different products, with different makeups, and therefore would probably smell different. And when I fed Baby G her first bottle of Gerber formula, she didn't seem to notice the difference, and she sucked it down the way she had the Similac baby food formula. But then the baby stink set in. My once sweet smelling baby suddenly had incredibly stinking baby poop. She had stinky baby gas. She was just an overall stinky baby... And it wasn't just during diaper changes. Baby G suddenly developed this ever present baby stinky odor to her. Taking into account the fact there had been no other changes to Baby G's diet or environment, the only logical culprit was the Gerber formula. That was disappointing. And despite the fact I gave Baby G ample time to get used to the new baby food formula, the stinky baby poop never went away. The Gerber formula was a fail. We couldn't keep using it, no matter how cheap it was... We went back to Similac and all our odor problems instantly cleared up...     Melanoma Therapy   Learn About an Advanced   Melanoma Treatment Option Here.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Abandoning the Gerber formula was an easy, albeit slightly disappointing decision, especially when the next round of Gerber formula checks arrived in the mail, without a Similac check to be found... But Gerber formula just isn't the right formula for us. So we'll be giving the formula checks away."
This Heart-Stopping Story Proves All New Parents Should Learn Infant CPR,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/heart-stopping-story-proves-all-new-parents-should-learn-infant-CPR/,"You probably never expect to have to perform CPR on an infant. Eleven-year-old Alise Fabregas never thought shed have to, eitheruntil the unthinkable happened, and she saved her little sisters life. Alise was at the hospital with her mom and newborn sister Miranda, who was only two days old,  CBSBoston reports . When Alise and her mom realized that Miranda was choking on her formula, they were terrified. But Elise remembered the CPR training that she had recently learned in her sixth grade health class and immediately sprung into rescue mode. I told mom to turn her around at an angle and pat her on the back, that way the spit up can come out, and I also called the nurse, Alise told local reporters.     Advanced Skin Cancer Med   Get the Facts on Advanced Melanoma   & a Treatment Option that May Help.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Alises story is heart-warming and inspiring, but it also serves as a sobering reminder to new parents. Although its scary to think about, choking is a leading cause of death among infants,  according to the National Safety Council . Babies have smaller airways that are more easily blocked than adults' and bigger kids', and it takes time for them to get the hang of skills like chewing and swallowing. And of course, its no secret that little ones love to explore their world by putting things in their mouths. In an emergency situation where every second counts, being able to identify when your child is choking and knowing how to perform CPR could save your childs life. That's why it's important to take a course in infant CPR. They're available at many community centers, hospitals, fire departments, ambulance corps, the American Red Cross and American Heart Association. You can also ask your child's doctor for recommendations. Unfamiliar with the signs of choking and infant CPR? Here's a brief primer. But don't forget to sign up for that class! What are the signs of infant choking? According to the National Institutes of Health , these signs include: Trouble breathing, with ribs and chest pulled inward. Inability to cry or make much sound. Weak or ineffective coughing. Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling. Bluish skin color. Loss of consciousness. What should you do if your infant is choking? If your baby is coughing hard or crying loudly, let her try to dislodge the object on her own. If her coughs or cries are weak, you should  try to dislodge the object : Lay her face down along your forearm, pointing her head downward, lower than her body. Use the palm of your free hand to give 5 forceful blows between her shoulder blades. If the object doesnt come out, you should: Turn your baby face up, making sure to support her head. Place two fingers in the middle of her breastbone and give 5 quick thrusts down. Give 5 more back blows, followed by 5 more chest thrusts. Continue until the object is dislodged. If your baby loses consciousness, stops breathing, or turns blue, shout for help, tell someone to call 911, and then start infant CPR. If youre alone, shout for help, performCPRfor one minute, then call 911. If your baby is unconscious and you can see the object blocking the airway, remove it with your finger. Then, start  infant CPR . Heres how: Carefully place your infant on her back. Perform 30 chest compressions fast and hard, without pausing. Open her airway. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. If your infant isnt breathing, cover her nose and mouth tightly with your mouth. Then, give two rescue breaths. Continue chest compressions and rescue breathing until your baby recovers, or until help arrives. Always call your pediatrician after a child chokes or loses consciousness, even if you successfully removed the object and the child seems fine. And finally, remember: While choking accidents cant always be prevented, you can take steps to help your baby stay safe. Keep your infant away from small objects, including small foods or toys. Always watch your infant while shes eating, and make sure she isnt crawling while she eats."
FDA Releases New Baby Formula Safety Requirements,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0611/fda-releases-new-baby-formula-safety-requirements.aspx,"Summary: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is releasing new standards aimed at manufacturers to help ensure safe, nutritious formula for infants. By Marygrace Taylor | Posted: June 10, 2014 While breast is best, not all moms are able to breastfeed; nearly 3 million U.S. babies ages 3 months and older get at least some of their calories from  formula . And now,  the FDA has announced  that it is raising quality standards for this important source of baby nutrition. Currently, all formulas are required to meet federal nutrition guidelines, and manufacturers are required to notify the FDA before they market a new product. While new products aren't subject to FDA approval before they hit store shelves, the government agency inspects manufacturing facilities yearly and collects and analyzes product samples. Any formulas found to pose a risk to babies must be recalled. The new standards, which apply only to formulas intended for use by healthy infants without unusual medical or dietary problems, take additional steps to ensure the products are safe and of high quality. The new formula guidelines set enforceable standards for: Good manufacturing practices specifically designed for infant formula, including testing for harmful bacteria like  salmonella  and  cronobacter A requirement for manufacturers to demonstrate that their formulas support normal physical growth Testing for nutrient content in the final product stage, before the formula is sold in stores, and when the formula expires Of course, the new guidelines  don't  mean that formulas available in stores today are unsafe or unhealthy (in fact, the FDA rarely ever needs to recall a formula)  and many manufacturers have already voluntarily applied the guidelines to their products. ""FDA sets high quality standards for the safety and nutritional quality of infant formulas during this critical time of development,"" said Stephen Ostroff, M.D., FDA's acting chief scientist, in an agency press release. To ensure your baby's formula stays safe and nutritious at home, always follow these safe formula feeding practices: Prepare formula correctly.  Mix formula with the exact amount of water on the product label. It's safe to mix formula with tap water that's been boiled for one minute and cooled. If mixing formula with hot water, cool it quickly to 98 degrees before feeding your baby. If you aren't feeding your baby immediately, store mixed formula in the refrigerator. Keep bottles and nipples clean.  Sterilize bottles and nipples before using them for the first time. After that, clean them with hot, soapy water. Warm formula properly.  You don't have to warm your baby's formula. But if you choose to do so, warm the formula in a pot of hot water until it reaches body temperature. Never heat formula in the microwave, which can cause formula to overheat or heat unevenly. Follow storage instructions.  Follow package instructions for storing formula before and after the container is open. Never freeze formula, which can cause contents to separate. Check the expiration date.  All formulas are required to list an expiration date on the packaging. Never feed your infant formula that's expired. 3 Things to Read Next: 3 Secrets to Choosing the Best Formula Formula Feeding: First Steps Side Effects of Soy Formula  The Pros and Cons"
Tips for Breastfeeding Your Twins,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/breastfeeding-twins,"If youre a mom of twins, breastfeeding can be doubly challenging at first: After all, youve got two mouths to feed, two little bodies to balance, and three people who need to figure out this whole breastfeeding thing. Of course  the many benefits of breastfeeding  make it well worth the effort. Once youve fallen into the rhythm of nursing your babies (and you will!), youll find its not only possible but convenient (you wont have bottles to wash) and doubly rewarding. Heres how to set yourself up for success when youre breastfeeding twins. Finding a twin nursing schedule For the first few weeks,  infants need to breastfeed  eight to 12 times per day. That breaks down to about once every two to three hours, day and night. Each session should last about 20 to 30 minutesbut wait for each baby to signal he or shes done before calling it quits (the suck-swallow pattern will slow down to about four sucks to one swallow). In the beginning, try nursing your twins on the same schedule. However keep in mind that even identical twins have different personalities, appetites and nursing patterns. So try to tune into the needs of each; one may need to nurse more frequently than the other. Some moms like to let the hungrier baby dictate the feeding schedule of both. Others feed on each babys demand during the day and stick to a schedule at night. Whatever you choose, just keep extra-careful records to make sure each baby is well fed at each feeding. Tips & positions to feed twins at the same time Since you've got two breasts and two mouths to feed, why not nurse them together, tandem-style? While you may want to start nursing your babies one at a time until they get the hang of latching on, once everyones comfortable nursing, an obvious advantage of tandem nursing is that you dont have to spend all day and night nursing (first Baby A, then Baby B, and back to Baby A and so on). A few tips: Consider a nursing pillow.  One designed especially for twins can make it easier to position your babies. Or you can use two regular pillows or rolled-up towels. Get set up.  When youre first getting started, position the pillow and have someone hand you each baby, latching on one at a time. If you're alone, set yourself up on the floor in front of the couch (with lots of pillows). Put the babies in their bouncy seats on either side of where you'll be sitting. Fasten the pillow around your waist and position the babies one at a time onto the pillow, then latch. Find  the right nursing position .  Try positioning both babies in the football or the cradle holds, using the pillow to support their heads. Or combine the cradle hold and the football hold, again using the pillow for support. Experiment until both you and your babies are comfortable. Alternate breasts.  Remember to switch breasts for each baby at each feeding (or at least every switch sides every day) so both breasts are stimulated equally. Nursing triplets (or more).  If youve got three or more babies to feed, nurse two at a time, then nurse the third baby afterward, remembering to switch which baby gets solo sucking time. Do what works for you.  Dont worry if tandem nursing isnt right for you, even with practice. You can either bottle-feed one baby (using pumped milk or formula, if youre supplementing) while nursing the other (and then switch off), or nurse one after the other. Whats important is to do what works for you and your babies. Focus on your latch.  Breastfeeding more shouldnt  cause your nipples to be sore or cracked ; soreness is usually caused by a poor latch (or, possibly, thrush). So if your nipples are extra tender, try a lanolin cream to ease the pain and spend extra time working on your latch with each baby. How many calories does breastfeeding twins burn? Breastfeeding one baby burns up to an additional 500 calories per day. That means when youre nursing twins, youll burn roughly 1,000 calories every day. How many calories do you need to breastfeed twins? Doing so much feeding and burning so many calories means youll also have to do more eating. To keep fueled when you're breastfeeding twins, youll need 400 to 500 calories above your pre-pregnancy needs for each babyor roughly 1,000 additional daily calories total. You may need to increase your caloric intake as your babies grow bigger and hungrier. Or you may need to decrease your count if you supplement nursing with formula and/or solids, or if you have considerable fat reserves youd like to burn. To keep fueled, stick to a sensible, balanced  breastfeeding diet  and drink lots of water. Youll also need an extra calcium serving for that extra baby for a total of six (though you can also tap into a calcium supplement to help reach that goal). Producing enough milk for two babies: How to increase your supply If youre breastfeeding twins, nursing frequently keeps your supply up. But if youre feeding on demand and still having trouble with your milk supply, regular stimulation from a pump one will help. Since most of your milk comes in the first five minutes, multiple short sessions each day boost your supply better than fewer longer sessions. Aim for a schedule of about four times a day in addition to nursing your babies. An electric double pump will become your new best friendespecially since it can help you get precious extra hours of sleep while someone else uses your milk to feed your babies. RELATED:  How to Know If Your Baby Is Getting Enough to Eat Exclusively breastfeeding vs. supplementing for twins The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding until your babies are 6 months old and continued breastfeeding to at least age 1. But when youre breastfeeding twins, this recommendation can be hard to follow. That's okay! Don't beat yourself up if you can't exclusively breastfeed your twins for six monthsor even two or three. Supplementing with formula can actually help you breastfeed for longer. However since supplementing can decrease your milk supply due to a lack of demand, aim to pump regularly. Getting help breastfeeding your twins Many moms struggle at first with nursing twins, so dont be afraid to ask for help. Your pediatrician,  a lactation consultant  and/or  a doula  who has experience with multiples can offer support. Keep in mind that the Affordable Care Act guarantees that your health insurance  should cover breastfeeding assistance  from a professional at no cost to you. Also invaluable: advice from other moms of multiples who are breastfeeding. Updated 10/10/16"

Photographer Turns Rosie the Riveter into Mom the Breastfeeder,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0427/photographer-turns-rosie-the-riveter-into-mom-the-breastfeeder,"With all the amazing photos of breastfeeding moms out there, it's easy for non-moms to assume that it's a super simple process. Simply place child to boob and watch her latch and eat! But, as breastfeeding moms know, it's rarely that simple. There a million and one reasons why breastfeeding can be challenging, and sometimes a little inspiration is needed to keep on. Just ask Missouri mom Alex James. She was having a hard time nursing her son, Carson, but didn't want to give up. ""The price of formula is ridiculous and Ive heard all the advantages of breastfeeding,  James told KMBC . I was determined to do it. I wanted to prove that I could stick with something. She shared her struggles with photographer Sarah Fowler during a recent photo session. Fowler, a fellow mom, understood the struggle well  and it sparked an idea. The pair modeled the shoot around the iconic ""We Can Do It"" poster featuring Rosie the Riveter created by J. Howard Miller. That poster was meant to inspire women to go into the factories during World War II, but over the years it's evolved into a statement that women can do anything. That includes breastfeeding. The photos of James show her styled like Rosie, with one big difference: She's breastfeeding little Carson. ""I am hoping moms will see that you shouldn't have to hide when you feed your child, and you also shouldn't have to cover them up. Feeding your child is the most natural thing ever, but it's also the most bonding thing ever,""  James told Cosmopolitan.com  about the photos. More importantly: ""I loved the amount of confidence it gave me,"" she said.

3 Secrets to Choosing the Best Baby Formula,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/3-secrets-to-choosing-the-best-baby-formula.aspx,"One of the biggest decisions you'll make early on for your baby is between breast and formula. And if you choose the latter, you'll soon face the hurdle many new moms struggle with: finding the best  baby formula  for your child. Here's the thing: there's not a clear answer to this search. The type and brand of formula you use depends heavily on what works best not only for your lifestyle but for your baby. Here are some tips to help you find what works best for your family. Cost vs. ease of use.  There are three main types of formula: pre-made bottles, ready-to-pour, and powdered formula that you mix with water at home. The pre-made bottles are the easiest to use: you just snap on a nipple and you're ready to go. The powdered formula is the messiest in terms of preparation, because you have to scoop the powdered mix into each individual bottle and mix with water. From a cost perspective, the pre-mixed bottles are significantly more expensive than powdered formula. And in terms of usage and price, the ready-to-pour formula falls smack dab in the middle of both scales. From my own experience, the time that it actually takes to mix the powdered formula definitely outweighs the cost of the pre-mixed kindso we are a powdered-formula household! Shelf life.  If you're planning on stocking up on formula so you don't have to hit the store as often (or to save money by purchasing in bulk), it's important to realize that different styles of formula have varying shelf lives. Powdered formula lasts longer than you'd even need it to when it's unopened, and up to 30 days after it's open. The liquid formulas have a much shorter shelf life  usually two to four days once opened. And once the formula's in the bottle, pre-mixed formulas are only good for an hour, but powdered formula can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. The choice, again, really comes down to whether it's more important to you to have easy-to-prepare formula on hand or a longer shelf-life.

Just like adults, babies have varying tastes and needs. Some babies are fussier than others and need an anti-colic formula. Some need a formula that's designed for sensitive tummies. And still others aren't picky at all. So try a bunch of small containers of formulas until you find the best baby formula for  your  baby, then stock up on one specific kind. We ended up trying a few different styles of powdered formula and ultimately settled on one that helps reduce gas...and it's working out wonderfully for my little man!

"Colic in Babies: Signs, Causes and Tips for Parents",http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/health-and-safety/what-is-colic/,"You bring your newborn home, and for weeks you marvel at your baby who does little more than sleep, eat, pee and cry sometimes. Then one day a few weeks later, she erupts in ear-shattering wails, complete with clenched fists, flailing legs and an unhappy red face. No matter what you try, you cant comfort yourcrying baby  and that's not all: She repeats these heartbreaking, stressful episodes every night at the same time for what seems like forever. Welcome to the world of colic. More in this article: What is colic? Colic symptoms What's the difference between colic and normal crying? What causes it? Colic remedies Should you see the doctor? Coping with colic What Is Colic? The reality is, all babies cry : It's the best (and only) way for them to communicate their needsat this tender age. And as parents, were biologically programmed to respond so those needs get met. But in babies with colic, the crying starts suddenly for no apparent reason  and has no apparent cure. ADVERTISING Colic is not a disease or diagnosis but a combination of baffling behaviors. It's really just a catch-all term for problem crying in otherwise healthy babies  the problem being, theres no solution to it besides the passing of time. And its common, occurring in one in five infants. Episodes can go on for hours at a time, sometimes late into the night. Worst of all, try as you might  and try you will  it's extremely difficult to calm a colicky baby, which only compounds your own frustration, worry and exhaustion. Doctors usually diagnose colic based on the ""rules of three."" Your baby's crying: Lasts at least three hours at a stretch Occurs at least three days a week Persists for at least three weeks in a row Of course, some babies are colic overachievers, wailing for far more hours, days and even weeks at a time. The good news is that colic doesn't last. Most bouts peak at around 6 weeks and then typically start to taper off by 10 to 12 weeks. By 3 months (typically a little later in preterm babies), most colicky infants seems to be miraculously cured. The colic may stop suddenly  or end gradually, with some good and some bad days, until they are all good. In the meantime, a little knowledge and a lot of patience will help you survive until the storm subsides. Symptoms and Signs of Colic in Your Baby How do you know for sure if your baby's colicky? In addition to the rules of three, here are a few further colic signs and symptoms: Crying occurs at the same time every day (usually in the late afternoon or early evening, but it can vary). Crying seems to occur for no reason (not because baby has a dirty diaper or is hungry or tired). Baby may pull up his legs, clench his fists and generally move his legs and arms more. He also often will close his eyes or open them very wide, furrow his brow, even hold his breath briefly. Bowel activity may increase, and he may pass gas or spit up. Eating and sleeping are disrupted by the crying  baby frantically seeks a nipple only to reject it once sucking has begun, or dozes for a few moments only to wake up screaming. What's the Difference Between Colic and Ordinary Crying? There isn't a clear definition of exactly what colic is or how (and if) it differs from other types of crying. But doctors typically agree that the difference between colic and ordinary crying in that baby seems inconsolable, crying turns to screaming, and the ordeal lasts for at least three hours and sometimes much longer (occasionally nearly around the clock, much to the tired and fraught parents' dismay). Most often, colicky periods recur daily, though some babies take an occasional night off. What Causes Colic? While the exact cause of colic is a mystery, experts do know its not the result of genetics or anything that happened during pregnancy or childbirth. Nor is it any reflection on parenting skills (or lack of them, in case you're wondering). And it's also not anyone's fault. That said, here are some theories on what's behind colicky crying: Overstimulated senses. One possible explanation: Newborns have a built-in mechanism for tuning out sights and sounds around them, which allows them to sleep and eat without being disturbed by their environment. Near the end of the first month, however, this mechanism disappears  leaving babies more sensitive to the stimuli in their surroundings. With so many new sensations coming at them, some infants become overwhelmed, often at the end of the day. To release that stress, they cry(and cry and cry). Colic ends, the theory goes, when baby learns how to filter out some environmental stimuli and, in doing so, avoids a sensory overload. An immature digestive system. Digesting food is a big task for a baby's brand new gastrointestinal system. As a result, food may pass through too quickly and not break down completely, resulting in pain from gas in the intestines. Infant acid reflux. Research has found that  infant GERD  (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is sometimes a colic trigger. Infant GERD is often the result of an underdeveloped lower esophageal sphincter, the muscle that keeps stomach acid from flowing back up into the throat and mouth, which can irritate the esophagus. Symptoms include frequent spitting up, poor eating and irritability during and after feedings. The good news is, most babies outgrow GERD by age 1 (and colic usually goes away long before then). Food allergies or sensitivity. Some experts believe that colic is the result of an allergy to milk protein (or lactose intolerance) in formula-fed babies. More rarely, colic may be a reaction to specific foods in Moms diet in breastfed babies. Either way, these allergies or sensitivity can cause tummy pain that may set off colicky behavior. Tobacco exposure. Several studies show that moms who smoke during or after pregnancy are more likely to have babies with colic; secondhand smoke may also be a culprit. Though the link exists, its unclear how cigarette smoke might be related to colic. The bottom line for many more significant health reasons: Dont smoke or let anyone else smoke around your baby. Colic Remedies In addition to frustration and exhaustion, you may experience feelings of inadequacy and guilt as you try in vain to soothe your baby . So while staying calm is easier said than done, these soothing strategies may help ease the strain until colicpasses. Just give each a fair shot before you switch to another (and don't pull out too many tricks at one time, or you'll overload baby's circuits  and step up the crying you're trying to stop). If you suspect overstimulation: Respond.  Crying is a baby's only way of communicating her needs. But it's also her only way of wielding any control at all over a vast and bewildering new environment: She cries, you come running to her side  powerful stuff when you're otherwise completely powerless. In fact, studies show that responding promptly to your baby's cries will reduce her crying in the long run.  Excise excitement.  Limit visitors and exposing your baby to new experiences in stimulating environments, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening. Watch how your baby responds to certain stimuli  and steer clear of any that seem to offend. Create calm.  Trying to make her environment peaceful might help her relax. Dim the lights, speak or sing in soothing tones (or don't speak at all) and keep other noise and distractions to a minimum. If you suspect gastrointestinal issues: Apply pressure to babys tummy. Some colicky babies find relief when pressure is placed on the abdomen  and the power of touch alone can be very soothing for both mother and child. So place your infant face-down on your lap or upright with his tummy against your shoulder, or try the colic carry, where your little one lies face-down with his belly resting on your arm. Then gently rub or pat his back as you hold him. Ask about antigas drops.  Studies show that reducing gas may reduce the discomfort (and crying). So ask your pediatricianabout trying  gas drops , which can relieve your baby's symptoms. Though research hasnt yet shown that this treatment definitively helps with colic, your doctor may think it's worth a try. Consider probiotics. Probiotic drops may curb the crying in some colicky babies, probably because they ease tummy troubles (probiotic bacteria grow naturally in the digestive tract and help promote intestinal health). Again, research has yet to back this up, but check with your pediatrician to see if you should give it a go. Try gripe water.  In the category of little evidence, lots of anecdotes is  gripe water , a natural colic remedy made of herbs and sodium bicarbonate in drops. Many parents swear by gripe water, but no reliable studies have shown its effectiveness in reducing colic symptoms. And just because something is natural doesn't mean it's safe  so always ask your doctor before giving your baby that or any other herbal remedies. Watch what you eat. If youre breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about whether you should try temporarily eliminating any foods from your diet that can cause tummy troubles, such as gas-causing cruciferous veggies (cabbage, cauliflower), acidic citrus fruits ,or allergenic foods (dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish). Ask about switching formulas. For some  formula-fed infants , swapping a standard variety for one designed for sensitive tummies or one that doesn't contain cow's milk can make a difference. Studies have found that giving colicky babies hypoallergenic whey-hydrolyzed formula decreases colic symptoms  in some babies. Just be sure to get your doctors approval before making the switch. Also, steer clear of  casein-hydrolyzed formula  or  partially hydrolyzed formulas  as therapies for colic  there simply isn't enough evidence that they work. Remember, you should never give your baby any medication, herbal or otherwise, without talking to your pediatrician first. And always talk to your doctor before making major changes in your diet or your babys. Other calming remedies for colicky babies: Get close.  Not only does cuddling, wearing or carrying your baby give her the pleasure of security and physical closeness to you (and after 9 months of constant closeness, that may be just what baby's crying for), but it may help you tune in better to her needs. Swaddle.  Toss a blanket in the dryer and while it's still warm,  wrap it snugly around your baby . The combination of warmth and the feeling of security may help dry babys tears. Make white noise. The hum of the vacuum cleaner or dryer can be comforting to babies (it reminds them of the womb). You may even want to invest in a white-noise machine. Play soothing music. A crying baby might also respond to the quiet singing of a lullaby or a softly playing classical music CD. Other infants enjoy the sounds of nature or the whir of a fan. Repeating ""shh"" or ""ahh"" to your little one can also help. Experiment to find something your baby seems to like. Offer a pacifier.  Some colicky babies seem to want to eat all the time  and that might be because sucking is soothing, not because theyre hungry. So if your child seems ravenous all the time and adequate feedings don't seem to satisfy him,  a pacifier might help . Check in with your doctor if you're not sure whether baby is getting enough to eat at mealtimes, though. Get out of the house.  Sometimes, just a change to an outdoor location will magically change a baby's mood. Movement can help, too. Take your baby for a walk in the stroller or in a sling or carrier, or strap her into the car seat for a drive (but turn around and head home if the crying continues in the car  otherwise it could distract you from the road). Should I Take My Baby to the Doctor? While the odds are that your babys daily screaming sessions are due to colic, its a good idea to talk the situation over with your doctor  if only to get some reassurance and maybe a few extra soothing strategies. Describing the crying (its duration, intensity, pattern, any variation from the norm and any accompanying symptoms) will also help the doctor rule out any underlying medical condition (like reflux, an infection or a milk allergy) that could be triggering the crying. For Parents: Coping with Colic Though it can safely be said that even hours and hours of daily crying doesn't seem to hurt a baby, it certainly does leave its mark on parents. Listening to a baby's screams can be heartbreaking, upsetting and anxiety-provoking and can take a physical and emotional toll. To cope with colicky crying that just won't quit, try the following: Break it up . A fresh set of arms sometimes induces calm in a crying baby. If there are two parents at home during baby's witching hours, make sure colic duty is divided up equally between the two of you (an hour on, an hour off, a night on, a night off, or whatever arrangement works best). Take a break . It's important to respond to crying, which is an infant's only way to communicate. But every once in a while, taking a 10- to 15- minute break during a particularly trying crying marathon won't hurt  and it might help both of you get through this challenging phase of babyhood. Tune out a little . Use earplugs, noise-canceling headphones or listen to music to lessen the effect of your baby's wails. Don't tune out your baby so much that you can't hear him at all or for long periods of time, but at least the bouts of wailing won't be as loud for a little while. Talk about it . Do a little crying yourself  on a willing shoulder: your spouse's, the pediatrician's, a family member's, a friend's. Just knowing you're not alone in the world of inconsolable babies can make a world of difference. Get help . If youre at the end of your rope, dont hesitate ask for help  whether from your partner, mother, friend or babysitter. Keep in mind, too, that this shall pass: Just when you think you can't take another night of it, the crying will let up  and then it's gone forever. As wiped-out as you may be, give yourself a well-earned pat on the back. You've just survived your first major challenge of parenthood. Updated 12/06/16"
Does Your Tot Need Toddler Formula?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/does-your-tot-need-toddler-formula-.aspx,"When my son turned one, I was anxious about switching from breastfeeding to  cow's milk . Out of curiosity, I asked my pediatrician about toddler formula at my son's 12-month visit. Was it possible he'd be missing out on something after the big switcheroo? Should I try a big kid formula instead? My pediatrician calmed my fears and told me that formula just isn't necessary for healthy kids over 1 year old. She recommended whole milk (to the tune of 16-18 ounces a day), along with a healthy variety of solid foods. What I came to realize is that formula for toddlers is no more than a marketing ploy to entice parents to continue shelling out their money on an expensive product. Most pediatricians agree with mine  that there really is no benefit in choosing a big kid formula over regular cow's milk. Yet, manufacturers still stock the shelves with these formulas  probably thanks to overanxious parents just like me. While giving your child formula isn't harmful, it might be setting your child up for bad habits. You don't want your child to overdo it on any kind of milk or formula. After one year of age, a good majority of nutrients should be coming from solid foods. The nutrition in milk  or  formula just isn't going to cut it. Yummy-tasting formula for toddlers may entice a little one to keep drinking even after she's full, which will lead her to eat less solid foods overall.

Giving Newborns Formula in the Hospital Deters Breastfeeding,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0218/giving-newborns-formula-in-the-hospital-deters-breastfeeding.aspx,"Summary: A new study has found that moms who planned to breastfeed their newborns but are then given formula to feed their babies in the hospital are more likely to quit breastfeeding early. By Sharon Mazel | Posted: February 18, 2014 You start with the best intentions in mind  to feed your new bundle of joy nature's best food  your breast milk. But you're tired from those killer contractions and the seemingly endless pushing marathon you just went through to deliver your baby, and you're frustrated by those unproductive first attempts to breastfeed your screaming newborn. And thenas if it's manna from heavena bottle of formula arrives  either because a well-meaning nurse thinks it's what you want or because your sister-in-law who is visiting swears by the bottle. And you're not sure you're producing enough milk, or your baby isn't figuring out how to latch on after one or two tries, or your nipples are cracked...so you put the bottle to baby's mouth, and presto  quiet infant happily sucking away. You'll go back to nursing next feeding, you reason. All is good. But is it? Truth is, new moms who intend to  breastfeed their babies  but then feed their newborns formula in the hospital are less likely to fully breastfeed their babies by the time their babies are two months old and are more likely to quit breastfeeding early, even if they had hoped to breastfeed longer, according to a new study published in  The Journal of Pediatrics . And, the more formula a baby gets in the hospital, the less likely the mom will continue breastfeeding. Researchers from UC Davis Medical Center in California looked at nearly 400 newborns in the hospital and then followed them over the next two months. All of these moms intended to exclusively breastfeed their babies for at least a week and did not plan to use formula in the hospital. Around half of the newborns were exclusively breastfed in the hospital. The other half received at least some formula in the hospital. Over the next two months, breastfeeding dropped dramatically in the formula group. In fact, early formula use nearly doubled the risk of formula use during baby's first month and nearly tripled the risk of ending all breastfeeding by the end of the second month. Between the first and second month, 68 percent of the babies receiving in-hospital formula were not fully breastfed, compared to 37 percent of babies who were exclusively breastfed in the hospital. After two months, 33 percent of the formula babies were not being breastfed at all. By contrast, only 10 percent of the hospital breastfed group had stopped breastfeeding. Bottom line: If you're planning to breastfeed  exclusively or even partly  your best bet is to keep formula off your baby's menu for at least the first few weeks of life. Do keep in mind, however, that sometimes formula is necessary for medical reasons and in that case your baby is best off getting the formula he needs. Remember, breast is really only best when it nourishes your baby well. And if, in the rare case that your breast milk isn't nourishing your baby in the optimum way, then it's certainly not best for baby. Remember, too, that just because you're giving your newborn formula that's medically necessary doesn't mean you'll have to give up completely on your breastfeeding dreams. It's likely you'll still be able to make it work  with the combo. It'll just be more of challenge. But in the majority of cases, formula won't be needed  and in fact can deter even short term breastfeeding success. So stick with the feeding plan nature intended  and make sure you get the breastfeeding support you need (by enlisting the help of a lactation consultant) to make your dreams of nursing your little one a successful reality. 3 More Things to Read: Getting Started Breastfeeding Benefits of Breastfeeding Breastfeeding Problems"
Arsenic Levels in Baby Formula Are Higher Than Breast Milk,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0223/arsenic-levels-in-baby-formula-are-higher-than-breast-milk.aspx,"Summary: There are higher levels of arsenic in baby formula than in breast milk, finds a new study. Even so, parents of bottle-fed babies don't need to toss the powder, experts say. The mere mention of the word ""arsenic"" in association with your baby's food is enough to stop any parent cold. So if you're concerned about the disturbing headlines spurred by a new  Dartmouth College study  which found that levels of arsenic in baby formula are higher than levels of arsenic in breast milk, you're definitely not alone. But there's good news: The findings are a lot less scary than they sound. Researchers measured arsenic levels in home tap water as well as in the urine of 72 six-week-old infants and the breast milk from nine mothers living in New Hampshire. Arsenic concentrations in the urine of formula-fed infants was 7.5 times higher than in the urine of breast milk-fed infants. Among the formula-fed infants, the formula powder itself accounted for most of the children's arsenic exposure, since arsenic concentrations in the tap water were already low.     Inoperable Skin Cancer   Get Information on an Advanced   Skin Cancer Treatment Option.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com     While the study was small and didn't look at every type of formula on the market, the issue likely affects all types of infant formulas. The good news, it seems, is that breastfeeding appears to be an effective way to expose babies to less arsenic, which can be toxic in high amounts. Still, arsenic exposure for almost  all  of the babies in the study  whether they were breast- or formula-fed  was considered very low. (The one exception was a baby who was fed formula made from private well water, which contained higher arsenic levels than the public tap water used to make formula for the other babies.) ""Arsenic is a  naturally occurring element , and it would be difficult to completely remove it [from formula],"" says lead study author Kathryn Cottingham, Ph.D., Professor of Biological Sciences at Darmouth College. ""We want to emphasize that this is good news, because arsenic exposure was really low for most of these babies."" Arsenic is an element that occurs naturally in soil, minerals and water, which is why it commonly ends up making its way into the natural ingredients used to make formula. In cow's formula, for example, the cow could be ingesting aresenic in her food or water; in soy formula, the soybeans could be picking up some arsenic from the soil where they're growing. In the U.S., however, any exposure from our food and water is considered generally low enough that it isn't problematic, as long as your water doesn't come from a private well (in which case arsenic levels can be higher and should be tested). Most new moms are well versed in the countless ways that  breastfeeding is good for babies , and this study certainly adds to the list. But if you  feed your baby formula , experts agree that the findings shouldn't make you stop. ""I don't think this is something where parents should feel like they've been poisoning their kid,"" says Jerry Paulson, M.D., Chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Environmental Health. Still, if your baby takes formula, is there anything else you can or should be doing to minimize his or her exposure to arsenic? If you get your water from a public source, you can learn about local arsenic levels by checking with your water supplier (though if your water has too much arsenic, suppliers are  required to notify you ). More important, though, is if your water comes from a private well. In that case, it's essential to have your  water tested for arsenic  annually and switch to a safer source (like bottled water) if the levels are too high, Cottingham says.

Many Breast Milk Ingredients Can't Be Duplicated in Formula,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0719/many-breast-milk-ingredients-can-t-be-duplicated-in-formula.aspx,"Many people who argue that ""breast is best"" believe that breast milk ingredients are far superior to the ingredients in infant formula. In recent news that breastfeeding advocates will celebrate, researchers have uncovered approximately  100 components found in breast milk  that cannot be duplicated in artificial baby milk. Many mothers and supporters of breastfeeding have long believed that human breast milk was superior to formula. This research now confirms this belief. Although many infant formula companies claim to make baby formula with ingredients that are comparable to breast milk, the truth is that many of the components of breast milk cannot be adequately replicated in formula. For example, breast milk contains less protein and  iron  than most formulas. However, the added protein and iron in formula is necessary because babies utilize both nutrients in breast milk far better than they digest either from formula. That is, infant formulas require higher contents of protein and iron because most of both nutrients are not absorbed by the baby but are simply passed out in dirty diapers. Breast milk is also better in terms of carbohydrates and lactose. As Dr. Hessa Khalfan Al Ghazal, the Director of the Executive Committee for the Sharjah Baby Friendly Emirate Campaign in Sharjah, explained: ""This lactose superiority is a double-sided advantage, because research has conclusively proved that lactose contributes to the development of a larger brain. This makes breast milk a ""smarter"" choice  both literally and figuratively.""

After Breastfeeding -- Switching to Formula,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/parentingtwodaughtersonzerosleep/after-breastfeeding-switching-to-formula,"I really wanted to breastfeed my second daughter for at least 6 months and really for a whole year. When she finally got the hang of latching, which took a while every time I nursed her, I thought great she's got it down and I will have no problem breastfeeding her at all. Well, after 6 weeks she refused to latch anymore so I had no choice but to put her on formula. After breastfeeding her for 6 weeks and feeling so good about it, I actually cried when I had to give her formula. My first daughter couldn't get the latching thing down and she was formula fed. It was complete nightmare with her trying to figure out what worked for her because she seemed to get a bellyache from every kind of formula I had her on. We had her on regular, gentle ease, and soy before the Dr told me she had an issue with lactose. Of course once we figured out what her problem was it was smooth sailing from there. So, after breastfeeding Maddy for 6 weeks and knowing that she had an issue with the lactose that was in my breast milk, I took no chances at all and just gave her a lactose free formula. She loved drinking from a bottle, which I believe is the reason why she refused to latch on to me anymore. Why do all that work when I can do less work and get my food faster, right? So, she went right on Similac Sensitive Formula, which worked wonders for her. She actually did better on the formula then she did with breastfeeding, there was no more violent throwing up episodes and belly aches to do deal with, so eventually I started to feel better about giving her formula. Kind of ironic how breast milk is the best thing for a baby but my breast milk was actually making my child miserable. But, it was an easy transition for us. She started sleeping longer stretches at night and other people could now feed her, which was wonderful for me! Now if only getting my milk to dry up was as easy as it was to switch Madysen from breast milk to formula because that was a painful nightmare and a whole other story!

The Only Thing That Drastically Changed When I Weaned My Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/the-only-thing-that-drastically-changed-when-i-weaned-my-baby.aspx,"I've always considered myself a pro-feed-the-babies-however-you-want kind of advocate; it just so happened that breastfeeding was how I wanted to feed mine -- not because I found it superior to formula or any other high horse reason. Rather, I intended to nurse my babies because it seemed like the more convenient option and, not only was it good for baby, but it was said to be good for me, too. Plus, it was F-R-E-E. With my oldest daughter, Marlo, my boobs cooperated and proved themselves A+ students from beginning to end. We had some normal growing pains when we first started out, of course, due to Marlo's piranha-like latch and an intensely painful let down. With regards to weaning, Marlo decided at 11 months old that she was simply done. She swatted me away one morning, and never asked for it again. She made it very easy, and I was and continue to be grateful for how easy that transition was for the both of us.

I'd assumed that it would be as easy as the first time. Maybe even easier because my boobs had been there and done that. I should've known better. Two seconds earth side, Edie found my breast and latched right on. Due to all of the adrenaline running through me from birth, I barely noticed how painful it was until 12 hours later when I looked down: My nipples looked like raw hamburger meat. They were bleeding, and her latch felt like burning daggers. I would physically brace myself and have to work up the courage to allow her latch on. I'd scream out in pain before sobbing through the entire feed, incredibly defeated and confused as to why things weren't working as well as they had before. After three days of hell, and at the urging of my doula, we finally broke down and paid for a lactation consultant to come to our home. In a matter of minutes, she diagnosed Edie with an upper lip and tongue tie. We very quickly made the decision to have both snipped by a specialist. Even though there was very little recovery time for her -- we're talking mere seconds- -- it took another month for me to heal. Sadly, by then, the emotional damage had already been done: I developed intense anxiety about nursing and began to resent the entire experience. But I pushed on. Why did I continue for six more months? I'm not sure. Maybe it's because I felt like I should? Maybe it's because I feared judgment. (Say what you will, but formula-feeding mamas  do  get judged by some. Which is CRAP.) Maybe it was because I wanted to give her the same experience I gave her older sister. What I do know is that why I continued isn't nearly as important as why I finally came to the decision to stop. Simply? I was miserable. I've always believed that breastfeeding is a relationship between two people: It needs to make both mom and baby happy and fulfilled in order for it to be successful. As desperately as I wanted that relationship with Edie to be a cherished and jointly beneficial one, it became blindingly evident to me, my husband, and closest friends and loved ones that it was neither. So, I stopped. Luckily, Edie seemed to have no issues with the transition as she was already comfortable taking a bottle, and we had been supplementing with formula on date nights or when she was occasionally with a sitter. My hormones appeared to take the biggest hit and had me feeling very blue for a week or two but it was very manageable. The only thing that seemed to drastically change after weaning her was this: I was happy again. I wasn't stressed about my supply or how much she milk was getting. I was no longer frustrated that she was so restless at the breast and clawing my skin as she nursed. I was no longer exhausted from feeding a human with my body around the clock. I no longer resented her for the constant demand that left me feeling so despondent. I was also grateful that I could leave her with my husband or a sitter without having to pump or rush home to feed her. Seeing as how the lack of independence is the thing I grapple with the most since becoming a mother, having this increased freedom was such a positive force in my overall well being. ALSO:  Breastfeeding Problems Too often we make ourselves out to be martyrs for our children without even realizing how that sacrifice is hindering our own happiness or growth. That's not the example I want to set for my daughters. The example I want to set for them is that I did my best with the hand I was given and that, instead of suffering through something that was making me miserable, I fixed it and owned it. One day, when they are old enough to understand or when they're thinking about becoming a mother and they ask me for advice on matters like this, I think they'll look back and be proud of me for making my own physical, emotional, and mental well being a priority. After all, that's exactly what we're hoping to teach them to do, isn't it? How did you know it was time to wean?

Baby's Weight Gain Linked to Risk of Childhood Hypertension,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/0112/how-early-eating-habits-may-be-linked-to-risk-of-childhood-hypertension.aspx,"If you thought high blood pressure was something only adults have to deal with, think again. Unfortunately, more than one out of every 10 children has hypertension these days, according to a new study published in a journal associated with the American Heart Association which in turn increases risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Which is why experts say it's so important to identify what causes high blood pressure in kids: So parents and doctors can work to help reduce the risk and keep kids healthier. It's already been shown by some research that babies born at an obese birthweight have an increased risk of elevated blood pressure. Rapid weight gain during childhood also ups the risks, but little has been known about the timing of weight gain in infancy and childhood as it relates to blood pressure later in life  until this latest research. What the Study Found The study, published in the February issue of the journal Hypertension, found that rapid weight gain during the first six months of life and in the preschool years appears to be a risk factor for elevated blood pressure in childhood .     Advanced Skin Cancer   Learn More About an Advanced   Skin Cancer Treatment Option.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston looked at nearly 1,000 children from birth to childhood, studying their birthweight as well as their BMI (body mass index) and length/height changes at four intervals: birth to 6 months, 6 months to 1 year, 1 to 2 years, and 2 to 3 years. They then looked at the connection between those data points and blood pressure at age 6 to 10 years old. The researchers found that gains in BMI during two intervals in particular  birth to 6 months and 2 to 3 years  are associated with higher blood pressure during school age, even when birth weight is taken into account. Knowing that gaining too much weight too quickly during the first six months after birth and during the preschool years ups the risk of high blood pressure in kids can help parents focus on strategies to reduce the chances of too much weight gain during those crucial time periods, giving their little ones a healthier start in life and a better chance of a lifetime of cardiovascular health. How to Keep Your Baby's Weight Gain at a Healthy Rate Many new parents worry that their little ones aren't gaining enough weight, especially in the beginning. Fortunately, your child's pediatrician will be tracking little one's weight at each visit  and as long as your cutie is staying on or around her weight/length (and/or BMI) curve, without big dips or surges, you should feel good about your child's weight gain. Here are a few tips on how to keep your baby's weight gain at a healthy rate, especially between birth to 6 months and 2 to 3 years old that seem to be crucial for an unhealthy blood pressure later in childhood: Birth to 6 months Breastfeed if possible, and watch for baby's cues. Not only has breastfeeding been linked to lower blood pressure later in life, but italso allows a baby to be in charge of her appetite, giving her the opportunity to stop when she's had her fill. A formula-fed baby may be urged to keep feeding until the bottle is emptied, increasing the chances of greater weight gain. So if you're not breastfeeding, be sure to listen to baby's cues. Feed for hunger's sake only (not when crying because she's bored in the stroller ortired). And don't push baby to finish her bottle if she's ready to quit,even if there's still some formula left. Don't start solids too early.  Feeding your baby solids too soon (before 5 to 6 months) can lead to too much weight gain. And don't add baby cereal to the bottle, either. That'll add too many calories too easily (not to mention that it's unsafe for baby). Be sure, too, that as you introduce more solids, the amount of breastmilk or formula you're feeding baby goes down accordingly. Again, watch for baby's hunger cues and try to feed her only when she's hungry. Skip the juice. Babies under age 6 months should never be given juice to drink, according to the AAP. That's because infants who fill up on juice (empty nutritionally, high on sugar, high on calories) have no room left in their tender appetites for important breastmilk or formula, which can result ingaining too much weight. Toddler and preschool years Don't get juiced. You'll need to be mindful of the juice habit even when your little one has reached the toddler and preschool years, because too much juice (and all its sugar) can lead to too much weight gain. Kids up to age 6 should drink no more than 4 to 6 ounces of 100 percent juice total per day. To make those ounces of fruit juice last longer without any extra sugar, dilute them with water. Or skip juice entirely  it's not a must-serve. Steer clear of sugary drinks. According to some estimates, American children  get 10 to 15 percent of their daily calories from sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, fruit punches and sports drinks). These drinks are one of the biggest sources of refined sugar and empty calories in a child's diet  and a major factor in childhood obesity. Teach  healthy eating habits by example. Limit processed foods, especially those which are high in fat, sugar, cholesterol and sodium, and focus instead on fresh, nutritionally dense foods : lean beef and poultry, fish, reduced-fat dairy, brightly colored vegetables and fruit, and whole-grain breads, pastas and cereals. And be sure to pile up those same foods on your plate, too. Don't reward yo ur tot with treats That can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food, which in turn can lead to too much weight gain. Get moving. Being physically fit helps keep weight gain in a healthy range, even for kids. And while most active tots and preschoolers don't need extra prodding to run around, be sure yours isn't turning into a couch potato early on. That means limiting TV watching and other screen time and making sure you provide activities for her that'll keep her moving .

Organic Baby Formula and What to Consider Before Buying,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/organic-baby-formula-and-what-to-consider-before-buying.aspx,"Organic baby formula is the best choice when you're formula feeding your baby, right? Well, you just never know. It may sound like a great natural alternative to breast milk, but have you looked at all angles? I was unable to breastfeed my daughter and found the whole baby formula adventure quite overwhelming. There are  so many formulas to choose from ! I can remember standing in the baby-food section of the grocery store and not having a clue where to begin. My first instinct was to grab a brand that I knew was popular or at least I was familiar with and to begin with that. There was no way to know if she had any allergies this early on, so I just had to dive in and make that quick decision. No matter how many formula-fed babies grow up to be perfectly fine, there are always downsides to everything, and I was hearing about them all  especially when it came to baby formula. I was compelled to look into a more natural avenue and began researching the organic options. Of course they were said to be the best way to go if breastfeeding was off the table, but low and behold, there was a downside by the name of brown rice syrup.     Melanoma Therapy   Learn About an Advanced   Melanoma Treatment Option Here.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       Manufacturers use brown rice syrup to sweeten the formula as opposed to high fructose corn syrup, which has been getting a bad rap for years. Two and a half years ago when I was looking into the benefits of organic baby formula, there were some skeptics about the use of brown rice syrup, but nothing alarming. Then as of earlier this year, it was brown rice syrup's turn to get some bad press. It came out that this type of syrup contains high levels of arsenic  one scary word to a mom. So, just because it says organic, doesn't necessarily mean it is the best choice. In the end, I went with a store brand of regular old formula. I wasn't convinced that organic was the better way to go, and if I was going to pay the kind of money they were charging, I needed to be certain. My gut told me that there was nothing wrong with baby formula, specifically store-brand formula. More importantly, my daughter liked it and is now a bright, happy, healthy toddler. When I get asked by expecting or new moms about formula I encourage them to do their own research and make their own decisions but to always read the ingredients as well.

The Quad Screen,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/prenatal-testing-quad-screen/,"The quad screen is a blood test that measures the levels of four substances produced by the fetus and passed into the mother's bloodstream: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a protein made by the baby Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) , a hormone created by the placenta Estriol, a form of estrogen produced by the placenta and baby Inhibin A, a hormone made by the placenta In This Series   pregnancy Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT)   pregnancy Amniocentesis   pregnancy Biophysical Profile   pregnancy Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)   pregnancy Glucose Screening and Glucose Tolerance Test   pregnancy Group B Strep Testing During Pregnancy Together they are entered into a formula that tells you what the probability is that you are carrying a child with a chromosomal abnormality  specifically: Neural tube defects:  High levels of AFP may suggest the possibility (but by no means the probability) that a baby is at higher risk. Chromosomal abnormalities:  Low levels of AFP and abnormal levels of the other markers may indicate that the developing baby may be at higher risk for  Down syndrome  and  trisomy 18 . Like all prenatal screenings, the quad screen does not provide a conclusive answer to whether or not your child has a genetic abnormality; it can only tell you whether your risk is more or less than the typical risk at your age. When the quad screen is done Because the quad screen is less accurate than the nuchal translucency (NT)  combined with  first trimester bloodwork , it's typically only recommended for women who are already in their second trimester, around  week 14  to  week 22  of pregnancy. Who the quad screen is for Your doctor may recommend a quad screen instead of  noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) , a much more accurate form of prenatal testing, because NIPT may not be available in your area or may not be covered by your insurance. How it's done A simple blood test is performed. Generally all the blood needed for testing can be drawn with one needle stick. How accurate is the quad screen? When an abnormality exists, the quad screen can detect an increased risk for approximately 85 percent of neural tube defect cases, nearly 80 percent of Down syndrome cases and 80 percent of trisomy 18 cases. But the false positive rate for the independent quad screen is very high: Only one or two out of 50 women with abnormally high readings eventually prove to have an affected fetus. In the other 48 or 49, further testing reveals that there actually is no abnormality after all. Hormone levels may be abnormal because there's more than one fetus, the fetus is either a few weeks older or younger than originally thought, or the results of the test were inaccurate or misinterpreted. Keep in mind that if NIPT is available to you, it also only involves a blood draw, and the results are much more accurate. Risks of quad screening Because the quad screen requires only a blood sample, it's completely safe. The one big risk is that you may get a false positive or a false negative result. If you get an abnormal quad screen result Before you consider taking any action on the basis of prenatal screening, be sure an experienced physician or genetic counselor has evaluated the results. If you're carrying only one fetus and the ultrasound shows  the estimated due date  is correct, your doctor may offer amniocentesis  as a follow-up. Studies indicate that women who receive abnormal results on their quad screen but receive normal results on follow-up testing such as amniocentesis may still be at very slightly increased risk of certain pregnancy complications, such as small-for-gestational-age fetus,  preterm delivery  or  preeclampsia . If you receive results like this, ask your practitioner about whether this might apply to you. Updated 3/3/17"
My Baby’s Weight Had a Huge Effect on How I Parent,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/comments-about-babys-weight-affect-my-parenting.aspx,"I have never been a picky eater. Legend has it that the day I came out of the womb, I asked for escargot and pretty much never looked back. OK, that might be a slight exaggeration. But the truth is, when it comes to food, I am a one size fits all lover. Give me Twinkies and creme brulee in equal measure. I love burgers and lobster and everything in between. I have scorned picky eaters and called them uncultured. When I married my husband, I refused to even listen to his complaints about broccoli and mushrooms and sushi, and gradually he has come to accept (and even love) all three. So as a parent, I had no intention of becoming a short order cook. But then I had my first baby.     Melanoma Therapy   Learn About an Advanced   Melanoma Treatment Option Here.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       My daughter was born at 7 pounds, one ounce. A normal weight for a baby. But when we left the hosptal, she had dipped below six pounds. The nurses and doctors insisted we supplement her with formula until she gained back at least her birth weight. So there I was, a new mom trying to breastfeed, with a baby so small, she could fit in the palms of our hands. I had to take her to be weighed daily for the first month of her life. ""Your baby is so tiny,"" moms of more robust children would exclaim. I started to envy babies with rolls and dimples and wonder why my baby was growing so slowly. We struggled with nursing. By the second week, I was allowed to drop the formula and move to only nursing. But she was, as they say, ""Just not that into me."" Eventually we got into a rhythm. And I stopped having to trudge into the pediatrician for daily weigh-ins. I stopped going to the local maternity store to weigh her before nursing and then again after, just to make sure she was gaining. But the damage was done. My daughter is now nine. She is as picky an eater as they come. She likes her mac and cheese and her chicken fingers, and that's about it. And every time someone makes a comment about her eating, I cringe. It's my personal third rail and biggest inseurity in parenting. I am a short order cook. Just like I always said I'd never be. But when I look at my daughter, all 75th percentile height and weight of her, I can't help but be proud. I got her there. Every inch of her is something I did, I made, I created. So, I am not the mom I thought I would be. And she is not the eater I imagined. You can't plan anything in life, so why on earth did I ever think I could plan how I'd parent? She eats what she eats and I have (almost) made peace with that. 3 RELATED LINKS: Losing the Baby Weight: The Truth About Shedding Pounds After Birth My Baby's Farewell Letter to Her Bottle Weaning From the Bottle"

Folic Acid During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/folic-acid-during-pregnancy/,"By now youve likely read all about the importance of taking your  prenatal vitamin  every day. One of the most important reasons: for the folic acid it contains. Known as folate in food form, this crucial nutrient, a B vitamin (specifically B9) is essential for your body when it comes to your baby's growth and development, particularly in the earliest weeks of pregnancy. Why Do I Need to Take Folic Acid During Pregnancy? Theres no doubt your body works overtime when youre expecting   and it cant make a baby all on its own. It requires plenty of nutrients to baby-build, folic acid being one of the most important of all. Folic acid helps the body break down, use and create protein, the building block of our cells. It also plays a role in DNA creation and the formation of red blood cells. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, folic acid helps the embryonic neural tube   the precursor to  babys brain and spinal cord    to properly close. It also assists in the formation of  babys heart and circulatory system . Because folic acid is water-soluble, your body does not store excess. Instead, it gets passed through your urine. Thats why you absolutely must regularly incorporate this vitamin into your diet. What are the Benefits of Folic Acid? Loads of research has shown that folic acid, especially if its started in the months preceding pregnancy, has important benefits for expecting women and their babies. These include reducing the risk of: Miscarriage ; research has shown that some women have trouble getting or staying pregnant because of folic acid deficiency Neural tube defects, including  spina bifida  and anencephaly, by up to 70 percent Congenital heart defects Gestational diabetes Preterm labor Autism  in your baby How Much Folic Acid Do I Need During Pregnancy? Experts at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) all  recommend pregnant women consume at least 400 mcg of folic acid  every day, ideally beginning at least one month before you start trying to conceive, and ideally 600 mcg a day from all sources, including foods and prenatal vitamins. What Are the Sources of Folic Acid? All prenatal vitamins should contain at least 400 mg of folic acid. Consider it your nutrient backup during pregnancy; it comes in handy especially on days when you feel too sick to eat. So aim to take yours every single day. That said, a supplement simply cant replace a healthy diet. Its vital to eat plenty of folate-rich foods when youre expecting, since theyre also a good source of many other important baby-making nutrients   fiber, calcium and vitamins A and C, to name a few. Some of the best sources of folate in your diet include: Dark leafy greens:  263 mcg in 1 cup cooked spinach Avocado:  120 mcg in 1 cup sliced Legumes : 250 to 350 mcg in 1 cup beans, lentils or peas Broccoli:  168 mcg in 1 cup chopped and cooked Asparagus:  134 mcg in 1/2 cup Beets:  80 mcg in two small Orange:  35 mcg in 3/4 cup Foods fortified with folic acid , including whole grain cereal, bread, pasta and rice RELATED:  8 Folate-Rich Foods   and How to Eat Them! Should I Keep Taking Folic Acid After Baby Is Born? If youre breastfeeding, experts recommend taking a basic daily womens multivitamin that contains 100 percent of the recommended daily value of all nutrients, including folic acid, to support your nutritional needs. You can also choose to continue taking your prenatal vitamin, or you can take a vitamin supplement designed for breastfeeding moms.

Eating Vegetarian and Vegan During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-vegetarian-vegan-during-pregnancy/,"Got a beef with beef (or chicken, fish, eggs ordairy)? There is no reason to worry. You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet even now that youre expecting. Here is what you should know to make sure you and your baby are still getting everything you need. Can I still follow a vegetarian or vegan diet when I'm pregnant? Don't be surprised if you come across well-meaningnaysayers; there are still so many misconceptions about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy. In truth, vegetarians and vegans have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies. Why is there any concern at all? Some of the most vital baby-boosting nutrients are more easily found in meats and other animal-based products. In good news, it's still a cinch to getthem elsewhere. What nutrients will I need to be extra careful to get when I'm pregnant and vegan or vegetarian? Protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D are all nutrients to be mindful of when you're expecting and adhering to your vegetarian or vegan diet. ADVERTISING PROTEIN Why:   Expecting women need more protein than ever  that's because this essential nutrient helps build cells and make hormones for your growing baby. If youre a dairy- and egg-eating vegetarian, you may already get what you need from potent protein sources (craving moreomelets and Greek yogurt now that you're pregnant?). If you're worried you're not getting enough or are a vegan, there are veggie-based proteins that you can add into your diet.  How Much:  75 grams per day Foods to Eat:  Legumes, whole grains, soy and nuts and seeds Split or green peas Chickpeas Black, navy, kidney or pinto beans Quinoa Bulgar, buckwheat and whole wheat couscous Oatmeal Whole-wheat pasta Whole-grain cereals and breads Nut butters Walnuts, cashews, pistachios, almonds, Brazil nuts and pine nuts Soy milk Tofu Miso CALCIUM Why:  Calcium is key for building your babys bones, muscles, heart and nerves, especially during the third trimester. In fact, it's so essential to his development that what he doesn't get from what you eat, he'll take from your bones, potentially putting you at risk of osteoporosis later in life. Luckily, dairy products aren't the only options for getting your daily recommended amounts. Your practitioner may also suggest that you add a calcium supplement for extra insurance. How Much: 1,000 mg per day Foods to Eat : Yogurt Milk Cheese Green leafy vegetables Soy milk Tofu Calcium-fortified orange juice IRON Why:  Your blood volume increases by nearly 50 percent during pregnancy to support you and your developing baby  and iron is required to produce more red blood cells. Not getting enough? Low iron  can result in anemia , which, left untreated, may also lead to preterm labor  and low birth weight. Vegetarians and vegans aren't alone in needing to be conscious of iron levels during pregnancy. Even red-meat eaters have a hard time getting enough from their diets while expecting. One simple way to get what you need is to take an iron supplement, which your practitioner may recommend in addition to your prenatal vitamin after week 20 (or earlier, if routine testing shows your iron stores are low). Its a good idea to also chow down on iron-rich foods. How Much:  About 27 mg Foods to Eat: Beans Edamame Soy products Oat bran Barley Quinoa Bulgur Pumpkin seeds Dried fruit Spinach, collard greens or kale Seaweed VITAMIN B12  Why:  Vitamin B12 partners with folic acid to help with proper fetal brain development; its also important for the formation of red blood cells and for building genetic material. A deficiency has been  linked to neural tube defects  as well as  increased risk of preterm labor . Though B12 deficiencies are rare, vegetarians and particularly vegans often dont get enough of this vitamin, since its found only in foods that come from animals. Ask your practitioner if you need more than what's provided in your prenatal vitamin; she can recommend a supplemental B12  as well as folic acid  and ensure you're not getting too much of a good thing. How Much:  2.6 mcgper day Foods to Eat:  Vitamin B12-fortified soy milk Fortified cereals Nutritional yeast Fortified meat substitutes VITAMIN D Why:  This vital vitamin plays a role in building and maintaining healthy teeth and bones. Severe deficiency  has been linked to  complications including congenital rickets (a condition that causes the bones to become soft and weak, leading to poor growth and skeletal deformities) as well as bone fractures in newborns. The best dietary sources of vitamin D are milk and fish. If neither are part of your diet, a few minutes of sun each day helps your body produce vitamin D  though that can be tough, especially if you have darker skin, live in less-sunny climates, dont get outdoors a lot or wear sunscreen. You can get some vitamin D from fortified soy milk, breads, cereals and OJ, but usually not nearly enough. Fortunately, you can get what you need from a supplement. So ask your practitioner about testing your vitamin D levels and prescribing a supplement as needed.

7 Ways to Improve Your Nutrition When You're Expecting,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/ways-improve-nutrition-when-youre-expecting/,"No two diets are alike, but dont let that get in the way of  healthy nutrition while youre expecting . After all, eating well is one of the best ways to give your baby a head start in life  and it can make your pregnancy go more smoothly, too. Want to know how to consume whats best whether you chow down on the go, know you could make some tweaks to your food habits or pride yourself on the choices you already make? Answer the following questions and get the tasty  and simple  tips that can make a huge difference. What do you eat before you head out in the morning? A cereal bar or yogurt as I bolt out the door.  The good news about those on-the-go options is that they provide fiber and calcium. The not-so-great news: They also typically contain a lot of sugar (and calories). Two healthier solutions that are just as easy to grab: Fill snack bags with bite-sized, unsweetened whole-grain cereal and keep mini containers of low-fat or nonfat Greek yogurt in the fridge. Full of protein, vitamin D, iron and choline, hard-boiled eggs are another great grab-and-go breakfast. A bagel calms my queasy stomach.  Morning sickness can make the morning rush even harder to handle, so it's smart to put something in your belly to ease the quease. But you'll have more energy and give your baby more nutrients if you make that bagel whole wheat or toast up a fiber-rich whole-grain English muffin. Add a dose of protein by spreading it with almond butter. This complex-carb-and-protein combo might do a better job on your queasiness, plus you'll feel fuller longer. A bowl of oatmeal or cereal with fruit, sometimes a scrambled egg.  Kudos for managing to make morning meals a priority  and working in so many good-for-baby food groups. To make the most of your already healthy breakfast, always choose whole-grain cereal, low-fat or nonfat Greek yogurt (it has more protein than regular yogurt), and oatmeal without added sugar. And make sure the eggs are fully cooked now that you're pregnant. What's your a.m. beverage of choice? No doubt about it: coffee.  It's fine to down a cup of joe to start your engine, but do stick to the expert-sanctioned rule of no more than 200 mg (or two cups) of  caffeine  a day. Need more energy? Pair your morning mug with a complex-carb-and-protein combo like whole-wheat toast and cheese. A glass of OJ gives me an energy boost.  OJ contains energy-boosting electrolytes and vitamin C, which helps shore up your immune system and aid iron absorption. Just remember there's a lot of natural sugar in orange juice, so consider swapping it for a whole fiber-rich orange some days. Or add some lower-sugar juices into your daily mix, like a combo of lemon, lime and grapefruit. I go for a tall glass of skim milk.  You're smart to start the day with a glass of milk since you need four servings of dairy daily to build your baby's bones  and protect yours. For a weekend treat, try a fruit smoothie made with skim milk or low-fat yogurt  you'll get your calcium plus fiber and phytonutrients. What do you do when lunchtime rolls around? I make a beeline for the drive-through  its quick!  Fast food is definitely convenient when you're on the run, but most fast-food options just aren't good for you or your baby  too much fat, salt, sugar and calories. Try to limit drive-through days, and when you do go, consider healthier picks like a grilled chicken sandwich or salad (with dressing on the side). One way to cut back on your fast-food habit: Prep tomorrow's lunch the night before, so brown-bagging becomes less of a chore. I zap a frozen meal and eat it at my desk. Frozen meals have come a long way but can still be loaded with fat and salt (and be short on fiber), so read those labels and choose carefully. Try creating your own (much healthier) freezer meals by combining frozen vegetables and pre-cooked shrimp or chicken breast (all available in grocery stores) and making a double-portion stir-fry  one serving for tonight's dinner, the other for tomorrow's lunch. I dig into a homemade sandwich. Bravo for choosing a hearty roll rather than rolling on up to the drive-through. But that sandwich is only as good as its buns and what's between 'em. Always choose whole-grain bread for an extra dose of B vitamins (good for building your baby's nervous system). Take a pass on super-salty cold cuts and high-fat mayo, both of which carry the risk of food-borne illness if the sandwich sits out for a while. Some safer yet still savory options: sliced (homemade or low-sodium) turkey or chicken breast with mustard or hummus or grilled veggies layered with reduced-fat mozzarella. What are you nibbling during your 4:00 slump? Chips or cookies  theyre what I crave and Im allowed some extra calories now.  Yes, you need an extra 300 calories each day to feed your growing baby, but swap that junk for something more nutritious. Try satisfying your afternoon snack attack with a container of fat-free chocolate pudding (and get a little calcium while you do). If salt's what you crave, go for air-popped popcorn sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Im happy with my three-square meals.  Three squares are fine if your energy's not flagging, but you might need a little more steam to power through your day right now. One strategy: Try switching to five or six mini-meals, including a few carb-protein combos like trail mix with nuts or a mini-container of cottage cheese with a spoonful of granola. Smaller, more frequent meals may also help with heartburn. When Im hungry, I reach for fruit, carrot sticks or a granola bar.  Those carrots are full of vitamin A  good for building your baby's eyesight and bones. And fruit is a great source for vitamin C, which helps your body absorb iron  you'll need a lot to generate the blood cells to grow a baby. Maybe toss some dried fruit or soy chips into the mix, both good sources of fiber and iron  and make sure those granola bars aren't loaded with sugar (most are). When you make dinner, which style best describes you? Im the takeout queen.  Too busy to cook most nights? That's okay, but remember: Takeout meals can be high in calories and fat and low on nutrition. A better plan: When you've got some time, cook up a big batch of turkey chili, chicken soup or other easy-to-freeze meals so you control the ingredients. And when you do order in, try to go for lean protein, a solid serving of veggies or salad, and some whole grains, like brown rice. Im a comfort-food cook.  Pregnancy symptoms like nausea and heartburn might make you yearn for comfort food, but those are typically heavy on fat and calories. Look for ways to make your favorite recipes skinnier and more nutritious  try skim milk instead of whole in your mac 'n' cheese and toss in some cauliflower or peas. Use low-fat cheddar in your tuna casserole, and opt for ground turkey instead of beef meatballs when you're in the mood for marinara. Craving something mashed? Swap sweet potatoes for white and skip the butter  add a little orange juice and cinnamon and you're set. Im a health-food lover.  Since you're already a healthy eater, no need to reinvent the dinnertime wheel. Just up your intake of nutrients that are good for your baby, like omega-3 fats found in salmon, sardines and walnuts. More ways to boost your omega-3 intake at any meal: Use extra-virgin olive oil on your sauts and salads, sprinkle flaxseed on your oatmeal and opt for omega-3-enriched eggs. What's your evening snack of choice? I love a bowl of ice cream or cookie.  Treats are fine (and ice cream does have calcium), but a nightly dose of sweets is a surefire way to gain more weight than you should. Instead of that cookie, pop a square of dark chocolate, which contains natural stress-busters to help balance pregnancy-induced mood swings. Another cool snack that'll satisfy a sweet tooth: frozen red grapes  they taste just like candy. I relax with a cup of tea.  The benefits of tea are well known, but when you're expecting, you need to be wary of what's in your cup. Black, green, white and oolong teas all contain anywhere from 26 to 48 mgs of caffeine per eight-ounce cup. As for herbal teas, check in with your ob-gyn or midwife to learn  which are safe . Or steep a little fresh ginger (a tried-and-true morning-sickness soother) and a couple of cloves in a steaming mug of water, then strain them out and sip away. Just a glass of water.  That glass of water is a smart move since you need to up your fluid intake during pregnancy. Drinking water regularly helps relieve symptoms of morning sickness and heartburn as well as constipation. If the need to pee is interfering with your nightly z's, try drinking more during the day and less in the evening. Want to add a hint of flavor and extra nutrients to your H20? Freeze berries in your ice cubes. What foods never make it onto your plate? Fish  ugh!  Lots of people don't dig fish, but seafood can be a great source of protein and iron, important nutrients for your growing bundle. Plus, the omega-3 fatty acids in salmon and halibut can promote your baby's brain development. But some types of seafood (shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish) may contain high levels of mercury and  should be avoided , especially by expectant moms. The bottom (fishing) line: Try to get fish on your menu at least a couple of times a month  even canned (or pouched) light tuna counts. Vegetables  meat and pasta are what I crave.  While meat and grains can raise your stores of zinc, iron and folate, both you and your baby will miss out on a bevy of vitamins if you always skip the veggies. You really should eat three to four servings daily (beans count), so try to find ways to up your intake. Toss a salad with chopped carrots, black beans, spinach and roasted red peppers. Use whole grains like couscous and quinoa as a nutrient-rich base for any vegetables you like, whether raw, steamed, sauted or roasted. Meat  Im a vegan. You don't have to be a meat eater  to be a healthy mother-to-be, but you do need to make sure you're getting those extra calories, protein, vitamins and minerals from other food sources like nuts, beans and soy products. (Greens, potatoes, pasta and corn are also protein providers.) Meat-free sources of iron include whole grains, dried beans, dark-green leafy vegetables and dried fruits. Be sure to include foods rich in vitamin C in your diet every day, which will help your body absorb iron.

That Article Saying Prenatal Vitamins Are Unnecessary Is a Total Scam,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0713/that-article-saying-prenatal-vitamins-are-harmful-is-a-total-scam,"By now youve probably seen the British article questioning whether prenatal vitamins are really necessary with some media even insinuating the supplements are a scam (ahem,  New York  Magazine ). Dont listen. To be clear, this paper is just a review, not a study. In other words, its an opinion piece. And the advice it offers, experts say, can be potentially dangerous. As medical practitioners will tell you, there are a number of nutrients women need during pregnancy, and Americans are deficient in many of them. Not getting enough while youre expecting can have devastating effects for both mom and baby.             Save Now On Alive!    Get Your Coupon For Any Alive! Multi-Vitamin   FeelAlive.com         I dont agree that prenatals are a thing of past, says Scott Sullivan, MD, the director of maternal-fetal medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). We have good data on a lot of these nutrients, so its premature to say we should just abandon prenatal vitamins. The  review , published in the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin , looked at past research to determine whether taking folic acid, iron, and vitamins A, C, D and E during pregnancy reduced the risks of complications including preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight or stillbirth. READ ALSO:  Choosing the Best Prenatal Vitamin The authors concluded that British women only need to take two supplements: 400 mcg of  folic acid  (before and up through 12 weeks of pregnancy), and  vitamin D  (which they said appeared to beneficial, though not as clear cut as folic acid). They added that much evidence for taking supplementation in pregnancy comes from studies done in low-income countries,where women are more likely to be malnourished. But there are several other nutrients ACOG recommends in a supplement for good reason. Here's the truth behind prenatal vitaims and exactly why you and your baby need them. Calcium:  ACOG recommends all women, not just pregnant women, get at least 1000 mg of calcium of day. But  calcium is especially important during pregnancy , since what you consume helps build babys teeth and skeleton. If youre not getting enough in your diet, baby will take it from your bones one reason why women whove been pregnant are at higher risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D, in turn, works with calcium to help support the demands of pregnancy. Without enough, your body cant process the calcium you need. Iron:   Anemia is very common in pregnancy , Sullivan notes. ""Thirty to 40 percent of my patients are iron deficient, he says. Being anemic can make you feel even more sick than pregnancy already does, plus put you at risk of a blood transfusion during delivery and complications in future pregnancies. Its very hard to be sure youre getting enough, which is why ACOG  recommends supplementing , Sullivan says. READ ALSO:  Your Prenatal Diet: An Infographic Iodine:  A quarter of American women are  deficient in iodine , says Sullivan, because people are eating less table salt and seafood, the nutrients two major sources. If you dont get enough iodine when youre expecting, it puts baby at risk for neurodevelopmental issues. Most women need a supplement of about 120 to 150 mcg. About half of all American prenatals currently contain iodine, Sullivan says, but all will in about two years. Two more  nutrients that are wise to get from your prenatal are vitamin B6  (which can help curb morning sickness) and  omega 3  (which helps build babys brain). Because there are so many of these recommended nutrients, a prenatal vitamin should be a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than taking a bunch of individual supplements. Sure, there are pricey ones out there, but they're not always the best, and some really good ones are cheap, Sullivan says. Still skeptical? Talk to your doctor about your diet and individual nutritional needs. What you eat is vitally important, and you cant get everything you need from a supplement, either. But your doctor will almost definitely recommend taking one anyway. Ask his or her advice to find the best, most cost-effective option. Some people need B12 supplements, some are people very low in vitamin D, some people have anemia,"" Sullivan says. ""All of which makes supplementing more complex than [the authors] would make it appear."

But in very few cases, babies arrive into the world still inside their amniotic saca rare glimpse into life inside the womb, as is depicted in a now-viral anonymous photo shared  by the Empowered Birth Project . Known medically as an  en caul  birth, this type of delivery is completely safe. Experts say it almost never happens in a vaginal delivery, and it very rarely happens in C-sections since the scalpel usually pierces the amniotic sac when the uterus is cut open.     Melanoma Therapy   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       So how can this happen? During pregnancy, the amniotic sac along with the  mucous plug  protect baby from the outside world, and in rare instances, the sac remains intact after delivery. Until its punctured, the baby continues to receive nutrients via the umbilical cord and  the placenta  and breathes amniotic fluid. Within seconds of birth, the doctor ruptures the sac, and the baby begins to breathe oxygen for the first time. A viral video from earlier this year revealed what this process looks like. Sometimes a doctor wont manually rupture the sac before birth because delivery happened so fast he or she didnt notice the sac was intact. Or doctors may leave it intact even if they do notice because theres really no harm in delivering baby this way. In fact, en caul births are more common among premature babies, and some research has shown that among those who are extremely early, it may actually have benefits. What an incredible reminder of just how much work your body does to grow, nourish and sustain life!"
Is It Implantation Bleeding — Or Just My Period?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/preconception/implantation-bleeding/,"When youre actively trying to get pregnant, those two weeks between ovulation and a positive pregnancy test (or a menstrual cycle) can seem much longer. If youre like most women, youll spend them hyper-aware of every ache, twinge, yawn and craving your body has, wondering whether its a sign of pregnancy. One of the most telltale signs you might be looking for is bleeding. If you do have some light spotting, does it mean anything? While it can be hard to tell, many women who go on to have healthy, normal pregnancies have whats called implantation bleeding around the time that their embryo lodges itself into the side of the uterus. What is implantation bleeding? At the moment  an egg is successfully fertilized by a sperm , the embryo starts dividing and growing, sending out signals to a womans body to prepare for pregnancy. In turn, the walls of the uterus, called the endometrium, start to change: Theyve already been thickening throughout the menstrual cycle, but theyll need to grow and mature even more to protect and nourish an embryo for nine months. Anywhere from six to 12 days after fertilization, the quickly-growing embryo has moved down the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. Its starting to need more nutrients, and the endometrium has filled in enough to support the embryo. At this time, the embryo attaches itself to the endometrium, where it becomes reliant on a mothers body  for the first time  for nutrients and oxygen. ADVERTISING When does implantation bleeding occur? When the embryo implants in the uterus, it can disrupt tiny blood vessels in the spot that it attaches. This wont cause any problems (the endometrium recovers!) but some women will experience light bleeding, from pink to red to  brown discharge . Such so-called implantation bleeding will likely arrive earlier than your expected monthly flow (usually around five to ten days after conception). How do I know its implantation bleeding and not my period? Since implantation bleeding often occurs before you test positive on a pregnancy test, it can be hard to know whether light bleeding is  an early sign of pregnancy  or just normal spotting leading up to your period. And unfortunately, theres no conclusive test or symptom that will tell you. The best way to know whether youre pregnant or not is to wait a few more days and take a pregnancy test. The timing of your last intercourse might also help you figure it out: If its been more than two weeks, its unlikely that any bleeding is due to implantation. That being said, the approximately one-third of women who report having experienced implantation bleeding often report that its distinct from their usual premenstrual spotting  some say the blood is darker and not as red compared with normal period blood. Others have mild cramping at the same time as the spotting. But for many women, the two types of bleeding arent different at all. So youre not alone if you assume that some spotting is implantation bleeding and get your period a few days later, or if you assume that its normal spotting and end up being pregnant! When should I see my doctor? Light bleeding during pregnancy   even at times other than implantation  is often normal. Causes can include mundane things like irritation of the cervix following a pelvic exam or sex or infection of the vagina. But because sometimes bleeding following a positive pregnancy test can be a sign of  ectopic pregnancy ,  molar pregnancy  or  miscarriage , you should always call your medical provider if you experience bleeding so you can talk through any other symptoms. Dont worry too much; chances are good that if the bleeding is light and does not last long, everything is fine.

The Surprising Little Nutrient That Might Help You Conceive [STUDY],http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/preconception/the-surprising-little-nutrient-that-might-help-you-conceive--study-.aspx,"Summary: Getting enough of the trace mineral selenium could improve your odds of becoming pregnant, suggests a new Australian study. Since this is most commonly found in meat, if you're vegetarian or vegan you might want to take extra care to make sure you're hitting your daily quota. Trying to conceive?  Certain foods  can help increase your chances for becoming pregnant. Dairy products and complex carbs appear to promote regular ovulation, while the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables could boost fertility. But that's not all. Now, experts suspect there's another nutrient that might make a difference, too. Higher levels of the mineral selenium may boost a woman's likelihood for becoming pregnant, according to a  new Australian study . When researchers looked at the ovary cells of women undergoing in vitro fertilization, they found that women whose cells had elevated levels of selenium were more likely to become pregnant. The trace mineral, which acts as a detoxifying antioxidant, may play a role in helping to create a healthier environment for a woman's eggs.             Psoriasis Treatment    Learn About a Treatment Option for Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis   www.informationaboutpsoriasis.com         Women of childbearing age need  55 micrograms of the nutrient  per day (FYI, the number jumps to 60 mcg during pregnancy and 70 mcg if you're breastfeeding), and most Americans are getting their fill. You can get a day's worth of selenium (or close to it) from a serving of fish or meat like halibut, ham, shrimp, beef or turkey.

How Much Weight You Should Gain During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/weight-gain/,"If  weight  and  gain  have always been unspeakable words to you, added pounds are about to be a plus: You're pregnant, and that means you're  supposed  to gain weight. That said, its important to know how much to gain and when to gain it. Pack on way too many pounds and you increase your chances of gestational diabetes , hypertension and complications during labor and delivery (not to mention youll more likely find yourself with stretch marks plus extra pounds to shed once you've delivered). In fact, a government report from November 2015 found that 47 percent of American moms gained more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy, putting themselves and their babies at risk for health problems both during and after pregnancy. Pack on too few , as about one in five moms do,and you're at an increased risk for  a baby who's born too soon  or too small (or both) along with other pregnancy complications. Bottom line: A steady pace is best for you, your body, your pregnancy and, most of all, your baby. While all of this may sound overwhelming, in most cases theres a lot you can do to keep your weight gain under control (plus, of course, your doctor will be there to guide you). Heres some important info to keep in mind to gain a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy. MORE IN THIS ARTICLE: Understanding Your BMI How Much Weight to Gain and When Where's the Weight Going? Weighing Yourself How Many Calories Should You Eat? Weight Gain Red Flags Will the Weight Ever Come Off? Understanding Your BMI You may have heard the often-repeated 25 to 35 pounds as the suggested weight gain goal range for women during their pregnancy, but thats directed at women whose Body Mass Index, or BMI, falls into the normal weightcategory . Your BMI is calculated by your height and weight. The first step to determining your weight gain goal is to  determine your BMI . How Much Weight to Gain and When Unlike the equation used to calculate your BMI, the process of putting on pounds is not an exact science. Your rate of weight gain will depend on a variety of factors, such as your metabolism, your activity level and your genetics  just another reason why its important to keep up your doctor appointments throughout your pregnancy. That said, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) offers general weight gain guidelines based on various BMI ranges (see chart below). These vary by trimester: During your first trimester , your baby is still tiny, which means you dont need to gain more than a total of three to four pounds. However if you're suffering from  morning sickness , you might not gain an ounce (or might even lose a little). Thats OK, as long as your appetite picks up and you make up for those pounds in the second trimester. In your second trimester , your baby starts to grow in earnest. Your weight gain should pick up so that, if you started out pregnancy at a normal weight, youd gain a total of about 14 pounds. In your third trimester,   babys weight gain will pick up steam, but yours may start to taper off for a net gain of about 10 pounds. Some women find their weight holds steady or even drops a pound or two during the ninth month, when ever-tighter abdominal quarters can make finding room for food a struggle. Gradual weight gain is as important as the number of pounds you gain, since your baby needs a steady supply of nutrients and calories to grow during his or her stay in the womb. The amount of weight you should gain each week in trimesters two and three differs depending on your BMI: Recommended Weight Gain According to ACOG  Pre-pregnancy Weight   Category  Body Mass Index  Recommended   Range of   Total Weight (pounds)   Recommended Rates   of Weight Gain in the   Second and Third   Trimesters (pounds)   (Mean Range [lb/wk])  Underweight Less than 18.5 2840 1 (1-1.3) Normal Weight 18.524.9 2535 1 (0.8-1) Overweight 2529.9 1525 0.6 (0.5-0.7) Obese 30 and greater 1120 0.5 (0.4-0.6) If you're carrying twins (and eating for three),  the weight gain recommendations  for women of an average weight is 37 to 54 pounds. Overweight women should gain 31 to 50 pounds, and obese women should gain 25 to 42 pounds. How closely will you be able to follow this formula? Realistically, not that closely. There will be weeks when your self-control will waver and itll be a rocky road (by the half gallon) to your weight gain total. And there will be weeks when eating will seem too much of an effort. Try not to stress over the scale. As long as your overall gain is on target and your rate averages out to the above, youre right on track. Where's the Weight Going? Ever wonder how your pregnancy weight is distributed in your body? It may feel like its all in your belly, but thats not actually the case. For a 30-pound weight gain, heres the average breakdown: Baby:  7.5 pounds Placenta:  1.5 pounds Amniotic fluid:  2 pounds Uterine enlargement:  2 pounds Maternal breast tissue:  2 pounds Maternal blood volume:  4 pounds Fluids in maternal tissue:  4 pounds Maternal fat stores:   7 pounds You need weight in all these areas in order to have a healthy baby and to get your body ready for motherhood (including preparing your body for nursing). Weighing Yourself For best weight gain results, keep your eye on the scale, since what you dont know can throw your weight way off-target. Weigh yourself: At the same time of day Wearing the same amount of clothes (or none at all) On the same scale Once a week (more often and youll drive yourself crazy with day-to-day fluid fluctuations; if your scale-phobic, twice a month should do the trick) Waiting until your monthly prenatal checkup to check your weight is fine, too  though keep in mind that a lot can happen in a month (as in 10 pounds) or not happen (as in no pounds), making it harder for you to stay on track. How Many Calories Should You Eat? The key to healthy pregnancy weight gain is eating a well-balanced  pregnancy diet . That means some not-so-fun news: The expression eating for two is a myth  or at least an exaggeration. (Sorry!) Instead of doubling  your caloric intake , you likely won't need any more calories in the first trimester. In the second trimester you should add about an additional 300 calories per day, and in the final trimester of your pregnancy you'll need close to 500 calories more per day than you were eating before you conceived. As a rule, instead of just eating  more , focus on eating nutrient-rich  foods that will give you energy , help keep morning sickness at bay and fuel all of the incredible fetal development going on inside of you, from  fetal bone growth  to  cognitive development  to the formation of your babys  skin ,  eyes  and  digestive system . Keep in mind, too, that if you have a fast metabolism are very physically active or are carrying multiples, you may gain weight more slowly and will need to eat more calories. And if you were  overweight or obese  before you got pregnant, you may not need as many calories. As always, it's important to check with your practitioner to get a personalized recommendation on your caloric and weight gain goals. Weight Gain Red Flags If you gain more than three pounds in any one week in the second trimester, or if you gain more than two pounds in any week in the third trimester  especially if it doesnt seem to be related to overeating or excessive intake of sodium  check with your practitioner, as it could be a  symptom of preeclampsia . Check, too, if you gain no weight for more than two weeks in a row during the fourth to eighth months. Will All That Weight Ever Come Off? Many women fear that they wont be able to  lose the weight they gain during pregnancy once baby is born , but theres no need to stress about it. There are lots of healthy ways to lose weight after pregnancy  and many of them are also great ways to meet other new moms (like stroller walking groups or baby-and-me yoga classes). Many gyms offer childcare for babies as young as 3 months old, which is a great way for you to boost endorphins and get a break from your little one  both of which can help keep the baby blues at bay. On top of that, many women are shocked at how quickly they are able to lose the pounds by  breastfeeding  alone (women who breastfeed for even a few months tend to lose weight faster than those moms who dont at all). Just remember, gaining the right amount of weight (and not too much) during pregnancy makes it a whole lot easier to shed the pounds once baby arrives.

What You Eat Now Might Impact How Long You Breastfeed Later,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0302/what-you-eat-now-might-impact-breastfeeding-duration,"You already know that  eating a balanced diet  is one of the best steps you can take every day to have a healthy pregnancy. Choosing nutrient-rich foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, lowfat dairy, nuts, seeds and lean protein nourish both you and your baby. But new research looks more specifically at why certain foods help and possibly harm the body by exploring how dietary inflammation impacts pregnancy outcomes like birth weight and breastfeeding duration. Whats dietary inflammation anyway? Inflammation happens when the bodys immune system reacts to what it considers a foreign object in the body. That can be a good thing sometimes: For example, when you scrape your knee, the redness around the cut is your immune system working to protect you from infection-causing foreign bacteria. Dietary inflammation, on the other hand, is not so good for you. It happens when certain foods cause the immune system to work overtime. While we know that chronic dietary inflammation has been linked to health conditions including heart disease, arthritis, cancer and dementia, researchers have only recently looked at its impact on expectant moms and their babies.        Get Info on an FDA Approved Treatment      What the study found In a new study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital (BWH) in Boston followed 1,808 mom-child pairs to see how diet impacts the health of both mom and baby. Women in their first and second trimesters filled out food questionnaires that were compared to a dietary inflammation index. Researchers then looked for known markers of inflammation in the body by testing women for certain proteins that the liver produces when inflammation is present. The study found that obese women with signs of inflammation in the body were more likely to have low birth weight babies. And lean women with signs of inflammation were more likely to have difficulty breastfeeding, which led them to stop after just a month. In this study, diet was not associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, C-section births or preterm births. According to Sarbattama Sen, M.D., study author and a neonatologist in BWHs Department of Pediatric Newborn Medicine, some animal studies have shown that diet may actually impact breast milk production, but were far from proving this to be true in humans. In other words, weve only just begun to look at the role of inflammation on pregnancy health, and more investigation needs to be done. Study caveats Lean women may have had more difficulty breastfeeding than overweight and obese women in this study because they were more likely to initiate breastfeeding in the first place. Additionally, Dr. Sen contends that inflammation may not have been associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia because researchers tested women in the second trimester, before the conditions were present in the body. Lastly, because women were asked to self-report their diets, they may have under- or over-reported certain foods. What this means to you Weve got a long way to go before we know the true impact of dietary inflammation on pregnancy health. Fortunately, foods that fight inflammation, like fish, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, also happen to be part of a healthy diet  which reinforces the importance of eating the foods weve long known are good for mom and baby. Here are other helpful tips to a healthy pregnancy diet: Think lean.  Protein is essential to building a baby, so  choose lean options  like chicken, fish, dairy, tofu and legumes. Get your vitamin C.   Vitamin C rich foods  like kiwi, mango, strawberries and citrus fruits help boost your babys growth and development. Keep it varied.  Eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables is key to stocking up on important nutrients like vitamin E, riboflavin, folic acid, magnesium and beta-carotene, which are crucial to babys growth. Go whole.  Whole grains found in breads, cereals and pasta are essential to babys development  plus they fight constipation and nausea. Get ample iron.  Iron is so important to babys brain development, so  ensure youre getting enough  red meat, green leafy veggies, lentils, dried fruit and blackstrap molasses. Dont skimp on the healthy fats.   Healthy fats  found in avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil and fatty fish are essential to  brain  and  eye development . Got milk?   Calcium-rich foods  like dairy (or dairy alternatives), calcium-fortified juices and green leafy vegetables help with babys bone growth. It also helps keep your bones strong  since if youre not getting enough in your diet, your body will take what it needs for baby from your own bones. 3 things to read next: Pregnancy Nutrition 101: An Infographic The Cost of Feeding a Family of Four a Healthy Diet Gestational Diabetes Diet Regulations and Menu Plan"
Vitamin K Injection in Newborns,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vitamin-k-injection.aspx,"What is a vitamin K shot?  A single injection of vitamin K containing .5 to 1 milligram of the nutrient is given in one of your babys thighs. In This Series   Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening   Eye Ointment for Newborns   first year Newborn Hearing Screening Tests   Hepatitis B Vaccine   The Heel-Stick Test   pregnancy Your Babys Apgar Tests When is it done?  Newborns will get a vitamin K shot usually within the first six hours of birth  and certainly by the time they leave the hospital. Why do babies need vitamin K?  Vitamin K is necessary for the blood to clot. All babies have low levels of K when theyre born, so the shot reduces the chances of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), which happens in a small percentage of babies. Newborns who have VKDB may have blood in their  stool  or urine, or they may ooze blood from the skin around the  umbilical cord . The bleeding can be fatal. Babies are at higher risk of VKDB if they dont get the shot, if theyre exclusively  breastfed  (because cows milk formula contains more vitamin K than human milk), or if their mothers take antiseizure medications. The condition is most common in the first days of life, but it can also appear after two weeks. Is it standard?  Yes, receiving the vitamin K shot is common practice for all babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first started recommending it in 1961. Should you ask for it?  You wont have to. Are vitamin K shots safe?  The vitamin K shot is safe, even though in the early 1990s, British researchers published data that found an association between vitamin K injections in newborns and childhood leukemia. But since then, many scientists have looked at the same data as well as additional research and found no link. The AAP has also analyzed the British data, plus research on children in the US, and found no association between the shot and childhood leukemia or other cancers. The AAP has also stated that recent studies on how childhood leukemia develops show that its unlikely vitamin K injections have anything to do with it. Can you ask for vitamin K as an oral dose instead of as a shot for your newborn?  There are oral doses of vitamin K, but they arent as effective at preventing the VKDB that can develop after the first few days of your babys life. Because an oral dose of K can't protect babies against later-stage VKDB (which can happen anytime between the age of two weeks and six months) as well as the shot can, it's typically not an option for newborns in the United States."
Are You Drinking Enough Water During Pregnancy?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/drink-enough-water/,"Is being pregnant driving you to drink? Well, it should  at least all the way to the water faucet. As a mom-to-be, its essential to be doubly sure that you're drinking enough water. Heres what you need to know about drinking water during pregnancy, from the benefits (preventing hemorrhoids and other pregnancy symptoms), to how much you need (more than before), to how to ensure your water is safe (more important than ever). Water delivers essentials to your fetus Ever wonder how all the good stuff in the prenatal vitamins and healthy foods you're faithfully consuming every day are shipped to your fetus? It all starts with water, which helps your body absorb essential nutrients into the cells and transports vitamins, minerals and hormones to the blood cells. It's those nutrient-rich blood cells that reach the placenta and ultimately your baby  all with the help of H 2 O. Your recommended daily water intake is higher during pregnancy To that end, youll need more water to keep your system running for two during pregnancy. The Institute of Medicine says pregnant women in temperate climates should aim to drink 12 or 13 glasses (they count a glass as eight ounces) each day, which is slightly more than the amount for non-pregnant women (around 11 glasses each day). Try to space out your sips to keep them coming steadily throughout the day rather than gulping a lot at once, which could leave you feeling uncomfortably full. Since most of us dont drink enough fluids, filling a water bottle or two every morning and keeping it handy all day takes the hassle out of hydration. Be sure to sip before, during and after you work out, or if you find yourself outside on a hot day. Note, too, that if you feel thirsty, its a sign that your body is already on its way to being dehydrated. ADVERTISING How can you tell if you're getting enough? If your trips to the bathroom are frequent and your urine is pale or colorless, you're drinking is on track. Water can help prevent UTIs, constipation and hemorrhoids Now that you're pregnant, you're not just  eating and drinking for two   you're also excreting for two (ew, but true). That means you'll have more trash to take out of your system than ever before. Enter water, which dissolves the waste products and helps flush them from the kidneys. Drinking enough water also keeps your urine diluted, which not only keeps things flowing but also  keeps UTIs at bay  (urine that hangs out too long in your bladder can become a breeding ground for infection-triggering bacteria), as well as bladder infections and kidney infections (which are are types of UTIs). A copious consumption of water also helps immeasurably in the poop department, helping to move solid wastes more speedily down the digestive path. And, since  constipation is pretty common in pregnant women   not to mention the fact that constipation pressure can cause  hemorrhoids   well...bottoms up! (Couldnt help it!) Water can help with fatigue, headaches, swelling and overheating Is it crazy-hot in here  or are you pregnant? Its true, the heat is on (high!) when you're expecting. But if you drink water during pregnancy, you can keep the body's cooling system running smoothly  even when your inner thermostat is cranked all the way up  by dispersing excess heat  in the form of sweat . An ample flow of fluids also keeps   pregnancy fatigue  in check  one of the first symptoms of dehydration is exhaustion  and can keep  headaches  at bay (another dehydration symptom). It also helps your body get rid of excess sodium among other things, minimizing swelling particularly  swollen feet or ankles  (your doctor might call it edema). Ensuring your waters safe Its never a bad idea to assess the cleanliness of your drinking water  and thats especially true when youre pregnant. While most of the water you drink likely comes from public water systems and is generally safe todrink, it can be contaminated withhigh levels of chemicals that could harm a fetus, including lead,mercury and arsenic. In addition, there is increasing evidence that BPA (an industrial chemical that mimics estrogen and is found in some plastics) can be problematic when you're expecting. Learn more on how to  ensure your water supply is safe to drink when you're pregnant . Water isnt the only way to hydrate Water is the best drink around, but if youre all watered out? There are plenty of other liquids that make the cut: Milk (an 8-ounce glass of skim yields just over seven ounces of water), sparkling or flavored waters, fruit and vegetable juices (watch out for added sugar in fruit juice and added sodium in veggie drinks) and decaffeinated teas are all great choices  just be sure you keep an eye on pasteurization, calorie info and all that. You should, however, limit your intake of soda (nothing but empty calories), as well as other beverages containing caffeine, since they have a diuretic effect (besides the other reasons to cut the   caffeine during pregnancy ). Keep in mind, too, that about 20 percent of our daily water intake comes from food sources. Fruits pack the most water: One cup of watermelon or cantaloupe provides just under five ounces of water; a medium-size pear or one cup of strawberries provides about four and a half ounces; a medium size orange has four ounces. Got the sniffles? A cup of chicken soup yields roughly six ounces of water.

Experts Say Raw Eggs May Be Safe for Pregnant Women in the UK to Eat—But What About in the U.S.?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/experts-say-raw-eggs-safe-for-pregnancy-in-UK-what-about-the-US,"Yesterday, a report from a branch of the UK government announced a particular type of eggs are safe for women to eat raw during pregnancy, a controversial move as it directly contradicts a basic pregnancy guideline that the same group supported just 15 years ago. Most experts would advise against  eating raw eggs if you're pregnant because theres a risk that uncooked eggs are contaminated with the bacteria salmonella. When most people are exposed to salmonella, they only have typical not-so-fun symptoms of food-borne illness (vomiting, diarrhea, etc.). But for any case, there is a small risk of sepsis, which can result in serious complications for expecting women, whose immune systems are compromised. The group behind this announcement isthe Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food, which advises the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the British version of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In its last report in 2001, the committee agreed that eating raw eggs, eggs with runny yolks or any food that is uncooked or only lightly cooked may cause food poisoning in expecting women. But in the past 15 years, the safety standards of egg producers have changed drastically enough to reduce the chance of infection for people most at risk. That's why the newly-released report describes a VERY LOW risk level"" of salmonella contamination from eggs produced under certain regulations and states these eggs can be served ""raw or lightly cooked"" even to people most ""vulnerable to infection,"" such as ""pregnant women, the young and the elderly."" This applies both at home and in restaurants. Before you start downing your eggs sunny-side up, though, know that the FSA, which this group advises, has not yet changed its guidelines for pregnant women - even though it has started a two-month investigation into the recommendations to determine if the groups guidelines should be updated. Any changes it might  make will be due to the British Lion Code of Practice , created in 1998, which requires animals be vaccinated against salmonella and other hygienic procedures to keep eggs from coming into contact with bird feces. The Lion Code also enforces an independent audit to test chickens for the bacteria, a tracking system and higher animal welfare standards (including more space for chickens to rangea  notoriously controversial issue in the U.S.  that has so far only  been addressed by California law ). Not all eggs sold in the U.K., however, are subject to these standards. And the group notes that outbreaks and cases of salmonella infection in people are predominantly associated with non-UK eggs. So what about in the U.S? According to the FDA website , there are  regulations in place to help prevent contamination of eggs on the farm and during shipping and storage, and consumers also play a key role in preventing illness linked to eggs. But the program isnt as intense as in the U.K. For one, chickens arent vaccinated against salmonella, and because eggs are so widely eaten in the U.S., making such changes could be pricey, says Allison Bryant Mantha, M.D., an OB-GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital. Until the U.K.s Lion Code has been proven as both effective and cost-friendly, its unlikely a similar program would be adopted in the U.S.  which means itll be a while before raw eggs are on the menu for expecting moms in the U.S., if ever. Whats more, she explains, raw or undercooked eggs also carry a risk of listeriosis infection ( a bacteria  most commonly associated with raw milk and cheese, which can live in food processing plants), which is dangerous for pregnant women. So for now, she says, ACOG continues to recommend that expecting women dont eat raw or undercooked eggs in the U.S. Bottom line: There are lots of pregnancy-friendly nutrients in well-cooked eggs  like  DHA  and choline, which are great for  babys developing brain . So keep on swapping those sunny-side up eggs for a scramble."

Half of Breastfeeding Moms Not Giving Babies Important Vitamin D Supplement,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/breastfeeding-moms-not-giving-babies-vitamin-d-study/,"Breast milk is natures ideal food -- but it doesnt offer enough of the vitamin D babies need to support their rapidly growing bones. Thats why doctors recommend  giving breastfed babies  400 IUs of a liquid vitamin D every day. However a new study finds that only about one in two  breastfeeding  moms may be offering their babies this important supplement. That amounts to half of breastfed infants who may not be getting the vitamins they need. What the study found Researchers at the Mayo Clinic surveyed a total of 184 moms, 140 who exclusively breastfed and 44 who  supplemented with formula . Only 55 percent of nursing moms gave their babies the recommended vitamin D supplement, and just 42 percent gave their babies the full 400 IUs. The study, published in the journal  Annals of Family Medicine,  found that a full 88 percent of moms in the study said theyd rather pop a pill themselves than give a vitamin to their babies. Many cited safety as the most important consideration in choosing how to ensure their infants were getting the recommended amount of vitamin D. What moms should know Babies need 400 IUs of vitamin D in their diets every day to avoid preventable and potentially serious health complications. Severe deficiency can lead to rickets (soft bones), seizures due to low calcium, and even heart failure in infants, explains Tom Thacher, MD, a professor of family medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study.     Save Now On Alive!   Get Your Coupon For Any   Alive! Multi-Vitamin   FeelAlive.com       Babies can, however, reap the benefits if Mom takes a vitamin D supplement herself -- but only if the dose is high enough. The authors note that one of the advantages of the mother taking the vitamin is that its slightly easier for an adult to pop a pill than it is to administer a dropper of medicine (even if it does taste yummy) to baby. Whats more, taking a pill helps avoid  baby dosing errors  (which are more common than you might think but easily avoidable if you carefully follow the instructions on the bottle). Many moms continue to  take a prenatal vitamin  after birth, but they contain just 600 IUs of D -- not nearly enough to cover both Mom and baby. And no more than 10 percent of the daily dose a mother takes is found in a liter of her breast milk, explains Thacher. If a mother takes 4000 IU per day, her breast milk will typically contain approximately 400 IU in one liter, or 32 ounces, says Thacher. But newborns do not consistently consume up to one liter per day until they reach the age of 3 months, so moms may take doses up to 6000 IU per day in order to meet the infants recommended intake. The authors conclude that taking an additional daily supplement of 6000 IUs of vitamin D for the first three months of babys life on top of whats already in a prenatal vitamin would be a safe and effective way for breastfeeding moms to cover their babies needs through breast milk. After the third month, when babys eating more, you could drop down to 4000 IUs per day. What you can do If youd like to skip the vitamin D supplement for your breastfeeding baby, talk to your doctor about taking it yourself. He or she can help you determine if its the right choice for both of you, as well as the advise you on the exact dose you should take."
Vitamin D Deficiency During Pregnancy May Be Linked to MS Diagnosis for Child,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0308/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-pregnancy-may-increase-ms-risk-in-kid,"You may have already heard about the reported benefits of getting enough vitamin D during pregnancy,which include everything from  reduced risk of severe preeclampsia and preterm birth for you, to  stronger muscles and  lower allergy risk later of life in your child. And since getting plenty of vitamin D has already been  associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis  (MS) in adulthood, experts also began to wonder if exposure to  vitamin D  in utero might have the same protective effect on a childs risk of MS later in life. Now a new studyfrom Harvards School of Public Health, published online this week in the journal  JAMA Neurology , suggests that children of moms with vitamin D deficiency during early pregnancy may be at greater risk of developing MS in adulthood. What the study found The researchers looked at over 175 people with a diagnosis of MS whose mothers were part of an earlier study in Finland and compared them with a control group of those without MS. The scientists then looked at blood samples from these individuals mothers that had been collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. According to the results, the risk of MS was significantly higher in children whose moms were deficient in vitamin D compared with the children of moms whose vitamin D levels were adequate.

That said, many people simply aren't able to produce enough  including those with dark skin, who live in less sunny climates and who have lighter skin that needs to be protected with sunscreen. So, that's most of us! You can get some vitamin D from your diet, butit unfortuantely isn't found in many foods. That's why many doctors recommend vitamin D supplementation (which you should already be getting from your prenatal vitamin!). Limitations of this study These findings seem to point to an obvious fix: Ensure all expectant moms are getting enough vitamin D. But before you jump to the conclusion that this vitamin will protect all babies from a future diagnosis of MS, it's important to understand the study's limitations. First, the level of vitamin D measured in an expecting womans blood is not a direct measure of the vitamin D levels that her baby is exposed to in utero. Second, this study only shows an association between a maternal deficiency in vitamin D during pregnancy and MS in offspring. And that doesnt actually prove that getting enough vitamin D during pregnancy protects a baby from a future MS diagnosis. Finally, some experts point out that the study didnt account for any other variables (such as moms BMI; smoking and other lifestyle habits; sun exposure; activity level; or family history of MS). Plus their statistical accounting was a little arbitrary (meaning if the data were interpreted using a different yet equally valid statistical method, the results would looks vastly different)  making the association between vitamin D levels and MS less clear than the study makes it sound. What this means for you While no amount of any food can come close to the recommended daily intake, it's still important to consume as much of these healthy sources of vitamin D in your diet as possible (all are also chock fully of other  pregnancy-friendly nutrients ): Fortified milk, cereal and juices Sardines Egg yolks Low-mercury fatty fish, like salmon Mushrooms That said, the only practical way to consume enough vitamin D is through supplements  one moreexcellent reason to make sure youre taking a  prenatal supplement  containing this vital vitamin daily. 3 things to read next: Foods high in vitamin D Choosing a prenatal vitamin Nutrients that make a baby"

That Article Saying Prenatal Vitamins Are Unnecessary Is a Total Scam,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0713/that-article-saying-prenatal-vitamins-are-harmful-is-a-total-scam,"By now youve probably seen the British article questioning whether prenatal vitamins are really necessary with some media even insinuating the supplements are a scam (ahem,  New York  Magazine ). Dont listen. To be clear, this paper is just a review, not a study. In other words, its an opinion piece. And the advice it offers, experts say, can be potentially dangerous. As medical practitioners will tell you, there are a number of nutrients women need during pregnancy, and Americans are deficient in many of them. Not getting enough while youre expecting can have devastating effects for both mom and baby.     ADVERTISEMENT        Save Up to $3.00 on Alive! Multivitamins        I dont agree that prenatals are a thing of past, says Scott Sullivan, MD, the director of maternal-fetal medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). We have good data on a lot of these nutrients, so its premature to say we should just abandon prenatal vitamins. The  review , published in the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin , looked at past research to determine whether taking folic acid, iron, and vitamins A, C, D and E during pregnancy reduced the risks of complications including preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight or stillbirth. READ ALSO:  Choosing the Best Prenatal Vitamin The authors concluded that British women only need to take two supplements: 400 mcg of  folic acid  (before and up through 12 weeks of pregnancy), and  vitamin D  (which they said appeared to beneficial, though not as clear cut as folic acid). They added that much evidence for taking supplementation in pregnancy comes from studies done in low-income countries,where women are more likely to be malnourished. But there are several other nutrients ACOG recommends in a supplement for good reason. Here's the truth behind prenatal vitaims and exactly why you and your baby need them. Calcium:  ACOG recommends all women, not just pregnant women, get at least 1000 mg of calcium of day. But  calcium is especially important during pregnancy , since what you consume helps build babys teeth and skeleton. If youre not getting enough in your diet, baby will take it from your bones one reason why women whove been pregnant are at higher risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D, in turn, works with calcium to help support the demands of pregnancy. Without enough, your body cant process the calcium you need. Iron:   Anemia is very common in pregnancy , Sullivan notes. ""Thirty to 40 percent of my patients are iron deficient, he says. Being anemic can make you feel even more sick than pregnancy already does, plus put you at risk of a blood transfusion during delivery and complications in future pregnancies. Its very hard to be sure youre getting enough, which is why ACOG  recommends supplementing , Sullivan says. READ ALSO:  Your Prenatal Diet: An Infographic Iodine:  A quarter of American women are  deficient in iodine , says Sullivan, because people are eating less table salt and seafood, the nutrients two major sources. If you dont get enough iodine when youre expecting, it puts baby at risk for neurodevelopmental issues. Most women need a supplement of about 120 to 150 mcg. About half of all American prenatals currently contain iodine, Sullivan says, but all will in about two years. Two more  nutrients that are wise to get from your prenatal are vitamin B6  (which can help curb morning sickness) and  omega 3  (which helps build babys brain). Because there are so many of these recommended nutrients, a prenatal vitamin should be a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than taking a bunch of individual supplements. Sure, there are pricey ones out there, but they're not always the best, and some really good ones are cheap, Sullivan says. Still skeptical? Talk to your doctor about your diet and individual nutritional needs. What you eat is vitally important, and you cant get everything you need from a supplement, either. But your doctor will almost definitely recommend taking one anyway. Ask his or her advice to find the best, most cost-effective option. Some people need B12 supplements, some are people very low in vitamin D, some people have anemia,"" Sullivan says. ""All of which makes supplementing more complex than [the authors] would make it appear."

A Surprising Benefit of Drinking Milk During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0212/surprising-benefit-of-drinking-milk-during-pregnancy,"You already know that  getting enough of the right nutrients during pregnancy  helps your baby grow and supports your health, too. Now, a new study on expecting moms vitamin D intake shows that getting enough vitamin D during pregnancy may reduce baby's future risk of developing allergies. The research , conducted by professors at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, looked at the nutrition habits and vitamin D blood serum levels of 1,248 mothers across the United States. After measuring the vitamin-D levels of moms and babies at three points (pregnancy, birth and five to six years later), researchers found that the school-aged kids of moms who ate vitamin D-rich foods daily during pregnancy  but not those who took vitamin-D supplements  were 20 percent less likely to develop hay fever. The best news: Researchers in this study noted lower allergy risk among kids of moms who consumed as little as the equivalent of one 8-ounce serving of milk per day (about 100 IUs). What this means for you. In addition to helping build strong bones by helping the body to absorb calcium,  vitamin D is already known to play an important role in helping the immune system to function . And for the first year of life, babies vitamin D stores are wholly based on what they get from moms diet before birth. While your body can naturally produce vitamin D on its own, most moms don't spend a lot of time in the sun or regularly wear sunscreen, or have darker skin, which makes it all the more important to get enough vitamin D from foods. Ideally aim for 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day. A few foods that have high levels of vitamin D include: Pregnancy-safe fatty fish  (especially salmon)  which is also high in omega 3s (good for babys developing brain) Fortified cereal Orange juice (almost all OJs are fortified with vitamin D; check the label) Dairy products (soy and similar products are also often fortified with D; again check the label) Eggs Mushrooms 3 Things to Read Next: One Good Reason The Hospital Might Turn You Away During Labor New Act Protects Kids from Growing Poisoning Threat The 7 Must-Read Health Stories of 2015"

More in this article: Benefits of prenatal vitamins Nutrients you need Seals of approval Solving for common problems Safety tips The benefits of prenatal vitamins Take a daily prenatal vitamin before you start trying to conceive and you'll thank yourself later. Prenatal vitamins: ADVERTISING Cut back on nausea.  Vitamin B6 helps to reduce nausea  and research has shown that women who take a daily multivitamin before conception and/or during the first few weeks of pregnancy  experience fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting  during the first trimester (aka "" morning sickness ""). Boost fertility.  Not only will you be ensuring a healthier baby, you'll also be upping the chances that you'll actually make that healthy baby faster.Some research has shown that taking a prenatal vitamin may actually help increase fertility.  Reduce risk of birth defects.  Perhaps the most important (and best publicized) reason to take a prenatal vitamin is for the folic acid (known as folate when it's in food form) it contains. Studies show that getting enough folic acid before sperm meets egg and in  the early stages ofpregnancy  can dramatically reduce the risk of neural tube defects (like  spina bifida ) in your developing baby. Choose the best prenatal vitamin There are plenty of prenatal vitamin supplements on the market  so how do you pick? Your individual needs may differ, so its best to work directly with your doctor when determining the best plan for your prenatal vitamins. In the meantime, here are a few tips to help you choose the best prenatal vitamin: Get the right nutrients Take a look at the label of any prenatal vitamin youre considering for a few key vitamins: Folic acid: 600 mcg.  Since babys neural tube forms in the first month of pregnancy  before most women know that theyre pregnant  its ideal to start taking your prenatal vitamin before you start trying to conceive. So in addition to  eating plenty of folate-rich foods , opt for a vitamin with at least 600 mcg of folic acid (aka vitamin B9) throughout your pregnancy. For women whose family history shows a high risk of neural tube defects, guidelines recommend aiming for 10 times that amount (or four mg) from folic acid supplements  but always talk to your doctor before taking any additional supplements. Calcium:   150 mg.  Another crucial nutrient for women,  calcium is especially important  when  you're growing another set of bones  (your baby's). All women ages 19 to 50 need 1,000 mg per day. In addition to getting plenty of calcium in your diet from milk, yogurt or other  calcium-rich foods , make sure some is in your prenatal vitamin. If your doctor is still concerned youre not getting enough, he may recommend you take an additional supplement. Iron: 27mg.  This mineral is the building block for babys cells  and your body needs more than ever during pregnancy. If, like many women, you become  anemic during pregnancy , your doctor may recommend that you take more. Iodine: 150 mcg. Iodine aids your baby-to-be's thyroid and brain development  and studies have shown that many American women arent getting enough of this essential mineral. Thats why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pregnant women take a daily supplement of iodine and cook with iodized salt for a total intake of 220 mcg per day. If the supplement youre considering doesnt have any (or enough) iodine, talk to your doctor about taking a separate iodine supplement. Vitamin B6: 1.9mg.  This B vitamin helps decrease the potential for morning sickness  in fact,  prescription morning sickness drugs  are a combination of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and doxylamine (an antihistamine). Omega 3 fatty acids: Talk to your doctor.  Regular prenatal vitamins dont contain omega-3 fatty acids  a healthy type of fat found in many types of fish.  Omega-3 fatty acids  have been shown to aid in  babys brain development , both before and after birth. If youre unable to get the recommended two to three servings (8 to 12 ounces) of  pregnancy-safe fatty fish  per week, ask your doctor if you should take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement. A few other nutrients to be aware of: Vitamin A: No more than 10,000 IU.  More can be toxic. Look for beta-carotene, the safest source of vitamin A. Vitamin D: 600 IU.  Your body needs vitamin D, in combination with calcium, to grow your babys bones and keep yours strong. If your doctor suspects you may not be getting enough vitamin D (a relatively common issue among women), he or she may screen your levels at your first prenatal checkup. If youre deficient, hell recommend that you take an additional supplement of 1,000 to 2,000 IU. Zinc: 11 mg.  This mineral supports your immune system and healthy cell division.  Copper: 0.9 mg.  Your body uses this trace element to form blood cells as well as maintain nerve, bone and immune system health. Vitamin C: 85 mg.  You can get plenty of this vitamin, which helps your body to absorb iron and supports your immune system,  in your prenatal diet . More than 2,000 mg can be dangerous for your baby  so as always, dont take a supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin unless recommended by your doctor. Other:  Most prenatals contain two to three times the dietary reference intake (DRI) for vitamin E (12 mg), thiamin (1.2mg), riboflavin (1.2 mg), niacin (14 mg) and vitamin B12 (2.2 mg)  and there are no known harmful effects from such doses. Some preparations also contain magnesium, fluoride, biotin, phosphorus, pantothenic acid, extra B6 (to combat queasiness) and/or ginger (ditto). If you're a vegetarian or vegan during pregnancy , be sure to tell your doctor to ensure you're getting the right nutrients in your supplements. Look for an independent seal of approval Several groups independently verify dietary supplements (including prenatal vitamins) using rigorous criteria. If youd like extra reassurance that your supplement meets high standards, look for seals from the following organizations: United States Pharmacopeia (USP) NSF International Consumer Lab  However keep in mind that getting approval from one of these groups is a voluntary, not required, step for manufacturers. So if your prenatal vitamin isnt marked with one of these seals, it doesnt necessarily mean its not good. Bottom line: If youre at all concerned about the quality of the supplement youre taking, talk to your doctor.  Figure out if you can stomach it Once you choose your prenatal vitamin, you might find you have a tough time stomaching it. The most common reasons (and solutions): If you have trouble swallowing it,  look for a pill with a slicker coating. You may want to consider a pill sans calcium, since they tend to be smaller (calcium takes up a lot of space  if you do, be sure to talk to your practitioner to be sure you get enough of this essential mineral in other ways). You might also want to try a chewable or liquid prenatal vitamin (though you may have to try a few to find one with a taste that works for you). If it makes you feel nauseous,  try taking your vitamin with a meal or snack or right before you go to bed. Still having trouble? Try the above tips  or ask your doctor to recommend a different brand that you may be able to stomach better. If youve got constipation, diarrhea or gas,  it could be the extra iron in your pill. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids, eat fiber-rich foods and include regular physical activity in your daily routine. If this doesnt relieve your stomach woes, talk to your doctor about alternatives (i.e., a supplement without iron, or a separate iron preparation that dissolves in the intestines rather than in the more sensitive stomach, or one that is slow-release). Dont Overdo It More isn't better when it comes to vitamins. So stick with the recommended dosage, and don't take other extra supplements unless your doctor recommends it. Check in with your practitioner, too, if you're taking herbal supplements; some herbs can be harmful when you're trying to conceive. Keep in mind that prenatal vitamins complement a healthy diet, but they dont replace it. That means its still vitally important to eat a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet throughout your pregnancy. Think of your prenatal vitamin as a backup  not the other way around. Updated 8/27/15"
Prenatal Vitamins and Nausea,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ask-heidi/prenatal-vitamins-and-nausea.aspx,"When youre constantly queasy , the last thing you can stomach is the thought of swallowing a horse-sized pill chock-full of nausea-inducing vitamins and minerals. And yet, because you know that you  and, more importantly, your baby  need the nutrients, its hard to stop popping the pill (as much as it makes you miserable). The reality is, for most expectant moms its all too easy to fall short on the vitamins and minerals you and your baby need  especially during  the early months of pregnancy  when morning (and afternoon, and evening) sickness rules supreme. And since thats the stage of pregnancy when much of your babys most crucial construction occurs  like the formation of the organs and critical systems (particularly the nervous system and spine, which requires adequate doses of the vitamin folic acid, or folate)   prenatal vitamins are excellent insurance . Insurance is all well and good (you may be thinking), but do you have to suffer to reap the rewards? Of course not. There are plenty of ways to make the pill more palatable: Change when you take your pill.  Try taking your vitamin at the time of day when youre least nauseated. Sure, its easy to get in the habit of taking vitamins first thing in the morning (right after the deodorant, right before the toothbrushing), but your body doesnt care one way or another when the nutrients arrive. Some women find that their rolling stomach calms down late in the evening, and if thats when your queasiness quiets, give the pill a go then. Eat first. Whatever time of day you pop the pill, make sure your tummy isnt running on empty. All pills, including vitamins, are easier to stomach when accompanied by food, so try to eat something before you take the supplement. (Its a good idea anyway to avoid an empty tummy when youre sidelined with morning sickness. Without food to keep them busy, your stomach acids start to chew on you, a process that, not surprisingly, produces nausea.) Ask your doctor for recommendations.  If your prenatal vitamin is still making you sick, your practitioner may be able to prescribe a brand that wont be so tough on your tummy. The iron in prenatal vitamins can be particularly hard to digest, so you might get a formulation with less (or none, for now). One high in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may be able to quell the quease (ask your practitioner if he or she advises extra B6 supplements). Sometimes, over-the-counter formulas are better tolerated, although youll want to carefully check the labels to make sure they offer the right amount of vitamins and minerals. Or ask about slow-release supplements or chewables, which could provide some relief. At least theres a light at the end of the tunnel. Your nausea should abate within the next few weeks, and, with luck, youll be able to better tolerate those supplements. Heres to better feeling days ahead!"
SPONSORED: 6 FAQs About Prenatal Vitamins,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/prenatal-vitamin/six-faqs-about-prenatal-vitamins,"More from Nature Made SPONSORED: Does Your Prenatal Vitamin Have the Right Stuff? Stay up to date: Get a free personalized newsletter from What to Expect.com Sign Up Q. Do I have to take a prenatal vitamin, or can I just take a regular multivitamin? A. Prenatal vitamins are the best choice for pregnant women. Regular multivitamins could leave you with a serious deficit in key nutrients, especially folic acid, iron and calcium. Folic acid, in particular, is recommended by doctors as a safeguard against neural tube defects. A good brand of prenatal vitamins, such as Nature Made, will provide you with targeted nutrition that meets the special needs of the pregnant woman. Q.   What nutrients should I look for in a prenatal vitamin? A. Folic acid, iron, and calcium, as mentioned above. Prenatal vitamins have increased amounts of these nutrients to support the proper development of a baby's nervous system (folic acid) and increased nutrient needs of expectant moms, especially for iron, which is essential for red blood cell formation. Other critical nutrients that your prenatal vitamin should contain are vitamins A, C, D and E, as well as zinc. Q. How do I know which brand is best? A. First and foremost, check to be sure that your brand is USP verified. This means that the U. S. Pharmacopeia Convention has assessed the supplement and that it has passed a series of stringent tests. Note that the USP testing is voluntary. So if a brand carries the mark, it means the manufacturers are confident in the purity and efficacy of their product. It also means you can buy the brand with confidence. Q. How often should I take a prenatal vitamin? A. Most prenatal vitamins are taken daily. Some require you to take several pills over the course of the day. However, one-a-day products are more convenient. Make sure to follow your doctor's directions when it comes to the number of vitamins to take each day. Q. When should I start taking a prenatal vitamin? A. As soon as you start trying to get pregnant. Healthcare professionals recommend that women who are hoping to conceive should begin taking prenatal multivitamins to ensure that they are getting adequate amounts of folic acid, and continue taking them through the entire pregnancy.

Stay up to date: Get a free personalized newsletter from What to Expect.com Sign Up A healthy pregnancy starts with good nutrition. But even if you're loading up on all the right stuff, and your plate is more colorful than a box of crayons, your doctor has probably recommended that you take a prenatal vitamin. Some of the key nutrients that are essential for your baby's development are hard to get through diet alone. Here's a quick guide to what you should look for in a prenatal vitamin  and what to avoid. THE SUPERSTARS Prenatal vitamins contain important nutrients, including folic acid, iron and calcium that help support your growing baby as well as your nutrient needs during pregnancy. Folic Acid.  This B vitamin plays a critical role in the proper development of a baby's nervous system. Adequate folic acid, in a healthy diet, may reduce the risk for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD). This occurs when the neural tube, which later develops into the brain and spine, fails to close properly during the first two trimesters. Iron.  Your pregnant body is manufacturing additional blood for both you and your baby. Iron is vital for red blood cell formation and a key part of hemoglobin, a protein that enables red blood cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body. Without adequate iron, you could become anemic. Calcium.  Calcium helps build and support strong bones. It's important throughout your pregnancy, but calcium takes center stage during your third trimester, when your baby's bones are growing quickly. SUPPORTING PLAYERS These nutrients play an important supporting role in your prenatal health. Check to be sure your prenatal vitamin contains all these elements as well: Vitamins A, C and D, as well as zinc, which help support the immune system. Vitamins C and E, which are antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals. B vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12, which support cellular energy production. WHAT TO AVOID What's not in your prenatal vitamin is almost as important as what is. Check the label on your vitamin to make sure you don't see any of the following: Synthetic dyes Added color Artificial flavor Preservatives Yeast or starch Gluten STARTING A PRENATAL VITAMIN REGIMEN As with any dietary supplement, be sure to check with your healthcare practitioner before beginning a regimen. And of course, take only the recommended amount, so you get the benefits of a healthy body and a healthy baby.

Yet Another Reason to Get Plenty of Folic Acid While You're Pregnant,http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/high-levels-folate-in-pregnancy-lower-risk-of-high-blood-pressure-in-children/,"Of all the nutrients packed into your daily  prenatal supplement ,  folic acid  is one of the most important. Now a new study is offering one more reason to get your daily fix of this precious vitamin: Among women with risk factors such as  diabetes  and obesity, high folate levels during pregnancy may reduce the likelihood that their kids will develop high blood pressure. WHAT THE STUDY LOOKED AT The study , published this week in the  American Journal of Hypertension , evaluated 1,290 mother-child pairs who participated in a Boston Medical Center study from birth up to age 9. Roughly 38 percent of the moms had at least one cardiometabolic risk factor such as a hypertensive disorder, diabetes or pre-pregnancy obesity. About 29 percent of the children had high blood pressure during a doctors visit between the ages of 3 and 9. The women had their blood drawn a few days after delivery, and researchers looked at the link between folic acid levels in that sample and whether their babies developed high blood pressure.   ADVERTISEMENT     Inoperable Skin Cancer   Get Information on an Advanced   Skin Cancer Treatment Option.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com     WHAT THE RESEARCH FOUND Among participating moms who had a hypertensive disorder, diabetes or pre-pregnancy obesity, those with high folic acid levels were 40 percent less likely to have a child who developed high blood pressure, compared to those with lower folate levels. Mothers who had no risk factors didnt see the same results. Doctors already know that moms with these risk factors are more likely to have children with high blood pressure, which can in turn lead to adult cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, among other problems. This study indicates that high folic acid intake may help counteract that risk. ""Our study adds further evidence on the early life origins of high blood pressure,"" Dr. Xiaobin Wang, one of the study's authors, said in a statement. ""Our findings raise the possibility that early risk assessment and intervention before conception and during pregnancy may lead to new ways to prevent high blood pressure and its consequences. The researchers acknowledged there were some limitations to the study. The women's blood was drawn two to three days after they delivered, which doesnt provide a clear indication of what their folate levels were during the entire pregnancy. Additionally, participants were mostly low-income people of color, and an unusually high portion of the children involved were  preterm  and/or had low  birth weight , which might have affected the results. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU If you have hypertensive disorder, diabetes or were obese before you got pregnant, its even more important than usual to get enough folic acid throughout your pregnancy. Remember, folic acid is a key nutrient while you're growing a baby: It plays a role in creating your childs DNA, red blood cells, heart and circulatory system, plus it helps prevent a number of birth defects. Your prenatal vitamin should contain at least 400 mg of folic acid, and you can also get it from  folate-rich foods  like dark leafy greens, avocados and legumes. Ideally, you should be getting 600 mg of folic acid daily from all sources, including foods and your prenatal vitamin. Keep in mind, though, that these findings don't mean you should be taking excessive amounts of folic acid (or any other nutrient, for that matter) while you're expecting. Stick to the recommended amounts unless your doctor says otherwise. This and other studies reinforce the fact that what you eat during pregnancy may have an impact on your babys health later in life. So talk to your practitioner regularly to make sure youre getting all the nutrients you need every step of the way.

Newborn Screenings: What Tests Will My Baby Get in the Hospital?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/health-and-safety/newborn-screening-tests-and-procedures/,"Though most babies are born healthy and stay that way, a very small percentage are apparently healthy at birth and then get sick because of a metabolic disorder -- which can be potentially life-threatening if left undetected and untreated. Other babies are born with various rare but serious conditions, like hearing impairment or a congenital heart condition. Luckily, tests can catch all of these conditions early, and proper treatment can, in many cases, be life-saving. The following screening test and procedures are designed to make sure your little one gets the healthiest start to life. How Many Tests and Screenings Will My Newborn Need In Total? Your baby will require at least 21 and up to 32 newborn screenings. What Kind of Tests Will My Newborn Baby Get? The newborn screenings your baby will most likely undergo include: A rating on the  Apgar  scale:  A simple and essential assessment of babys condition done between one and five minutes after birth. A congenital heart disease screening:  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends, and some states require, screening tests soon after birth for congenital heart defects. This condition, which affects 1 in 100 babies, can lead to disability or death if not caught and treated in time. Happily, when a baby gets a diagnosis and treatment early, those risks are reduced significantly -- and in most cases, completely. 21 (or more) types of blood screens:  A single blood test looks for at least 21 serious genetic, metabolic, hormonal and functional disorders, including PKU, hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, biotinidase deficiency, maple syrup urine disease, galactosemia, homocystinuria, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and sickle cell anemia. A hearing test:  For 2 to 4 out of every 1,000 babies born each year in the U.S., the sense of hearing -- so integral to the development of speech and language -- is impaired. Since a deficit can affect so many aspects of a childs development, early diagnosis and treatment are key, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorses the test for all newborn babies. In addition to the core newborn screening tests, your baby will also receive: Eye ointment to prevent infection A  vitamin K injection The first dose of the  hepatitis B vaccine sometime before hospital discharge How Is My Baby Tested? Blood test:  To test for the 21+ possible metabolic disorders, a few drops of blood are routinely taken using a single heel stick soon after birth. Congenital heart disease:  Screening is simple and painless. A sensor is placed on your babys skin to measure your little ones pulse and the amount of oxygen in his or her blood. If the results of the screening seem questionable, the doctor will be able to do further testing (like an echocardiogram, or an ultrasound of the heart, for instance) to determine if anything is wrong. Newborn hearing screening:  One test, called otoacoustic emissions (OAE), measures response to sound by using a small probe inserted in babys ear canal. In babies with normal hearing, a microphone inside the probe records faint noises coming from the babys ear in response to a noise produced by the probe. The test can be done while baby is sleeping, is completed within a few minutes and causes no pain or discomfort. A second screening method, called auditory brainstem response (ABR), uses electrodes placed on babys scalp to detect activity in the brain stems auditory region in response to clicks sounded in the newborn's ear. ABR screening requires the infant to be awake and in a quiet state, but its also quick and painless. If your baby doesnt pass the initial screening, the test will be repeated to avoid false-positive results. What is the Apgar Test? The Apgar test is the first screening most newborns are given; the scores -- rated on a scale of 0 to 10, and taken one minute and again five minutes after birth -- reflect babys general condition. Theyre based on observations made in five assessment categories (like skin color and heartbeat). READ MORE:  Your Baby's Apgar Test What Is the Vitamin K Shot? Since most babies are born with low levels of vitamin K, they'll get a vitamin K shot within six hours of birth to enhance their blood-clotting ability and prevent a potentially dangerous condition from cropping up. READ MORE:  Vitamin K Injection in Newborns Will My Baby Require Every Test? Can I Opt Out of Newborn Screening Tests? All 50 states and the District of Columbia require newborn screenings for at least 21 metabolic disorders, and more than half of all states screen newborns for all 29 disorders for which the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommends testing. Check with your practitioner or your local board of health to find out what tests are done in your state. You can also look up your states requirements at the  National Newborn Screening & Genetics Resource Centers (NNSGRC) website . If youre concerned, discuss your fears at a prenatal visit  dont wait until delivery day speak up. You do have the right to opt out of any test or procedure, but you will need to sign paperwork documenting your decision. In some cases, the hospital might even inform the states department of child services that youve decided to forgo the recommended screening. Keep in mind, although most of these conditions are very rare, they can be life-threatening if they go undetected and untreated. Testing is inexpensive, and in the very unlikely event that your baby tests positive for any of them, the pediatrician can verify the results and begin treatment immediately, making a huge difference in the prognosis. So its really in your child's best interest to get all the screenings your pediatrician and hospital recommend. Will My Baby Need More Tests Than the Required Screenings? Certain states require additional secondary newborn screenings in their heel-stick tests, sometimes because of an at-risk population in the area. To check which conditions must be tested for in your state, visit  www.babysfirsttest.org , a resource funded by the governments Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Will My Insurance Cover All the Newborn Screening Tests? Under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare),  your insurance is required to cover  the following newborn screenings: Congenital hypothyroidism Sickle cell anemia PKU Hearing screening Theres a good chance your insurance will cover all the other blood tests as well as the one for congenital heart defects, so be sure to check. Can I Ask for More Newborn Screening Tests? If your hospital doesnt automatically provide all 29 newborn blood tests, you can arrange to have them done. In fact, private labs can screen for up to 40 metabolic disorders. Talk to your doctor, then check with your insurance to calculate your out-of-pocket costs, if any. If your state doesnt require an echocardiogram to test for congenital heart disease, ask your babys pediatrician if your little one can get one anyway. Are All Newborn Tests Safe? Yes. All newborn tests have a proven track record of protecting babies and were recommended only after extensive research. Theyre not only perfectly safe for your little one -- theyre highly recommended.

Baby Sun Safety – Vitamin D and Safe Time in the Sun,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/librarianmommyreferencebookonparenting/baby-sun-safety-vitamin-d-and-safe-time-in-the-sun,"Practicing baby sun safety is extremely important. Overexposure to the sun at a young age results in a reduced risk of skin cancer as an adult. However, getting enough sunlight each day is also important. When the skin is exposed to direct sunlight, the body produces vitamin D.  Vitamin D  is an essential nutrient for good health. Getting enough vitamin D is thought to protect a person against osteoporosis, high blood pressure, several autoimmune diseases, and even cancer. In other words, getting too much sun can lead to cancer, but not getting enough sun can also lead to cancer. Baby sun protection therefore means getting just enough sunlight to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D without letting the skin tan or burn. So, when it comes to baby sun safety, how much sunlight is enough sunlight? Experts recommend that individuals with fair skin get about ten minutes of sunlight each day. People with darker skin tones will need slightly longer amounts of time in the sun in order for the body to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D. Most importantly, for the body to make enough vitamin D, the skin must be bare and free from sunscreen. Direct sunlight is important, so go outside and skip the baby sun protection for about ten minutes each day. Why exactly is getting enough vitamin D from sunlight so important? First, although a person can get vitamin D from dietary sources such as fish, eggs, fortified milk, and cod liver oil, the easiest and most efficient way to get adequate amounts of vitamin D is through direct sunlight.  Research  has indicated that, without enough vitamin D, an individual has more than double the risk of dying from heart disease and other causes including an increased risk of heart attacks.     Save Now On Alive!   Get Your Coupon For Any   Alive! Multi-Vitamin   FeelAlive.com       Both vitamin D and baby sun safety are extremely important to me. I want to keep my daughter healthy without increasing her risk of skin cancer in the future. Therefore, my husband and I practice baby sun safety with her. Because she is younger than six months right now, we do not want to use baby sun protection measures such as sunscreen on her quite yet. (Six months is the recommended age to start using sunscreen.) Therefore, we try to keep her inside during the sunniest times of the day. However, because we want to make sure that she gets enough vitamin D, we do take her outside for no more than ten minutes when the weather permits. She loves when the warm sun shines down on her skin. I love that she is soaking up the yummy rays of sun and making vitamin D to keep her healthy. With the importance of vitamin D in mind, how do you practice baby sun safety? Want to know more about me? Please follow Librarian_Mom online on  Facebook  and  Twitter .

Vegan Toddler Hospitalized Because Parents Ignored This Rule of Kids and Alternative Diets,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/0711/vegan-toddler-hospitalized-because-his-parents-didnt-know-this-about-alternative-diets,"A 14-month-old Italian boy, whose parents kept him on a vegan diet, was hospitalized earlier this month with severe malnutrition. He weighed only 5 kg, or 11 lbs, the same as an average 3 month-old. The boy, living in Milan with his mom and dad, was not given any dietary supplements, which lowered his calcium levels to ""the minimum needed to survive,""  Italian paper  The Local  reports , and aggravated a heart condition (not caused by his diet) to the point that he required emergency surgery. He's recovering well. Following the surgery, hospital staff reported his condition to social services because they said his parents refused to give him a more complete diet even after doctors asked them to. A local court has placed him in the custody of the hospital until the investigation of his parents is complete.     Melanoma Therapy   Get the Facts on Advanced Melanoma   & a Treatment Option that May Help.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       If  you and your toddler are vegetarian  or vegan, this story probably pisses you off  and rightfully so. To some, these parents, along with  several   similar   ones , will give meat- and meat-product-free families a bad rap. But the truth is plenty of parents raise healthy children with alternative diets because they take care to still meet  all  of their baby's nutritional needs. No one knows for sure what drove the parents of this little boy to make their dietary choices or exactly what they were feeding him, but it's clear they were not following guidelines and compromised his wellbeing as a result. ""It is not a problem to choose different or unusual kinds of nutrition, and we certainly do not want to enter into a discussion of the merits of the decision,""  said Luca Bernardo, the hospital's pediatric director . ""But since birth, the baby should have had support in this case with calcium and iron."" So what are the  recommendations for raising a child on a vegan diet ? First, as long as his or her eating patterns are well-planned, know that veganism and vegetarianism are ""perfectly healthy for infants and toddlers,"" according to the  American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics . Just follow medical recommendations and consult with your pediatrician along the way. Next, doctors still recommend breast milk as the main (or only) source of nutrition for the first 6 months of baby's life. If you do not  breastfeed , opt for iron-fortified formula, which comes in soy if you're vegan. When baby is 4 to 6 months or older, you can  introduce solids  in pretty much the same way you would for a non-vegan or -vegetarian child. Try tofu or beans instead of meat and soy yogurt and cheese. If you're vegan, you may want to consider breastfeeding for more than a year (the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization). Wean with soy-milk formula fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Don't use milk alternatives (soy, rice, almond) during baby's first year. The most important part of feeding your baby or toddler a vegan or vegetarian diet, which can have serious health consequences if ignored, is getting your children enough of the nutrients that normally come from meat and dairy. These are: Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Protein and Fiber. Although this story is heartbreaking and even infuriating to some, these parents do not represent all vegan or vegetarian parents or this lifestyle. Feed your child however you feel is best; just don't confuse your beliefs with their needs."
The Sun Factor,,
Vitamins and Babies,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-your-baby/vitamins-and-babies.aspx,"The lactation consultant, your new mom friends, the latest health-news flash you read online  each one probably has a different take on vitamins and babies. So how can you make sense of all that conflicting advice? And, bottom line  does your baby really need a vitamin supplement? Well, the answer depends on whether you're  breastfeeding  or not. If youre breastfeeding your baby:  Maybe you assumed that breast milk is the perfect food complete with every vitamin your newborn could need. And while breast milk  is  the ideal food for newborns, it doesnt contain enough of two crucial nutrients: vitamin D and iron. Vitamin D is essential for building strong bones, among other things, while iron is necessary for healthy blood cells and brain development; babies also need the mineral to prevent iron deficiency (a problem for many little kids) and iron deficiency anemia. Because breastmilk lacks these two essential nutrients, doctors recommend all breastfed babies get 400 IU a day of vitamin D in the form of a supplement, starting in the first few days of life. Breastfed  and  partially breastfed babies should take 1 mg/kg oral iron supplements a day starting at four months until iron-rich solids (like cereals, meat, and green vegetables) can be introduced. But babies need a whopping 11 mg of iron a day, so your doctor may even recommend that your little one continue to take the supplement until he gets the iron he needs from food. The pediatrician will probably suggest an over-the-counter (OTC) liquid vitamin D supplement for your baby (many of them contain vitamins A and C too, which is fine for your little one to have  adequate vitamin C intake actually improves iron absorption). Worried that your little one wont cooperate and swallow? Relax. Most infant vitamin drops are tasty, so your baby won't have a problem gulping the supplement down. Feel free to give it to him whenever its most convenient for the two of you. Some moms get into the habit of giving their babies the vitamins before their morning nursing session, while other moms top off the day with vitamin dessert. If youre pumping and bottle feeding, you can also add the vitamins to a bottle of breast milk. What about getting vitamin D through sunlight instead? While its true that people of any age can absorb vitamin D through exposure to the suns rays, tanning isnt exactly a recommended pastime for infants. So the safest way to ensure your breastfed baby gets his quota of vitamin D is to give him a supplement daily. If youre  formula feeding  your baby:  When it comes to vitamins and babies who are on formula, its a different story. Formula is already fortified with vitamin D, iron, and many other super nutrients, so as long as your infant is getting about 32 ounces of formula each day, hes getting all the nutrients he needs at this point in his young life. But once he  starts solids   especially when hes eating them regularly and drinking less formula  itll be a whole new nutritional ball game. Hell start to get less of his nutrition from formula and more of his nutrition from foods, so at that point, youll want to have a conversation with your pediatrician about supplementing both vitamin D and iron (and possibly other vitamins), especially if you have a picky eater on your hands. Other vitamin variables to consider:  There are a few more caveats to consider when it comes to vitamins and babies. Talk with your pediatrician if these conditions apply to you or your baby: Your baby was premature or has health problems. Youre breastfeeding and youre a vegan, which may mean that you're not getting enough B12, iron, zinc, or calcium. Youre breastfeeding and you think your diet is lacking some important vitamins and minerals. See all  baby feeding tips ."

Flu During Pregnancy: What You Need to Know to Stay Safe,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/flu-during-pregnancy/,"When youre expecting, your body suppresses your immune system in order to support your baby  leaving you more susceptible than usual to viruses. That means youre more likely to get sick with a cold, flu or other illness while youre pregnant. The flu, which most often announces itself with body aches,  fever  and/or chills, can be dangerous for pregnant women, potentially leading to serious complications requiring hospitalization. Thats why its so important that all expectant moms get a flu vaccine before flu season arrives. Whether youve already caught the flu or are deciding whether you need to get immunized against it, heres what you need to know to protect yourself and your baby. What causes the flu during pregnancy? Cases of the flu are caused by influenza viruses. Because the influenza virus is constantly mutating, there are an unlimited number of flu viruses  which also explains why the flu vaccine is different each year (and why even if youve had the shot in the past, you need to get a new one each flu season). What are the symptoms of the flu? Influenza (aka the flu) is more severe and comes on more suddenly  than a cold . Symptoms include: Fever (usually 102F to 104F or higher) Headache Chills A sore throat that generally worsens by the second or third day Intense muscle soreness General weakness and fatigue Occasional sneezing Cough that can become severe How long does the flu last? Symptoms of the flu typically last two weeks, though they can last longer . Can the flu be dangerous during pregnancy?  Being pregnant definitely puts you at greater risk for the flu's more serious complications, like pneumonia. In fact, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized from complications of the flu than non-pregnant women of the same age (which is why getting the flu shot as a preventative measure is such a good idea). Can having the flu during pregnancy harm my baby? But what happens if you didnt get the flu shot for some reason and then you do end up getting the flu? Here are some worries you may have: Miscarriage.  The flu is unlikely to increase your  risk for miscarriage : Your body is programmed to protect your baby-to-be, even when youre feeling miserable. That said, having a high fever does increase the risk of miscarriage and other complications. Autism or other developmental disorders.  Though you may have heard about some research that found a slightly higher risk of autism in children whose moms had the flu during pregnancy, its unlikely that the flu itself is the contributory factor to the increased risk. Most experts agree that a  high fever is more likely the cause . Preterm birth.  There appears to be a slightly higher risk of  premature labor and preterm birth  in women who have an untreated case of the flu during pregnancy. Birth defects.  High fevers during the first trimester have been linked to birth defects in the baby. As you can see, all of the above are reasons why its so important to treat any fever as recommended by your practitioner (whether you have the flu or another infection). Can I get the flu shot during pregnancy?  Yes,  it's safe to get the flu shot during pregnancy . In fact, you definitely  should  get it: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all moms-to-be get the flu shot to keep safe during flu season. As an added bonus, getting immunized during the last trimester of pregnancy not only protects you, but it also helps protect your baby from the flu until hes old enough for a flu shot himself. The flu vaccine offers the most protection if its given before flu season or early on during it (preferably by October). Its never 100 percent effective because it protects only against the influenza viruses that are expected to cause the most problems in a particular year. Still, it greatly increases the chance that youll escape the season flu-free. Keep in mind that the nasal spray vaccine (FluMist, which is made from live flu virus), is not approved for or given to pregnant women, so youll have to stick with the needle version during pregnancy. What happens if I get the flu while pregnant? The same tips that can help keep you comfortable when youve got a cold can also be used when youre down with a bout of the flu. They include: Resting when you feel fatigued Eating well:  Focus on eating lots of  vitamin C foods  (kiwis, pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, blackberries, raspberries, tomatoes, edamame, kale, broccoli and spinach) and foods that are high in zinc (lean red meat, skinless chicken breast, eggs, chickpeas, lentils, black beans, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, kale, garlic and pumpkin seeds) to help boost your immune system Taking your prenatal vitamin, which offers a pregnancy-safe dose of vitamin C and zinc in addition to the folate, calcium and other nutrients you and your baby need Drinking plenty of fluids  to soothe your sore throat and replace whats lost by fever Having a couple spoonfuls of honey, which can be soothing and actually help suppress a cough as well as an OTC cough suppressant Since a fever can be dangerous for you and your unborn baby, youll need to take steps to reduce it: Take a fever-reducing medication (acetaminophen  a.k.a. Tylenol  is the safest bet; see below for the medications you should avoid) Try a tepid bath or shower Drink plenty of cool beverages Keep clothing and bed covers light Remember, too, that if you're suffering from flu symptoms, it's important to call your practitioner. Because the flu can be serious in pregnant women, your practitioner will probably want to treat you with an antiviral mediation like Tamiflu. Antiviral medications work best if you take them within two days of getting sick. The sooner youre treated, the safer you and your baby will be. Safe medications for the flu during pregnancy While many of the medications you used to reach for before you became pregnant are off-limits now, there are still  some meds that are safe to take  to relieve symptoms of the flu during pregnancy: Antivirals.  Tamiflu  and other antivirals are safe (and important to take) if prescribed by a practitioner who has diagnosed you with the flu. Acetaminophen.  If you're running a fever or suffering from nasty body aches or headaches, it's generally considered safe to take products containing acetaminophen, such as Tylenol. Cough remedies.  Expectorants (like Mucinex) as well as cough suppressants (such as Robitussin or Vicks44) as well as most cough drops are considered safe during pregnancy, but ask your practitioner about dosing. Some nasal sprays.  Most steroid-containing nasal sprays are fine to use during pregnancy, but check with your doctor about brands and dosing. Plain saline drops and sprays are always safe to take when you're expecting and can help clear and moisturize a stuffy nose. Some antihistamines.  Benadryl and Claritin often get the green light during pregnancy, but be sure to check with your practitioner before taking them. Some doctors will advise staying away from those medications in the first trimester. Remember: Never take any medication (prescription, over the counter or homeopathic) without consulting with a doctor who knows youre expecting. And dont put off calling the doctor or refuse to take a medication she prescribes because you think all drugs are harmful in pregnancy. When it comes to the flu, the sooner youre treated, the safer you and your baby will be. Medications to avoid during pregnancy Some of the medications that could help with flu symptoms when youre not pregnant are off-limits to moms-to-be because they may cause harm to their unborn baby. These include: Some pain relievers.  Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), or naproxen (Aleve) are off-limits during pregnancy because they can be harmful to mom and baby. Most decongestants.  Decongestants like Claritin-D, Sudafed or DayQuil should be avoided when youre expecting (though those featuring phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine may be okay to take during pregnancy with your doctors approval). Even those experts who say its okay to take certain decongestants will caution that its only safe to use after the first trimester and only as long as its used in a limited amount. Some nasal sprays.  Steer clear of nonsteroidal nasal decongestant sprays containing ozymetazoline (like Afrin) unless given the green light by your practitioner. Many will tell you to avoid these sprays completely while you're expecting, while others will advise only limited use (one or two days at a time) after the first trimester. Homeopathic remedies.  Never take Echinacea or other supplements (like zinc and vitamin C) without medical approval.

Colds During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/colds-during-pregnancy/,"When youre expecting, your immune system runs at a lower speed than usual  which is actually a good thing, since it keeps your body from fighting off the baby (who is, technically, a foreigner to your body, even if he or she doesnt seem foreign to you). The downside of this immune suppression, though, is that your body can't fight off colds as well as it normally does, making you more vulnerable than usual to the stuffy nose, cough and sore throat that come with the virus. Fortunately, colds are mostly an uncomfortable annoyance. That said, its important to be aware that youre better off avoiding some cold medications during pregnancy. Heres what you need to know to feel better and stay safe. What causes colds during pregnancy? Colds are most commonly caused by a type of virus known as a rhinovirus. There are 200 or more cold viruses, which is why you keep on getting them. What are the symptoms of colds? A cold usually begins with a sore or scratchy throat that lasts for a day or two, followed by the gradual appearance of cold symptoms, including: A runny (and later stuffy) nose Lots of sneezing Mild fatigue A dry cough, particularly near the colds end, which may continue for a week or more after other symptoms have subsided Little or no fever (usually under 100F) Is it a cold  or the flu? You can usually tell the difference between a cold and the flu by taking stock of the symptoms. A cold , even a bad one, is milder than the flu. Its symptoms come on gradually ,  and theres usually no fever. The sore throat that usually starts off the cold goes away after a day or two, leaving the runny nose and cough as the main symptoms. Influenza (a.k.a. the flu)  is more severe and comes on more suddenly than a cold.  Symptoms of the flu  include high fever (usually 102F to 104F or higher), headache, chills, a sore throat that generally worsens by the second or third day (unlike in the cold), often intense muscle soreness, and general weakness and fatigue (which can last a couple of weeks or longer). You may also experience occasional sneezing and a cough that can become severe. What can you do if you get a cold during pregnancy? Although many of the medications that relieve cold symptoms are typically off-limits during pregnancy, you dont have to suffer with a runny nose and hacking cough when youre pregnant. Some of the most effective cold remedies dont come from the pharmacy shelf. These tips can help you feel better faster: Rest.  Taking a cold to bed doesnt necessarily shorten its duration, but if your body is begging for some rest, be sure to listen. Stay active.  If youre not running a fever or coughing and you feel up to it, light to moderate,  pregnancy-safe exercise  may actually help you feel better faster. Keep eating.  Sure, you probably dont have much of an appetite, but  eating as healthily as possible  when you do feel up to eating can help with some of your cold symptoms. Focus on foods with vitamin C.  Theycan help boost your immune system naturally. Try all types of citrus fruits (oranges, tangerines, grapefruit), strawberries, melon, kiwi, mango, tomatoes, bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, red cabbage and spinach. Chow down on more zinc. It may also help boost the immune system. Fill up on turkey, beef, pork, cooked oysters, eggs, yogurt, wheat germ and oatmeal. Drink up.  Fever, sneezes and a runny nose will cause your body to lose fluids that you and your baby need. Warm beverages will be particularly soothing, so keep a thermos of a hot drink (like ginger tea) or hot soup (like chicken broth) next to your bed and try to  drink enough to stay well hydrated  (your pee should be the color of pale straw). Water and cold juices work fine, too, if thats what youre thirsting for. Supplement safely.   Taking your prenatal vitamin , which contains vitamin C and zinc, is smart even when youre fighting a cold (but dont take any other supplements beyond your prenatal without your doctors approval). Sleep easy.  Breathe easier when youre lying down or sleeping by elevating your head with a couple of pillows. Nasal strips (which gently pull your nasal passages open, making breathing easier) may help, too. Theyre sold over the counter and are completely drug-free. When to see the doctor Call your doctor if: You have a fever over 100 F Your cold is severe enough to interfere with eating or sleeping Youre coughing up greenish or yellowish mucus You have a cough with chest pain or wheezing Your sinuses are throbbing If symptoms last more than 10 to 14 days: Its possible that your cold has progressed to a secondary infection, and a prescription medication may be needed for your safety and your babys Safe medications for colds during pregnancy Before you reach for anything in your medicine cabinet when youre in bed with a cold, reach for the phone to call your practitioner so you can ask which remedies are considered safe in pregnancy, as well as which will work best in your case.  Some remedies youre used to taking may not be safe during pregnancy . So what cold medications are generally considered safe during pregnancy? Acetaminophen.  If you're running a fever or suffering from nasty body aches or headaches, it's generally considered safe to take products containing acetaminophen (like Tylenol). Cough medications.  Expectorants (like Mucinex), cough suppressants (such as Robitussin or Vicks44), vapor rubs (like Vicks) as well as most cough drops are considered safe during pregnancy, but ask your practitioner about dosing. Some nasal sprays.  Most steroid-containing nasal sprays are fine to use during pregnancy, but check with your doctor about brands and dosing. Plain saline drops and sprays are always safe to take when you're expecting and can help clear and moisturize a stuffy nose. Some antihistamines.  Benadryl and Claritin often get the green light during pregnancy, but be sure to check with your practitioner before taking them. Some doctors will advise staying away from those medications in the first trimester. Always check with your practitioner before you take any medication (prescription, over the counter or homeopathic), or consult the instruction sheet she gave you on your first visit. And dont put off calling the doctor or refuse to take a medication she prescribes because you think all drugs are harmful in pregnancy. Many are not. But do be sure the prescribing doctor knows youre expecting. Medications to avoid during pregnancy Some of the medications that could help with cold symptoms are off limits to moms-to-be because they may cause harm to their unborn baby. These include: Some pain relievers and fever reducers.  Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) can interfere with your baby's development in the early months and be problematic during labor. Most decongestants.  Most practitioners say to stay clear of decongestants such as Claritin-D, Sudafed or DayQuil. Even those experts who say its okay to take some decongestants will probably caution that they're only safe to use after the first trimester, and only in a limited amount (i.e. once or twice daily for no more than a day or two). Some nasal sprays.  Steer clear of nonsteroidal nasal decongestant sprays containing ozymetazoline (like Afrin) unless given the green light by your practitioner. Many will tell you to avoid these sprays completely while you're expecting, while others will advise only limited use (one or two days at a time) after the first trimester. Homeopathic remedies.  Dont take Echinacea, supplemental vitamins (like zinc supplements) or other over-the-counter herbal remedies without medical approval. Alternative treatments for cold Not one for taking medications to alleviate those cold symptoms? You can try the following natural ways to treat your cold: Eat fresh garlic.  Garlic is known to have virus-fighting compounds, so take a bite or two or add to soup or stir-fry. Run a humidifier.  Keeping your nasal passages moist will ease congestion, especially at night. Saline nose drops, sprays or rinses.  These help moisten your nasal passages; since theyre un-medicated, theyre completely safe to use as often as you need. (Just avoid neti pots, since theyre more apt to spread germs.) Saltwater gargles.  Gargling with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water) can ease a scratchy or sore throat, wash away postnasal drip and help control a cough. Honey.  A couple of teaspoons straight (or mixed in hot water with lemon) has been shown to help suppress the kind of dry cough that often comes with and after a cold at least as effectively as an OTC cough syrup.

Half of Breastfeeding Moms Not Giving Babies Important Vitamin D Supplement,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/breastfeeding-moms-not-giving-babies-vitamin-d-study/,"Breast milk is natures ideal food -- but it doesnt offer enough of the vitamin D babies need to support their rapidly growing bones. Thats why doctors recommend  giving breastfed babies  400 IUs of a liquid vitamin D every day. However a new study finds that only about one in two  breastfeeding  moms may be offering their babies this important supplement. That amounts to half of breastfed infants who may not be getting the vitamins they need. What the study found Researchers at the Mayo Clinic surveyed a total of 184 moms, 140 who exclusively breastfed and 44 who  supplemented with formula . Only 55 percent of nursing moms gave their babies the recommended vitamin D supplement, and just 42 percent gave their babies the full 400 IUs. The study, published in the journal  Annals of Family Medicine,  found that a full 88 percent of moms in the study said theyd rather pop a pill themselves than give a vitamin to their babies. Many cited safety as the most important consideration in choosing how to ensure their infants were getting the recommended amount of vitamin D. What moms should know Babies need 400 IUs of vitamin D in their diets every day to avoid preventable and potentially serious health complications. Severe deficiency can lead to rickets (soft bones), seizures due to low calcium, and even heart failure in infants, explains Tom Thacher, MD, a professor of family medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study.     Save Now On Alive!   Get Your Coupon For Any   Alive! Multi-Vitamin   FeelAlive.com       Babies can, however, reap the benefits if Mom takes a vitamin D supplement herself -- but only if the dose is high enough. The authors note that one of the advantages of the mother taking the vitamin is that its slightly easier for an adult to pop a pill than it is to administer a dropper of medicine (even if it does taste yummy) to baby. Whats more, taking a pill helps avoid  baby dosing errors  (which are more common than you might think but easily avoidable if you carefully follow the instructions on the bottle). Many moms continue to  take a prenatal vitamin  after birth, but they contain just 600 IUs of D -- not nearly enough to cover both Mom and baby. And no more than 10 percent of the daily dose a mother takes is found in a liter of her breast milk, explains Thacher. If a mother takes 4000 IU per day, her breast milk will typically contain approximately 400 IU in one liter, or 32 ounces, says Thacher. But newborns do not consistently consume up to one liter per day until they reach the age of 3 months, so moms may take doses up to 6000 IU per day in order to meet the infants recommended intake. The authors conclude that taking an additional daily supplement of 6000 IUs of vitamin D for the first three months of babys life on top of whats already in a prenatal vitamin would be a safe and effective way for breastfeeding moms to cover their babies needs through breast milk. After the third month, when babys eating more, you could drop down to 4000 IUs per day. What you can do If youd like to skip the vitamin D supplement for your breastfeeding baby, talk to your doctor about taking it yourself. He or she can help you determine if its the right choice for both of you, as well as the advise you on the exact dose you should take."

Baby Teeth Types and Order of Appearance,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/teething/order-of-baby-teeth-tooth-chart/,"You wait, you peek, you might even poke, you get through some fitful nights with your unusually fussy baby  and ta-da! That first teeny tiny baby tooth appears. But once those little pearly whites start popping up, then what? Baby teeth, also called primary or deciduous teeth, are temporary placeholders for the permanent set, but they play an important role in your child's development. Heres what you should know about your babys brand new teeth. When Will Babys First Tooth Emerge? When it comes to the tooth eruption timeline, theres a wide range of normal. Some babies and toddlers cut their first teeth very early, around 3 or 4 months old, while for other children that first tooth seems to take much longer. Though the average first tooth erupts at 6 or 7 months, some emerge at 12 months old or later. Which Baby Teeth Come in First? For many babies, the bottom front teeth (also known as lower central incisors) appear first, at around 6 to 10 months. But its also normal for the top front teeth (or upper central incisors) to come in around the same time, at 8 to 12 months. READ MORE:  Teething: Basics, Signs and Symptoms How Many Teeth Do Babies and Kids Have? By age two-and-a-half, most children have a full set of 20 primary teeth. Despite being called baby teeth, these tiny chompers stay put well past the baby years  the last of your childs primary teeth wont be replaced by permanent teeth until around age 12. Baby Teeth Chart and Order of Tooth Appearance Heres when to be on the lookout for your babys primary teeth, and roughly in what order theyll make their shining debut: Lower Central Incisor: Erupts 6-10 months Upper Central Incisor: Erupts 8-12 months Upper Lateral Incisor: Erupts 9-13 months Lower Lateral Incisor: Erupts 10-16 months Upper First Molar: Erupts 13-19 months Lower First Molar: Erupts 14-18 months Upper Canine or Cuspid: Erupts 16-22 months Lower Canine or Cuspid: Erupts 17-23 months Lower Second Molar: Erupts 23-31 months Upper Second Molar: Erupts 25-33 months Do Babies Use Their Teeth to Chew? Babys first teeth are used for biting on food (and crib rails, and toys, and fingers), not chewing, which starts when molars come in during year 2. Until then, babies primarily use their gums to mash food. Taking Care of Baby Teeth Just because theyre not permanent doesnt mean theyre not important. To  prevent cavities and keep your babys teeth healthy , make sure to  brush or clean teeth regularly , serve up nutritious and low-sugar foods and drinks, and avoid sharing spoons or other utensils so that bacteria in your mouth (or siblings mouths) dont have a chance to spread and cause decay. Schedule your  babys first dentist appointment  by the time he gets his first tooth or turns a year old, whichever comes first. Though pediatricians and dentists originally recommended that you not start your baby on fluoride toothpaste until he could spit it out, around age 3 or 4, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) now says to start babies on a tiny smear of fluoride toothpaste (about the size of a grain of rice) once they cut their first teeth and gradually work up to a pea-sized amount when they can spit it out well, around age 2-3. Does Your Baby Need Fluoride Supplements? Theres probably no need to supplement with fluoride vitamins. Babies under 6 months old dont need fluoride supplements, and older babies only need it if the local water supply isnt fluoridated, or if they just drink bottled water, which contains no fluoride. Either way, check with your pediatrician to be sure. 3 Things to Read Next: 8 Ways to Prevent Cavities in Babys Teeth Everything You Need to Know about Teething in Babies When to Visit the Dentist"

Fertility Supplements,http://www.whattoexpect.com/preconception/fertility-supplements.aspx,"No doubt many a mom-to-be has fantasized about taking a magic pill that would ensure a speedy path to pregnancy. One pill a day for a month, and voila, conception achieved! Unfortunately, a magic pregnancy pill is still far from reality. But that doesnt mean its not worth taking any pills in your quest for conception. For one thing,  prenatal vitamins  usually come in pill form and everyone agrees that popping one daily can get your body ready for baby (and possibly even make it easier to conceive). And research shows that there are also some natural fertility supplements that may help give you an extra edge in your pregnancy efforts. If youre interested in fertility supplements, be sure to talk to your practitioner before starting any of these: In This Series   Boosting Male Fertility   Fertility Foods for Men   Fertility Foods   Natural Fertility Treatments Herbal Fertility Supplements Many holistic practitioners (and happy parents) swear by the baby-making benefits of these herbal supplements: Chaste tree berry  is thought to stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) production and to help balance progesterone and estrogen levels in order to regulate the menstrual cycle. Red clover  is also thought to help balance hormone function. Plus, it contains isoflavones (estrogen-like compounds), which may promote estrogen production and enhance fertility. Siberian ginseng  is believed to regulate hormones and support uterine function. Ladys mantle  is thought to help regulate the menstrual cycle and tone the cervix. Black cohosh  is touted as improving hormone function due to its phytoestrogens (plant estrogens). The caveats:  The FDA doesnt regulate herbal fertility supplements (let alone any herbal supplements), so it can be hard to know whether the herb you buy at the store is either effective or safe. There are some reputable brands of herbs on the market, and German products tend to be reliable because German regulations on herbal supplements are stricter than those in the US, but you should talk with your practitioner before you start popping any kind of fertility supplements. Also very important: Some herbal supplements can interfere with fertility and traditional fertility medicine (including the popular herbs St. Johns Wort and Echinacea), and many of them arent safe to take during pregnancy. So youll definitely want some expert advice before you go this route. Omega-3 Fatty Acid Fertility Supplements This nutritional supplement is quickly becoming widely accepted as good for overall health, and some research shows that it may even be helpful in regulating the menstrual cycle and boosting fertility. Whats more, omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to enhance mood, which may improve fertility (stress is a known fertility buster). Even more good news: Once you do get pregnant, omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease your chances of miscarriage and preterm labor, and help promote the development of your babys brain, eyes, and nervous system. The caveats:  Theres no established optimal dose for omega-3 fatty acids  especially in the preconception period, which means it may be tricky to figure out how much you really need to take. Many prenatal vitamins (the ones you should be popping already if youre TTC since they contain essential nutrients like folic acid) contain omega-3 fatty acids, so you could already be getting a good amount. So talk with your practitioner to see if you should take extra omega-3s as fertility supplements or if you should simply add more omega-3-rich foods to your diet. The foods below are especially baby-making friendly: Omega-3-rich foods: Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and herring Shrimp Scallops Flaxseed Walnuts Tofu Omega-3 enriched eggs, yogurt, milk, and pasta"

Surprising News on Omega-3 Supplementation During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0503/surprising-news-on-omega-3-supplementation-during-pregnancy.aspx,"Summary: Taking omega-3 supplements during pregnancy does not appear to improve cognitive outcomes for children, reports surprising new research. By Marygrace Taylor | Posted: May 5, 2014 For years, moms-to-be have been told that the omega-3 fatty acids found primarily in fish oil were  the key to boosting baby brain development . Now, new findings say that omega-3 supplementation might not make a difference in child cognitive function after all, according to the followup of an Australian study published in  JAMA Pediatrics . ADVERTISING The  initial stud y , published in 2010, looked at the results of omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy on child cognition. Half of the study's 2,399 participants received daily 800-milligram supplements of fish oil, while the other half were given a placebo. At age 18 months, the children of the women who had taken fish oil supplements during pregnancy showed no difference in average cognitive, language, or motor skills compared to the placebo group. This year, researchers followed up with the children at age 4  and they still found no difference in the children's cognitive development. READ:  Foods High in Omega 3 Fatty Acids and the Best Way to Eat Them The findings contradict what many pregnant women have come to take as fact: That omega-3 supplementation can boost baby's brain health. But don't give up on fish oil supplementation during pregnancy just yet. It's a smart idea, since most women aren't eating the recommended daily intake of 200 mg of DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid that is a major structural component of the brain, skin, sperm, and retina) per day  and omega-3 fatty acids are important for more than just cognitive function. This healthy fat  decreases the risk for preterm birth and low birth weight , and is also shown to be important for eye development. ""Maybe it doesn't have the cognitive benefits that we thought, but it has other good benefits,"" says board certified OB/GYN Jennifer Lincoln, M.D. So in addition to eating one to two servings of  pregnancy-safe fish  per week, check the label on your prenatal vitamin  it should provide all the omega-3s you need (most brands contain up to 200 to 300 mg of DHA). (If you're still interested in taking an additional supplement  omega 3 or other  always check with your doctor first.) READ:  Good Fats vs. Bad Fats During Pregnancy As for boosting your baby's cognitive function? ""If you want to do something, choose to  breastfeed your baby  for as long as you can,"" Lincoln says. In another recent  JAMA Pediatrics study , nursing during the first 12 months was linked to better language understanding at age three. And by age seven, children who were breastfed scored nearly four points higher on IQ tests compared to children who were not breastfed. 3 More Things to Read: Brain-Boosting Foods for Kids Good Fats vs. Bad Fats During Pregnancy The Safest Fish to Eat During Pregnancy"
"Infant Vitamins, Fluoride Supplements, and Fluorosis",http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/librarianmommyreferencebookonparenting/infant-vitamins-fluoride-supplements-and-fluorosis,"In terms of infant vitamins, do you give your baby fluoride supplements? Should you be? The simple answer is no; you should not be giving your infant under the age of one fluoride supplements of any kind including the fluoride that is found in much of our drinking water straight from the tap. My husband and I do not give our daughter any additional fluoride nor will we be giving her fluoridated tap water until she is at least one year old if not older. In short, fluoride supplements are bad for infant teeth. But do you know why? Back in the 1950s, doctors recommended giving all babies fluoride infant vitamins. Fluoride can be good for the teeth after the teeth erupt through the gums because the mineral can help prevent cavities and tooth decay. However, the ingestion of fluoride can be harmful to the body including harmful to the teeth as the teeth form and develop under the gums. Thus, to prevent problems to the teeth as a result of fluoride consumption during development, doctors no longer recommend fluoride infant vitamins for all babies. The problem with fluoride infant vitamins is that the ingestion of fluoride can cause a condition called  fluorosis  in infant teeth. Fluorosis is a change in the appearance of the enamel of the teeth. Minor cases of fluorosis cause barely noticeable white spots on the teeth while more severe cases cause staining and pitting. Variations of the spotting depend on the severity of the fluorosis, which is caused by the amount of fluoride ingested during the development of the teeth.     Save Now On Alive!   Get Your Coupon For Any   Alive! Multi-Vitamin   FeelAlive.com       The easiest way for parents to prevent their children from developing fluorosis in both their permanent and infant teeth is to limit the amount of fluoride that their children ingest. Breastfeeding is the best way to limit exposure because breastfed infant ingest the lowest amounts of fluoride; infants who are fed formula made with fluoridated water receive the highest levels. If you formula feed your baby, use non-fluoridated formula to prepare the formula (or buy the canned, pre-made variety of formula). You should also not give your baby fluoridated water until he or she is at least one year old. Furthermore, you should avoid fluoride infant vitamins as well as fluoridated toothpaste. As for my daughter, I currently exclusively breastfeed. Once she starts solid foods, though, I will prepare her food with distilled, non-fluoridated water. She will not be getting any tap water until she is at least one. She will also not be getting any fluoride supplements. Fluorosis is fairly easy to prevent so long as you limit the amount of fluoride that your baby ingests. Not giving your baby fluoride infant vitamins is a great way to protect his or her precious infant teeth. Have you given your baby  fluoride  supplements? Are you aware of the risks?

Female Fertility Supplements – Raspberry Leaf Tea and B Complex,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/librarianmommyreferencebookonparenting/female-fertility-supplements-raspberry-leaf-tea-and-b-complex,"With my third post miscarriage period arriving today, I have decided to look more into female fertility  supplements . Although I thought that I could have possibly ovulated on January 15 based on my basal body temperatures and my cervical fluids, looking back at my entire chart at the end of my cycle leads me to believe that my third cycle after my miscarriage was anovulatory. Because I ovulated the cycle before, my best guess is that the stress of my holiday vacation to Las Vegas delayed ovulation, which ultimately messed up my entire cycle. However, because my cycles have been irregular in the past, I have decided to look into trying some supplements that might help improve female fertility. So, which female fertility supplements do I plan to try during my current menstrual cycle? The first of two female fertility supplements that I am introducing into my diet in an effort to improve female fertility is raspberry leaf tea. Safe during the entire menstrual cycle, raspberry leaves are high in flavonoids, tannins, and elagic acid as well as many vitamins and minerals including vitamins C and E and calcium. Raspberry leaf tea helps tone the uterine muscles, strengthens the uterine lining, and lengthens the luteal phase. Because of my irregular cycles and my dysmenorrhea (a medical condition of pain during menstruation that interferes with daily activities), I think that raspberry leaf tea might help me improve the quality of my uterus and uterine lining. Furthermore, if I did actually ovulate on January 15, then my luteal phase is extremely short, so the luteal phase lengthening properties of raspberry leaf tea are right up my alley. The second of the two female fertility supplements that I am adding to my diet to improve female fertility is a vitamin B complex. Although vitamin B6 is the most important B vitamin for fertility in women, all of the B vitamins are similarly important. (Vitamin B12 is the most important B vitamin for male fertility.) And, like raspberry leaf tea, vitamin B6 may help to improve female fertility by lengthening the luteal phase. Therefore, to make sure that I am ingesting an adequate amount of all the B vitamins daily, I have also started taking a B complex supplement in addition to my regular prenatal vitamin. Because the B vitamins are water-soluble, I do not have to worry about overdosing as my body excretes any excess after about eight hours. I began taking both of these female fertility supplements yesterday, the day before the first day of my current menstrual cycle. Hopefully I will see some improvement in my fertility soon!

Iron Supplements During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/week-21/pumping-iron.aspx,"What was it that made Popeye so attractive to Olive Oyl? Was it the pipe? The rakishly tipped cap? Surely what won her heart  and America's  was his obvious appreciation for iron, at least in the form of his favorite green vegetable. You may already appreciate iron yourself even if you don't gulp spinach by the can  many women pop supplements when they get their period, knowing it will make them feel more energetic. That's because your menstrual blood is rich in iron (actually, all blood is rich in iron), and running low on iron during pregnancy can make you feel like you're running on empty, especially at  21 weeks pregnant . Now that you're having a nine-month (or likely much longer) period reprieve, though, you still don't get to put those iron pills away. Even though you're not losing iron-rich blood through menstruation, you're making lots more red blood cells  and you've got to be pumped with iron to do that (as well as to feel ""strong to the finish"" of pregnancy). And your need for iron during pregnancy has never been greater than it is right now. Why the sudden need to pump it up? By week 20 in your pregnancy, your stored iron supply (the one you saved up when your periods stopped) is just about depleted  right at the time that your growing baby is most in the market for new red blood cells. This puts you at risk for  anemia during pregnancy , or low iron levels. Although all pregnant women are susceptible to anemia, those who have had other recent pregnancies, are carrying more than one fetus, or have been undernourished at any point during their pregnancies have an even greater risk. ADVERTISING Anemia is never fun  it takes away your lovely pregnancy glow, making you pale, extremely weak, easily tired or breathless, and can sometimes even lead to fainting. Don't want to go there? Here's a simple four-step plan you can follow to keep you pumped up with iron during pregnancy: Four Steps to Avoiding Anemia Step 1: Take an iron supplement during pregnancy.   Although there are plenty of ways to get iron from the foods you eat, it's always good to have extra insurance when it comes to this vital nutrient. Taking a 30 to 50 mg iron supplement during the crucial second half of your pregnancy will ensure that you're getting what you and your baby need. (If your practitioner notes that your iron stores are particularly low, he or she may recommend a higher dosage supplement.) Remember that during pregnancy, an iron supplement should be taken  in addition to  your  prenatal vitamins . Be certain to talk to your practitioner about the best time of day to take your vitamin so it's not hard on your tummy; there are also different kinds of iron supplements to try (some are slow release) if they're giving you digestive unrest. Step 2: Eat yer spinach!   Popeye said a mouthful  a mouthful you should consider, too. If spinach isn't appealing (though think out of the can here  you can also serve spinach up fresh in a salad with sliced strawberries, wilted under seared fish or grilled meat, or sauted with pasta and cheese), there are lots of other iron-rich foods you can pump your diet up with, including lean beef or buffalo, duck, cooked dried beans, edamame and other soy products, oat bran, barley, dried fruit, Jerusalem artichokes, and seaweed. Sardines, clams, oysters, mussels, and shrimp also contain a lot of iron, but pregnant women need to be cautious about seafood and  fish during pregnancy  because of the mercury content. These seafoods have low levels of mercury, but limit your intake to 12 ounces a week at most. Also, be especially careful not to eat raw seafood  for example, clams, oysters, and mussels must be cooked until their shells open, and shrimp must be cooked until its milky white. Step 3. Keep your caffeine down.   Caffeine may perk you up, but it dashes the effects of iron. If you wash down that iron-rich steak with a cola (or that bag of trail mix with a coffee), you're reducing the amount of iron that gets absorbed into your system (plus it's best to limit  caffeine during pregnancy  anyway). Step 4. Let vitamin C work in your favor.   Vitamin C is iron's best bud (apart from Popeye), since it's well known to improve iron absorption. So take a glass of OJ with that iron supplement during pregnancy, a side of red pepper with those shrimp, or some fresh strawberries in your oat bran cereal.

Pumping at Work Doesn’t Have to “Suck”,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/what-pumping-taught-me,"I could not have prepared myself for the challenges that came with pumping breast milk while I was at work, away from my twin babies. I had the best breast pump , a comfortable chair, a private room, and a supportive boss. But the stress and emotions I felt about the whole process proved most difficult.  SEE ALSO: Pumping Breast Milk 101 I had already been experiencing low milk supplyone breast produced much more milk than the other. This was worrisome because I had twins and needed as much milk as possible. I did all the things I could do to increase milk supply and did see small results. Still, pumping and seeing exactly what was in that bottle when I was finished was a stark reminder that it wasnt enough. I had to remind myself that breastfeeding didnt have to be all or nothing. This was the amount I was able to produce, and this is what I was going to feed my babies, along with supplementing . I learned I needed to make peace with that and to go easy on myself. This was just one of many challenges the kids and I would most certainly get through.     Advanced Skin Cancer Med   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       The growing doubt I felt about returning to work only made pumping worse. I had a job that I loved and worked with some of the smartest and most inspiring women, but I couldnt help but fear I was doing wrong by my children. I wanted to be with them, but the reality was that I had to work. So, I made it my mission to not torture myself with that decision, and to be the best working mom that I personally could be.  And, for me, that meant continuing to pump at work and staying connected to my kids even when I was away from them.  Even when hooked up to the pump with its low moan whirring sound and fluctuating pitch, I learned to stop paying attention to each drop filling the bottles and instead direct my thoughts to my babies. I replayed moments in my mind--like how the night before my son fell asleep at my breast while nursing or how my daughter scooted across the floor backwards with the sweetest grin on her face. These moments, even when I was away from my kids, were still about them. And focusing on them helped me to relax, destress, and find peace so that I could produce as much milk as possible. The more I pumped at work, the more it became second nature to me. (Okay, well, not that having a battery-operated device strapped to my chest was ever truly second nature, but the act of it became easier, more comfortable.) Id think about my babies, send a text to our sitter to see how they were doing, look at photos of them I recently took, and even found some time to work. I got into a rhythm with my breast pump, mastering a multi-tasking racket of responding to work emails, while still having a piece of my mind and heart on my kids. Its kind of what happens when we enter the motherhood. We learn to juggle so many things at once and somehow, eventually, we get it all done. MORE: Tips for Pumping Breast Milk Pumping, like so many parts of being a mom, teaches us acceptance. We learn what we can or cannot do and work around it, figuring out ways to make our lives the best they can be without getting down about the things we cannot change. We learn patience in its truest form, not only with our babies, but also with ourselves.

Italian Parents Could Land in Jail for Raising Their Kids Vegan,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/italian-parents-could-land-in-jail-for-raising-their-kids-vegan,"As if it isnt hard enough to feed your kids, what with picky eating and all, a member of the Italian parliament is raising the stakes. Elivira Savino wants to make it illegal for parents to raise their kids vegan. Her proposed law would put parents at risk of jail time for feeding their kids ""a diet devoid of elements essential for healthy and balanced growth,"" which Savino says can include veganism. Savino, who eats meat but not too much, proposed the law, which applies to parents of kids under 16 years old. If passed, parents could be put in jail for up to one year for simply feeding their kids a vegan diet, up to four years if the child develops permanent health problems, and up to seven years if the child dies from nutritional complications. Penalties would be more severe for parents of vegan kids under 3. ""I have nothing against vegans or veganism as long as it is a free choice by adults,"" Savino told Reuters . ""I just find it absurd that some parents are allowed to impose their will on children in an almost fanatical, religious way, often without proper scientific knowledge or medical consultation. Do-it-yourself on these matters terrorizes me."" Salvino said she devised this law following  an incident last month  in Milan, when a 1-year-old boy was hospitalized for weighing the same amount as the average 3 month-old because, doctors said, he was fed a vegan diet.  According to an Italian newspaper , it was the fourth hospitalization of a vegan child in the country within 18 months. The Salvinos proposed law is expected to be brought to Italys parliament floor for debate this year. How you choose to feed your child can be a complicated and very personal choice, and adding potential jailtime into the mix doesn't make it any easier. Still, Savino does make at least the semblance of a valid point: When you make any big nutritional decision, consult your childs doctor. And certainly if your choices mean that your baby is failing to thrive, as in the recent case of the 1-year-old Milanese boy, you should be held responsible. But to punish attentive parents for a personal decision seems like a classic case of (yes, maybe well-intentioned) government stepping into matters where it doesnt have a right or even the expertise to be. So is it safe to  raise your child vegan ? Yes, say expertsprovided youre extra careful with your food choices and plan meals with the help of your child's pediatrician. And follow the  guidelines for vegan toddlers , including: Breastfeeding baby for at least the first 12 months of life, exclusively for the first 6 Serving only whole (not refined) grains Serving tofu, beans and other veggie protein sources, and healthy fats, like avocadoes as well as Offering vitamin supplements in consultation with your doctor, if necessary Keeping an eye on babys weight, and offer more calories if shes not gaining enough"

Vegan Toddler Hospitalized Because Parents Ignored This Rule of Kids and Alternative Diets,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/0711/vegan-toddler-hospitalized-because-his-parents-didnt-know-this-about-alternative-diets,"A 14-month-old Italian boy, whose parents kept him on a vegan diet, was hospitalized earlier this month with severe malnutrition. He weighed only 5 kg, or 11 lbs, the same as an average 3 month-old. The boy, living in Milan with his mom and dad, was not given any dietary supplements, which lowered his calcium levels to ""the minimum needed to survive,""  Italian paper  The Local  reports , and aggravated a heart condition (not caused by his diet) to the point that he required emergency surgery. He's recovering well. Following the surgery, hospital staff reported his condition to social services because they said his parents refused to give him a more complete diet even after doctors asked them to. A local court has placed him in the custody of the hospital until the investigation of his parents is complete.     Stage 3 Inoperable Cancer   Find Info on a Treatment Option   for Advanced Skin Cancer.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       If  you and your toddler are vegetarian  or vegan, this story probably pisses you off  and rightfully so. To some, these parents, along with  several   similar   ones , will give meat- and meat-product-free families a bad rap. But the truth is plenty of parents raise healthy children with alternative diets because they take care to still meet  all  of their baby's nutritional needs. No one knows for sure what drove the parents of this little boy to make their dietary choices or exactly what they were feeding him, but it's clear they were not following guidelines and compromised his wellbeing as a result. ""It is not a problem to choose different or unusual kinds of nutrition, and we certainly do not want to enter into a discussion of the merits of the decision,""  said Luca Bernardo, the hospital's pediatric director . ""But since birth, the baby should have had support in this case with calcium and iron."" So what are the  recommendations for raising a child on a vegan diet ? First, as long as his or her eating patterns are well-planned, know that veganism and vegetarianism are ""perfectly healthy for infants and toddlers,"" according to the  American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics . Just follow medical recommendations and consult with your pediatrician along the way. Next, doctors still recommend breast milk as the main (or only) source of nutrition for the first 6 months of baby's life. If you do not  breastfeed , opt for iron-fortified formula, which comes in soy if you're vegan. When baby is 4 to 6 months or older, you can  introduce solids  in pretty much the same way you would for a non-vegan or -vegetarian child. Try tofu or beans instead of meat and soy yogurt and cheese. If you're vegan, you may want to consider breastfeeding for more than a year (the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization). Wean with soy-milk formula fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Don't use milk alternatives (soy, rice, almond) during baby's first year. The most important part of feeding your baby or toddler a vegan or vegetarian diet, which can have serious health consequences if ignored, is getting your children enough of the nutrients that normally come from meat and dairy. These are: Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Protein and Fiber. Although this story is heartbreaking and even infuriating to some, these parents do not represent all vegan or vegetarian parents or this lifestyle. Feed your child however you feel is best; just don't confuse your beliefs with their needs."

Is Homemade Baby Food Really Healthier for Infants?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/homemade-baby-food-healthier-infants/,"Between the planning, meal prep, work it requires to cook it to babys liking, babys picky appetite and babys tendency to put much of their food anywhere except in their mouths, its not surprising many parents dont crank out babys meals in-house themselves. But a new study published in the  International Journal of Obesity  is saying homemade baby food is the way to go. In fact, it may even produce leaner babies with more diverse diets than store-bought baby food. What the study looked at Researchers examined the diets of 65 infants. They assessed their body fat percentage from exams taken when they were 6, 9, 12 and 36 months old to determine whether the source of the baby food  homemade or commercially produced  influenced, in any way, their growth and weight. They found that by 9 months old, 22 percent of the infants had exclusively received homemade food and approximately the same percentage had received exclusively store-bought food. The majority of babies had received a combination of both homemade and store-bought. While there werent major differences in the infants lengths or weight at this age, researchers did find that the infants getting only homemade food were covering more of the seven different food groups than the babies only eating store-bought foods.     Melanoma Therapy   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       At 12 months old, however, researchers began to see significant differences in the percentage of body fat in the infants; the percentage was higher in those consuming only store-bought foods. What the research found While the study was relatively small and involved limitations, including relying on parents to accurately recall and report how the babies were fed, the study did find that babies who ate a diet of only homemade foods were exposed to more diverse foods earlier in life and had lower body fat mass by the time they were 1 to 3 years old. What this means for parents Theres no way around it   making homemade baby food  is certainly more time-consuming and involves more planning than purchasing brand varieties at your local grocery store. But there are some benefits in addition to the potential health perks it provides to your child. You know exactly what youre feeding your baby.  There will be no need to put on your reading glasses to check the ingredients on the tiny labels. When youre the chef, you know what youre putting into your babys food. There are so many tools available to simplify the process.  From blenders to freezer trays and small glass containers, there are so many products on the market that help ease the cooking, planning and prepping process for parents. You might even save money.  Store-bought baby food can be pricey  especially when youre going the all-organic and all-natural route. Plus, when you cut out the container cost and prices involved in keeping it on store shelves, you might even save money by cooking it at home and reusing your own containers. Making your own baby food Ideally, you want to stock up on  loads of fresh fruits and veggies   frozen is fine as long as you read the ingredients closely to avoid brands with added sugar or salt. If you have a blender, its easy to toss in flavors your babys used to  for example, carrots or sweet potatoes (also naturally sweet so picky eaters are more likely to munch on them). But the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends holding off on gas-causing cruciferous veggies like broccoli and cauliflower until your little one is 10 to 12 months old.

SPONSORED: 4 Ways to Help Baby Sleep Well Through the Night,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ways-to-help-baby-sleep-well-through-the-night/,"Paid for and provided by Pampers Before you brought your baby home, you may not have realized just how much you love sleep. Your baby, on the other hand? Well, lets just say that he or she would rather do anything than rest those weary eyes at night. How can you help your baby learn to look forward to sleepingand stay asleep? Try these helpful strategies. Create a Bedtime Routine Dont expect it to run like clockwork at first, but  establishing a calming and consistent bedtime routine  can set the stage in the long run for encouraging your baby to slip smoothly into dreamland. Once you learn to anticipate when he or she is naturally tired (but ideally not overtired), put aside 20 minutes for a soothing bath, final feeding, gentle rocking and a lullaby. Dress Baby for Comfort With all those adorable prints and super-snuggly materials, babys sleepytime wardrobe can make you wish you were a wee thing again yourself. What your baby wears to bed should first and foremost be functional, comfortable and safeinside and out. Start with a fresh diaper, like Pampers, that is absorbent to keep baby dry, and stretchy to provide a snug, comfortable fit. Avoid overdressing baby (no hats or extra clothing), and keep baby warm and cozy in a sleep sack thats the right size to allow baby to flex her elbows and knees.   Prep for a Safe Snooze Once your baby goes down, you will finally have some me time (youve earned it, mama!). Enjoy these precious and restorative moments worry-free by making certain babys sleeping area adheres to  safety standards . The mattress baby rests on should be clean and firmand fit tightly within his or her bed. The sheet you use to cover the mattress should also fit securely. Any fluffy bedding, blankets, pillows, wedges, sleep positioners, bumper pads, stuffed animals or toys should be left out of the space. And always put baby to sleep on his or her back. If youre swaddling, make sure the blanket is not wrapped too tightly around babys hips, and stop swaddling before baby begins trying to roll over on her own (around two months is a good cut off time). Eliminate Slumber Busters Now that baby is catching those zzzzs, make it last. While there are slumber busters youll never be able to controlteething and colds as a startthere are others you can anticipate. Keep babys room at a comfortable temperature, making sure its well-ventilated and cool. Never smoke in your babys room; in fact, smoking should never happen anywhere near your baby. Keep the noise level at a minimum. Complete and total silence isnt goldenafter all, your newborn is accustomed to your stomachs gurgles and the beat of your heart. But some soft background soundslow music, the hum of a fan or a white noise machinecan work wonders for sustaining sleep, especially if you live in a loud setting. Just be sure to place any noise generating machine at least 6 feet away from babys bed and keep it on the lowest setting. Finally, keep the lights dimand consider adding blackout shades to prevent the early morning sun from waking baby up before theyve gotten their needed amount of shut-eye.

Eating Well in the First Trimester,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well-menu/first-trimester.aspx,"Between early pregnancy nausea, food aversions, and fatigue, eating may be the last thing on your mind these days.

Those “Well-Meaning” Comments About Pregnant Bodies,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/well-meaning-comments-about-pregnant-bodies,"Everyone knows that if you get a kick out of watching strangers (and sometimes even casual acquaintances) say dumb things and make complete fools of themselves, then you should definitely get pregnant. Because this happens to pregnant women all the time. Theres just something about bringing new life into the world that attracts ridiculous comments  you know what Im talking about. Things like, Are you sure it isnt twins? Or, Wow! Are you due tomorrow? Or, Should you be drinking a fourth whiskey cocktail in your condition? (Jokes, friends! No one is drinking whiskey cocktails, or alcoholic cocktails of any kind for that matter,  because drinking alcohol is not recommended during pregnancy .) SEE ALSO:  How Much Weight You Should Gain During Pregnancy     Psoriatic Arthritis   Living With PsA Could Mean Living   With Joint Damage. Learn More Now.   www.PsoriaticInfo.com       So, yeah, the rude comments can be annoying. But then there are those other comments  comments that most likely are well-meaning and coming from a good place but still make a pregnant woman go from being friendly and confident to paranoid and self-conscious in a hot second. Especially if shes overtired or having a particularly huge day, then a perfectly innocuous comment like the ones below can seem like a cruel insult, punishable only by mockery on the Internet. Here are some comments that seem benign but may send a sensitive pregnant woman into a downward spiral in the blink of an eye. Proceed at your own risk! You dont look pregnant  just like you had a really big lunch.  Many a loving partner has uttered this very statement, intending it as a compliment. But guess what: Human babies are beautiful; burrito babies are not. A simple, You look great, sweetie! would be much more appreciated. Better yet, just be quiet and buy her lunch. Alternatively Wow, you really popped!  What seems sudden and dramatic and worthy of enthusiastic statements that end in an exclamation point to you might not go over so well with a pregnant woman who has been uncomfortable for months (and may still have a few to go). Plus, popped? Really? Its a womans stomach, not bubble wrap. Surely there are other, more gentle verbs. Are you pregnant?  I know the overly curious barista who asked me this the other day was just being friendly. (OK, fine. He wasnt the barista. He works at the gelato shop...and, yes, I was eating gelato. Again. In the middle of winter. Judge away!) Still, this isnt always a harmless or comfortable question. Because what if the answer was no and my baby bump was really a gelato bump? Best to play it safe and wait until the pregnant woman shares her news with you. I cant believe youre still wearing heels.  Do you covet my heels? In which case, yay! Or are you afraid Im going to tip over? Please clarify. Immediately! I can tell youre having a girl because youre big everywhere, not just in the stomach. Im sure of it!  I know Im having a boy. I know this because my OB looked at the ultrasound and told me. But enough about the gender  would you say this bigness you speak of is more flabby big or a jiggle-y big? Your skin looks amazing!  My friends and family know to tread lightly around me when it comes to comments about my pregnant belly. Lately, theyve been focused on my skin, which was flattering at first until I started wondering: Are they talking about my skin to draw attention away from my huge thighs? Whats so different about my skin? Was my skin bad before and thats why they are over-complimenting it now? (I will let you know the answers to all these pressing questions after I get back from the dermatologist tomorrow.) which just goes to show, friends:  That almost every comment about the physical side of pregnancy can be misconstrued and misinterpreted given the right mood and circumstances. So whats really going on here  are there too many sensitive pregnant women, or too many people making dumb comments? I think both sides should share the responsibility. I, myself, am adding Chill out! to my to-do list (right below Invest in flats and Figure out gelatos guy work schedule in order to avoid any future interactions). Any fellow oversensitive pregnant moms are welcome to join me. MORE:  12 Best Foods to Eat When Youre Pregnant In the meantime, my advice to well-meaning but nave non-pregnant bystanders is this: Tell her shes beautiful, that youre excited for her, that you cant wait to meet her baby. But leave all discussion of body parts between the neck and the knees (or, in my case, anything except the eyebrows) completely out of it.

Conjoined Twin Girls Successfully Separated and Doing Well,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/1120/conjoined-twin-girls-successfully-separated-and-doing-well,"Most pregnancies and births progress with minor or no complications , but on the rare chance that something happens that you and your doctor need to talk through, this inspirational story of two twin girls shows that there's always hope. The girls were born eight weeks ago at Norton Hospital in Kentucky and were conjoined at the chest and abdomen,  according to a press release from Kosair Children's Hospital . (If your due date is looming and you're worried about this happening to you, don't be; conjoined twins are very rare, affecting about one in 200,000 live births, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, doctors know the twins are conjoined by the second trimester.)        Get Info on an FDA Approved Treatment      The twins spent their first several weeks of life with an extensive team of doctors and nurses in a  neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)  at Kosair Children's Hospital. And despite best efforts, they began to have trouble breathing and stopped growing at a normal rate. So doctors decided to operate. On November 11, Kosair Children's staff performed its first separation of conjoined twins since 2001. The surgery was projected to take 12 hours because  the sisters shared a liver and vital heart structures , but in reality, it only took eight. The 45-member team, includingcardiovascular and pediatric surgeons, anesthesiologists,biomedical and engineering specialists, a radiologist, advanced surgical nurses and more, had prepared by practicing on dolls. The girls are in the hospital's critical care center for kids and are recovering well against the odds, doctors say. (Only between 5 and 25 percent of conjoined twins survive.) They're still on ventilators, but they're getting noticeably stronger, and though docs have yet to decide on a long-term prognosis, signs point to the girls' continued improvement. One or both of the girls might need surgery again in the future, but their doctors and parents are optimistic. ""God was definitely watching over the girls and the medical team on the day of the surgery,"" their mother said. ""We are so thankful to God and everyone at Kosair Childrens Hospital for getting them this far."" 3 Things to Read Next: Women in U.S. May Soon Be Giving Birth with Someone Else's Uterus Why Most Moms Will Relate to Kim K's Feelings About Her Second Birth 4 Incredible Preemie Survival Stories"

4 Well-Known Baby Brands Doing Something Completely Different This Season,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/1019/well-known-baby-brands-doing-something-completely-different-this-season,"If you've spent any time buying or researching baby gear (and you could spend countless hours doing both!), then you probably have your trusted brands for certain types of products, like Britax for car seats and WubbaNubs for all things plush and pacifiers. But at this year's ABC Kids Expo 2015, a number of established baby brands challenged parents' perceptions about exactly what they're capable of by revealing new products that might not seem like a natural fit. So what tempts a company like Boppy, known for its nursing pillows, to try out a skin care line? It's all about figuring out what mom and baby need and providing it in a way only your company can, Bobby reps say. Boppy is all about supporting mom, and what's more supportive than helping eliminate stretch marks? Here are four companies exploring a surprising new side of the baby product market  as well as when their products will be available so you can decide if you think the risk paid off. 1. Boppy Boppy Bloom  is a line of skin care products that Boppy created using feedback from real moms. It includes stretch mark cream, belly butter, breast balm and a body oil from ingedients like cocoa butter and oat oil. They're already available online and run from $10 to $15. 2. aden + anais This beloved muslin maker  has had an eventful year when it comes to experimentation. It  launched its first line of clothing over the summer , and by the end of November, it will have a new line of nursing pillows and plush toys on the shelves. Muslin covers are available for the nursing pillows for $15 and the stuffed animals come holding a wrap  still, it's an unusual expansion for a company whose founding mission was to bring muslin swaddling blankets to American babies. 3. Skip Hop Diaper bags are Skip Hop's bread and butter, though it now sells toys, mobiles and kids' bags, to name a few. But what's especially new and surprising this year is Skip Hop's bouncer, available in May 2016. Furniture is new to the brand, which focuses mostly on accessories to big ticket items, like strollers. That said, the item wowed with its adjustable height, which showed the creativty the brand's known for. 4. Baby Bjorn When you think Baby Bjorn, you think baby carrier. Of course, the Swedish brand also makes travel cribs and bouncers, but on-the-go is the name of its game. So what's the newest addition?  A unisex diaper bag . Baby Bjorn's had diaper bags before, but this is the first one on the shelves in 10 years, reps say, because it caters to parents in a way others didn't. It can be worn as backpack, has plenty of storage space and a bright colored lining, making items easy to find. Which product do you think is the biggest leap?

Child Well Being Ranked State by State,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/family-life/0412/child-well-being-ranked-state-by-state.aspx,"Which state is the best place to raise children? For the first time, the Foundation for Child Development (FCD), aided by data from  The KIDS COUNT Project  by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, has ranked the child well-being for individual U.S. states (rather than for the country as a whole) in a report titled,  Analyzing State Differences in Child Well-Being . And the winner is... New Jersey. Massachusetts was a clear second. New Hampshire, Utah, Connecticut, and Minnesota weren't too far behind. The broad quality-of-life measure is based on 25 indicators of well-being, grouped within seven ""domains"" that include: economic conditions; health; education; community engagement; emotional and spiritual well-being;  social relations ; and safety. The six states with the worst scores are New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Nevada, and Arizona. The majority of states (33 out of 50) show improved child well-being between the data's time span of 2003 to 2007. Hawaii, West Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania showed the most improvement. The states with the most deterioration of child well-being between 2003 and 2007 are Connecticut, South Dakota, Kansas, and Maine. A good example of state differences is support for public education, which is by far the largest program for children and is largely driven by state and local funds and decision making. Per-pupil expenditures ranged from $6,951 in Idaho to $17,620 in New Jersey in 2007. In conclusion, the study has this to say about their findings: ""Our analysis shows that child well-being is related to state and local tax rates, level of TANF (welfare) benefits, per-pupil expenditures on elementary and secondary education, and access to public medical insurance programs. This is an important finding given the recent economic downturn and resultant pressures on state budgets. As state leaders attempt to balance budgets, it is important that they do not compromise the country's future by shortchanging children."" What role do you think government should play in improving our children's overall well-being? Do you think government should decrease, increase, or at least hold-steady funding for those programs which directly effect our children's well-being? Photo credit:  Flickr"
Too Tired to Cook: Tips to Eat Well With MS,,
My Top Two Tips for Getting Toddlers to Eat Well,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/my-top-two-tips-for-getting-toddlers-to-eat-well.aspx,"Vanessa Bronder Alward is a work-from-home mother of three boys, 11 and under, and married to a chef. She realized that her kids seemed the anomaly because they ate many vegetables and large varieties of foods. She figured her method of feeding her children was the key so she decided to share with others  hoping to positively influence parents for their children's future health. Her blog,  My Kids Really Eat This , was started to help inspire others to get kids to eat well.   Visit her site for recipes, tips and insight or follow Vanessa on  Twitter .   I don't know how it started, but at some point friends would call me up, asking me how to prepare different foods, which product I recommended for their kids, or how I got my kids to eat such and such. But I wasn't always in the advice-giving role, especially in the beginning of motherhood. In fact, when my first son was born I was as anxious as any other new mom. I read books, listened to my own mom, and asked other friends for advice. But soon I started figuring out what worked best for me and my babies. There are so many pressures and expectations on new parents on doing the right thing. As new parents, we are very nervous and concerned with safety, maybe sometimes overly concerned. We  all  check in on our babies their first nights home  listen to make sure they're still actually breathing. Moms have an innate desire to make sure our children live past childhood, and we will do so much to ensure that. But sometimes it's hard to know when to let them try things that may potentially harm them and when we're doing the right thing.        Learn How to Manage Your Plaque Psoriasis      This is true also when feeding them. I found that one scary part of being a fairly new mom was introducing solid foods to my son's diet. I don't mean pured baby foods or cereals, but  solid  pieces of food. I was so scared he would choke and keel over in front of me. One day I was with my good friend, who had a son just two weeks younger than my then seven-month-old, and she gave her son Cheerios. I remember being amazed at her confidence that her son could eat them    especially since we'd just introduced ""solid"" foods at six months per the doctors' and the baby books' recommendations (he'd been exclusively breast fed until then). My friend reassured me that he'd survive. And so I gave it a whirl and my son loved them. It was fun watching my son try to pick up the individual pieces with his chubby fingers and plop them into his mouth. Of course, the Cheerios and other melt-away toddler snacks led to more and more foods like cubes of soft fruits and vegetables, pasta, and meats. Eventually he even ate smaller pieces of whatever we made for the adults, too. And then he ate exactly what we were eating (but just in smaller portions). I took this cue from my own mother by not making separate meals. And, this is one of my top tips to new moms:  Feed them what you eat (as long as it's not overly processed junk food). Don't just give them what you  think  they will eat . Kids learn to like more foods this way, especially the green vegetables, and are more likely to get the vitamins and minerals they need to grow into healthy children then adults. Proper nutrition is important for their long-term health. And, another tip to get them to eat well:  Eat with them  at the same time, at the same table . I can hear the following objections, ""But my husband/partner doesn't get home until later and I want to eat with him/her"". So, eat with the baby/toddler/child and prepare and reheat a plate for your partner . ( Hopefully, he or she already eats all their vegetables and a wide variety of foods!) Or, sit down with your child with a glass of wine or a dessert for yourself while they eat. On the weekends, eat together as a family. Trust me, this gets kids to eat more than just mac and cheese and chicken nuggets. Parenting is a balancing act  learning when to relax and when to step up our protection so that our kids grow up healthfully. You can read the books, listen to friends and family, and trust your instincts! In the meantime, try to do right by them and not beat yourself up when you make mistakes. Because trust me, you will. And they'll be okay."
Labor Procedures and Interventions,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/labor-and-delivery/procedures-and-interventions.aspx,"What would your best-case childbirth scenario look like? Chances are, it would go something like this: a manageably short labor (which of course starts with perfectly timed contractions that are easily pegged as the real thing), little pain (or at least nothing some well-orchestrated breathing exercises couldn't handle), a few pushes, and then a beautiful baby to welcome into the world. And happily, many labor and deliveries  especially for those women who are at low risk for complications  end up pretty close to that scenario (well, except maybe for the little pain part). But sometimes, despite the hopes and best-laid plans of expectant women and their practitioners, things don't go quite that smoothly  or naturally. Sometimes, nature ends up needing a little help in the form of a medical intervention  whether it's something to nudge labor along or even get labor started such as the administration of Pitocin or the artificial rupture of membranes, an instrument (forceps, vacuum) or procedure (episiotomy) to help ease a baby out, or fetal monitoring (internal or external) to make sure a baby is weathering the stresses of labor well. In This Series   pregnancy Labor and Delivery Procedures: Artificial Rupture of...   pregnancy Labor and Delivery Procedures: Electronic Fetal Monitoring   pregnancy Forceps During Delivery   pregnancy Labor and Delivery Procedures: Labor Augmentation   pregnancy Labor Induction   pregnancy Routine IV During Labor Even if your pregnancy is low-risk and all indications are that your labor will progress uneventfully (or even if your  birth plan  specifies no interventions or you're delivering at home with a midwife who won't even have access to these types of procedures), it's still important to be familiar with them. Why? First, because understanding what they entail takes the mystery and anxiety out of them  which would make undergoing one less unsettling. You never know what labor and delivery might bring (your uncomplicated home birth might end up becoming a little more tricky than you envisioned, necessitating a hospital birth in the end, for example). Giving some thought in advance to the possibility of these interventions may help you cope with them more effectively. Second, you still may be able to have some control over how these procedures are applied  especially if you discuss them with your practitioner ahead of time, and spell out your preferences regarding them in your birth plan. And finally, being prepared for the unexpected is an expectant mom's best policy, and something you'll do well to remember once you become a parent!. The good news? Most interventions are used less now than in the past  those that were routine just five or 10 years ago are currently used only on an as-needed basis. And as of January 2017, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises against rushing into interventions like premature labor induction or augmentation for women with low-risk pregnancies who are progressing normally through labor and whose babies are in good shape, instead suggesting practitioners delay or tweak some of these tactics unless or until they're absolutely necessary. This means you're more likely than ever to have your best-case birthing scenario play out."
Eating Well When You're Too Nauseated to Eat,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well-menu/nauseated.aspx,"Finding yourself in a morning-sickness cycle  you're too nauseated to eat, but not eating's making you more nauseated? Break out of the cycle by becoming a grazer. Eating small portions throughout the day keeps your tummy a little bit full  and a little bit full is the best way for a queasy tummy to be. Here are some menu suggestions and easy-to-make recipes for comforting, bland, yet super-nutritious foods to get you through a full day of the misnamed malady, ""morning sickness""  including some tried-and-sometimes-true foods that quell the queasiness, such as ginger, mint, and fresh lemon.

Biophysical Profile (BPP),http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/prenatal-testing-biophysical-profile/,"The biophysical profile (BPP) is another assessment of fetal well-being that's often done when other tests (like the  nonstress test ) require follow-up. When all of the measurements are normal, baby is most likely doing fine. If any of these are unclear, further testing may be offered to provide a more accurate picture of baby's condition. In This Series   pregnancy Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT)   pregnancy Amniocentesis   pregnancy Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)   pregnancy Glucose Screening and Glucose Tolerance Test   pregnancy Group B Strep Testing During Pregnancy   pregnancy Initial Blood Workup Who a biophysical profile is for Moms who are carrying  twins or multiples  and have certain risk factors, as well as those with conditions such as  high blood pressure ,  type 2 diabetes  or heart disease may have this test. You may also have it if  your due date has zoomed by.  Physicians often order the biophysical profile to determine if it's time to  induce labor . When a biophysical profile is done The BPP is most common in the  third trimester. How a biophysical profile is done A BPP monitors the fetal heart rate (similar to a  nonstress test ) and is accompanied by a special ultrasound similar to a  level 2 ultrasound . But rather than looking at organs and measurements, the test generally evaluates five aspects of life in the uterus: Fetal breathing:  How your baby's chest moves as she makes practice breaths of amniotic fluid. Fetal heart rate:  The number of beats per minute of your baby's heart. Fetal movement:  Movements observed over a 30-minute period, sometimes longer if baby's napping. Fetal tone:  The ability to flex and extend an arm or leg, measured by counting quick, jerky movements. Volume of amniotic fluid:  The amount of amniotic fluid surrounding your baby. What do BPP test results mean? Your sonographer will give a biophysical profile score of 0 to 2 in each of the above categories. A biophysical profile score of 8 to 10 is ""reassuring,"" though the test may be repeated later on. A score of 6 may require a second BPP within 12 to 24 hours, or, depending on how far along you are in your pregnancy, your baby may be delivered. A score of 4 or less may mean you need additional tests (like a contraction stress test or vibroacoustic stimulation) or that your baby might need to be delivered right away. Keep in mind that even if the score is considered ""normal,"" low levels of amniotic fluid means more monitoring needs to be done and, in some cases, delivery may be necessary. Risks There are no risks to you or your baby associated with a biophysical profile. The ""modified"" biophysical profile The ""modified"" biophysical profile is a more efficient version of the BPP that combines the nonstress test with an evaluation of the quantity of amniotic fluid. A low level of amniotic fluid may indicate that a baby is not producing enough urine and  the placenta  may not be functioning up to par. If your baby reacts appropriately to the nonstress test and levels of amniotic fluid are adequate, it's likely that all is well.

While her speech focused on the moral imperatives at stake, she has elsewhere  offered specific legal grounds  for prosecuting war criminals as well as clear next steps for bringing the guilty to justice. Among the many things you could say about Clooney'sspeech: That she's an incredibly emotional and powerful speaker. That she's doing difficult work that not many people can or want to do. That her persistent efforts are admirable. And that it must be so, so hard to hear the testimonies of young girls who have been been subjected to such devastating abuse, as a human being and as a mother-to-be.

""Entertainment Tonight"" led with the style rather than the substance in their headline too: ""Amal Clooney Stuns in Yellow While Delivering Passionate Speech at the United Nations."" To be fair, the reaction to this type of coverage (which, let's remember, was of a pregnant woman just showing up and doing her job, because  of course she did ), was  swift and intense . Try to imagine George doing the same speech. While you probably have no problem imagining how good he looked doing it, it's pretty hard to picture  any  news outlet focusing on his Armani suit or how well he's hiding his sympathy bump from too much pre-baby ice cream.

Pregnant AmalClooneyno surprise herelooks amazing just about every time she steps out. But this kind of one-dimensional coverage seems to imply that when an expecting mom holds down a kickass job, it's less important than whether she looked amazing while doing it. And this mentality is pervasive, even if we dont intend for it to be. In scanning for news to report on today, I saw this story. I hesitated on whether we, too, should cover it, and it didn't even occur to me at first that the fashion angle was all wrong. We're all so used to seeing these kinds of stories (and, no guilt intended, enjoying them) that we dont even bat an eye that how Amal dressed her bump is all we can talk about. I know I couldn't pull off what Amal diddoesevery day, especially while carrying two babies. She's an amazing role model and something to aspire to. Yes, her shoes are fierce.

Swelling After C-Section -- Well that's interesting,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/parentingtwodaughtersonzerosleep/swelling-after-csection-well-thats-interesting,"I had c-sections with both of my pregnancies and I carried relatively small during both of them. Luckily immediately after my c sections my belly was completely gone. I was very surprised to see that happen for sure, but happen of course. I did have some swelling after the c-section right at the incision though. After both of my c-sections I was very curious to see what the incision looked like, more so after my first one but even after the second I wanted to see what horrific scar I was going to be left with. The incision is not very big and my doctor did a really good job with it actually. I had a good deal of swelling after the c section on and around the incision which was interesting to say the least but I assumed that I would have some considering I had just been completely cut open and had a human ripped from my body! When I was in the hospital I had packed my own clothes for the stay and although they fit they were tight right around the incision and I couldn't have anything rub against it because it hurt! I had staples to close up the incision from the c section and that was definitely a weird feeling because of the swelling after the c section and the numbness that was around the incision from cutting nerves they just felt strange, they didnt hurt at all by any means but it was odd because every time I would move it seemed like I felt them there. With my first c-section I was in the hospital for four days so I had the staples removed the day I was discharged, which didnt hurt one bit but I was still a little swollen and it looked like I had some strange little pouch going on there and I guess my doctor must have noticed that I was looking at it worried and assured me that it was still healing and it would go back to normal. Now my kids are 2  and 17 months and my scar is hardly noticeable, its not dark in color and there is obviously no more swelling at all. As a matter of fact I hardly even notice it anymore its just become a part of my body and it seems weird to think that Ive only had it for a few years.

The Nonstress Test During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/prenatal-testing-nonstress-test/,"A nonstress test (NST) measures fetal heart rate and response to movement in the third trimester to ensure your baby's doing well and getting enough oxygen.  In This Series   pregnancy Noninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT)   pregnancy Amniocentesis   pregnancy Biophysical Profile   pregnancy Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)   pregnancy Glucose Screening and Glucose Tolerance Test   pregnancy Group B Strep Testing During Pregnancy Who the nonstress test during pregnancy is for A nonstress test is generally ordered when a mom has a complication like  gestational diabetes  or  preeclampsia  or a procedure like  amniocentesis.  You also might get one if your baby is measuring small for his gestational age or isn't very active. And you might have an NST if your due date passes but your baby stays put. When you might get a nonstress test An NST is done in the  third trimester of pregnancy,  from week 28 on. What happens during a nonstress test A stretchy belt monitor will be placed around your belly (the same kind  doctors often use during labor and delivery ). No mindless magazine-flipping for you  you've got a job to do: You'll be asked to keep track of each movement you feel baby make. You may hold a clicker contraption (like a buzzer on  Jeopardy ) and each time you feel the baby move, you'll click it, though other fetal monitors may work differently. The test lasts 20 to 40 minutes. What the nonstress test results mean A baby who moves a lot and has a normal heart rate is classified as ""reactive"" i.e. healthy and not under any stress. A ""nonreactive"" baby is one who does not make a minimum number of movements during the 40-minute period or whose heart doesn't accelerate as much as expected when he does move. A nonreactive result does not necessarily mean your baby is in danger. However it could mean your baby isn't getting enough oxygen. Technicians will make a noise over your belly or offer you a sugary drink to encourage your baby to move, or the test may be done for another 40 minutes. If your practitioner determines that your baby could be under stress, she'll order further testing (like a  biophysical profile ) to determine if  labor induction  and early delivery are necessary.

Are E-Cigarettes & Vaping Safe for Pregnant Women?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/e-cigarettes-vaping-during-pregnancy/,"As a mom-to-be, youll do anything to protect your little one. That means if you smoked before you conceived, you might have switched from conventional  cigarettes  to e-cigarettes because you heard they were harmless. Or, if youre a non-smoker, you might have wondered whether secondhand vapor from electronic cigarettes affects your baby. While theres still questions that need to be answered about vaping and pregnancy, heres what expectant moms need to know. What are e-cigarettes? E-cigarettes come in many shapes in sizes: regular cigarettes, cigars, pipes, pens, pocket flashlights, small screwdrivers or USB memory sticks. And the terminology is just as varied  you may hear them called e-cigs, cigalikes, vape pens, personalized vaporizers or mechanical mods. Whatever the shape or name, all of these are devices that deliver nicotine in a vapor (aerosol) instead of the tobacco smoke of a traditional cigarette. With most e-cigarettes, puffing on the cartridge heats up water, which releases vapor (hence why its known as vaping instead of smoking). The water, known as e-liquid, can be flavored or unflavored, and it can also come in varying levels of nicotine  which is why some people claim it allows smokers to graduate down to a lower level and eventually give up nicotine completely. Are e-cigs safer than regular cigarettes? Experts dont know yet, since the product is relatively new and difficult to study: No researcher would willingly put an expecting mom potentially in harms way in the name of research. Whats more, there are hundreds of e-cigarette brands and thousands of e-liquid flavors, and they just recently began to be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That means that up until the summer of 2016, it was impossible know what ingredients each maker was putting into its e-cigarettes. And vaping products are relatively new in the U.S., so there isnt enough research to determine what health issues they might cause in the short- or long-term. Heres what is known: Tobacco smoke from conventional cigarettes contains a mix of more than 7,000 chemicals, of which many are toxic or cancer-causing. E-cigarettes, on the other hand, emit fewer toxins and chemicals. A February 2017 study published in the  Annals of Internal Medicine  found that e-cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes because of the significant reduction in cancer-causing chemicals ingested by e-cigarette users compared to regular smokers. The reduction in risk was only found in those who stopped smoking cigarettes entirely, however. But e-cigarette vapor definitely isnt harmless water vapor. The liquids used in e-cigarettes are typically made up of propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine and flavoring chemicals. And some research has shown that when this liquid is heated at a high voltage (some vaping products allow the user to determine how low or high the voltage to produce more or less vapor), other chemicals are formed, and some of them, like formaldehyde, cause cancer. RELATED: The Danger of Using E-Cigarettes Around Kids A recent review published by the FDA also reported  that the level of nicotine listed on the labels of e-cigarette cartridges and refill solutions is often significantly different from whats actually in the product. And potentially harmful chemicals (besides nicotine) were found in the cartridges, refill solutions and aerosols of e-cigarettes. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which represents the nations pediatricians, warns that any exposure to e-cigarettes, including secondhand exposure, may be dangerous for children. Thats why the group as well as the American Medical Association (AMA)  recommended the FDA regulate e-cigarettes  the same as other tobacco products  meaning taxing e-cigarettes; increasing the nationwide age to purchase tobacco products (including e-cigarettes) to 21; and implementing bans on public smoking, advertising to children and teens, online sales of e-cigarettes, and all flavors of e-liquid. And because ingesting e-liquid can be deadly, the AAP is also recommending child-resistant packaging for e-cigarettes and liquids. The danger of using cigarettes or e-cigarettes when youre pregnant Smoking during pregnancy can be harmful to your baby both before and after birth  which is why many groups, including the AMA, AAP and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which represents American OB-GYNs, urge moms to avoid lighting up at all during pregnancy. That goes for conventional cigarettes as well as e-cigarettes, since e-cigarettes still expose your baby to nicotine and other potentially harmful substances. Note that while the following links have been made specifically to tobacco cigarettes, because e-cigarettes do contain nicotine, experts are concerned that they could also increase the risk for: Ectopic pregnancy Miscarriage Problems with the placenta (such as  placental abruption ) Preterm delivery Stillbirth Low birth weight, which may require  hospitilization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Higher risk of birth defects (including orofacial clefts and decreased lung and brain development) After birth, children of mothers who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy are at higher risk of: Asthma Colic Development of mental health problems like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Exposure to secondhand e-cigarette smoke during pregnancy Even if you arent using e-cigarettes, they could still affect you and your unborn child. A study in the journal  Nicotine & Tobacco Research  found that  e-cigarettes emit significant amounts of nicotine . That means if youre nearby when someone is vaping an e-cigarette, you could be exposed to secondhand nicotine. In addition, since the aerosol can contain other potentially harmful chemicals, youd be exposed to those too. For now, the effects of secondhand e-cigarette vapor aren't fully known. However, its clear that secondhand exposure to tobacco cigarettes is definitely associated with some serious health issues, including heart disease, lung cancer and stroke. Secondhand tobacco smoke also increases the risk of SIDS and can cause health problems in children, such as more frequent illnesses, asthma and other breathing problems, and ear infections, as well as greater risk of being addicted to nicotine later in life themselves. Occasional exposure when youre out and about is unavoidable and not something you should fret over  it's repeated, frequent exposure that concerns experts. So to limit secondhand exposure to e-cigarette vapors, the AAP also recommended the government implement regulations to restrict smoking and tobacco products in all workplaces, including bars, restaurants and health care facilities,"" as well as bans ""in places where children live, learn and play, including sidewalks, recreational and sports facilities, entertainment venues, parks, schools and dormitories and multi-unit housing. For now, though, no such nationwide regulations exist, and very few states have laws about when and where e-cigarettes can be used. Doctor recommendations for pregnancy Experts recommend limiting your exposure to cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor as much as possible during pregnancy. Heres how: Avoid all nicotine products, including cigarettes, e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products like chewing tobacco Make your home and car smoke-free If you'renot ready to quit smoking, smoke outside of the home with a separate layer of clothes and take them off before coming inside, since smoke products can linger on clothes Ask people not to smoke around you Make sure the places you visit (for instance, restaurants) are smoke-free If youre visiting the home of someone you know smokes inside, try to socialize outside whenever possible Safer ways to quit smoking Although there are some claims that e-cigarettes can help people to stop smoking, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says theres no evidence to prove this; e-cigarettes are not approved as a smoking cessation device. In fact, some  studies have even shown that e-cigarettes make you significantly less likely to kick the habit . The following safer alternatives are recommended for pregnant women: Quit on your own.  Giving up smoking on your own can be a tough process  but the good news is many people do it successfully. To increase the likelihood that youll be a former smoker: Create a quit plan (check out NCIs  Smokefree.gov  for a personalized plan) that features your reasons for quitting (including the little darling growing inside of you), smoking triggers (so that you can avoid them) and strategies to help you deal with cravings.  Practice healthy habits: Keep busy, eat well and get enough sleep. Find alternative ways to relieve stress  like exercise or deep breathing and meditation. Miss the feeling of having something in your mouth? The American Cancer Society recommends keeping substitutes around that you can suck or chew on, like carrots, apples, raisins, hard candy or gum. Get backup from other resources.  You dont have to go through the struggle of quitting alone. In addition to help from family and friends, other support resources are available: 1-800-QUIT-NOW hotline provides free one-one-one advice, help creating a quit plan, educational materials, information on FDA-approved cessation methods and referrals to local resources. The NCIs  Smokefree Women  website provides information and nonjudgmental support to pregnant women and mothers who are seeking information, advice or assistance in quitting any nicotine product, including e-cigarettes. The NCIs text messaging service,  SmokefreeMOM , provides support, information and tips to pregnant moms. The messages a mom-to-be receives depend on her due date and whether shes indicated shes not yet ready to stop or she wants to reduce or quit entirely. Nicotine Anonymous , online support groups and local smoking cessation programs can be helpful. Seek counseling.  In addition to support lines and groups, many people find counseling from a doctor or other smoking cessation professional to be helpful  in fact,  some research has found that moms who get counseling  are 80 percent more likely to quit as well as less likely to pick up smoking again later. Ask your doctor about counseling, or check with local clinics or hospitals to see if they have counselors you can meet face-to-face. Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement therapy.  If you have difficulty quitting on your own or with the help of counseling, your doctor may be able to help you quit by using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). NRT products include over-the-counter gums, patches and lozenges, as well as prescription nasal sprays and inhalers. These products should be used only under your doctors care since they contain nicotine, which is best avoided during pregnancy. The nicotine-free medications Zyban and Chantix generally arent recommended during pregnancy. Experts strongly warn against using e-cigarettes when you're expecting. So although quitting may feel impossibly hard at times, kicking the nicotine habit during pregnancy is your safest bet for you and your baby, andthere is support to help you make it happen. Remind yourself, especially when the going gets tough: You'll save lots of money, too  and what a reward it will be to put your hard-earned dollars toward a new stroller or your child's college fund.

Fetal Sense of Smell: What Baby Can Sniff in Utero,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-smell/,"Heres a wild fact: Your days-old newborn baby will be able to recognize you, Mom, simply by the smell of your skin. Whats more, the foods you eat while youre expecting not only affect  your developing babys sense of taste , they impact her sense of smell, too. Heres what you need to know about fetal sense of smell -- including when and how it develops as well as how what you eat may impact your little one for years to come. The Development of Fetal Sense of Smell Your babys sense of smell starts developing at a relatively early age. Between  6 weeks  and 7 weeks of pregnancy, olfactory neurons, which help your babys brain to process odors, develop. By 7 to  8 weeks , the two symmetrical nasal cavities that are the foundation of your babys nose have formed. Soon after, the nasal passages open, connecting what your baby inhales through her nostrils to what she tastes in her mouth. Although it was once thought that plugs blocked these passages until mid-pregnancy, researchers now say they remain open throughout. Around  weeks 7  to 10, your babys trigeminal system develops -- which allows her nose to react to touch and warmth as well as chemical stimuli in what she smells, like the freshness of mint or the spiciness of peppers. By  weeks 10  to 12, olfactory smell receptors form. Between  weeks 11  to 19, those receptors' neurons in your babys nose connect with the olfactory bulb in the brain. Together, these structures enable the scents the fetus inhales to communicate with her brain. And by late in the second trimester, your babys little nose is ready to detect odors. Can Your Baby Smell in the Womb? Most of the research on the early development of fetal smell has been done on animals, since its challenging to safely study human babies in the womb. But research on preterm infants has shown that babies are indeed capable of smelling throughout the third trimester and possibly even earlier. Experts believe fetuses may be able to start smelling -- i.e. reacting to the chemicals they breathe in through their noses -- in the womb as early as month 6, though the sense really ramps up during months 8 and 9 of pregnancy. What You Eat, Your Baby Smells Your baby starts swallowing amniotic fluid  around week 17 of pregnancy  and  breathing it in around week 25 . While she gets the oxygen and all the nutrients she needs from you  through the umbilical cord and placenta , shes already practicing these very important movements to prepare for life outside the womb. And since what you eat gets passed on to your amniotic fluid, your baby not only tastes but smells the foods you swallow. A number of studies  have shown  that when pregnant women eat certain strongly-flavored foods throughout the last months of pregnancy, newborn babies recognize the odors immediately after birth -- showing that your baby detects and memorizes these scents in the womb. Those memories may last for years: One study  found that moms who ate super-garlicky meals during the last 5 weeks of pregnancy gave birth to kids who were more likely to enjoy garlic at least until the age of 8 or 9 years old. Some evidence even suggests that your baby may be able to smell the scented beauty products you put on your skin and the perfumes you breathe in through your nose, since their chemicals enter your bloodstream and then your amniotic fluid. Research has shown that when an odor is inhaled, the chemicals that make up that smell can be detected in amniotic fluid within a matter of seconds. Your Newborn Recognizes You By Smell A number of studies also show that the tiniest  newborn babies recognize their mothers simply by smell.  Infants noses  can also sniff out breast milk  and even lactating women -- in both cases because breast milk has very specific substances that are extremely attractive to babies. How is this possible? Some of the same chemicals, including a few coming from the foods you eat, are found  in your amniotic fluid  as well as your in skin and breast milk. And it makes sense that infants would be especially attuned to your very specific smell: Your baby needs to be able to recognize and rely on you for meals, comfort and love from day one! How to Encourage Your Babys Sense of Smell All of this means that the foods you eat during pregnancy may influence what your baby likes not only now but for years to come. So focus on snacking on an array of treats and dishes, eating a  balanced and varied diet  featuring plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. And feel free to try any of the stronger-flavored foods -- like garlic or curry -- that youll want to share with your little one later on, since your baby is most likely to experience and develop a preference for those scents and flavors in utero. That said, dont fret that your baby will be addicted for life if you have a weakness for, say, cheese fries. Researchers say that when different moms eat the same foods, the chemical compounds that appear in their amniotic fluid actually end up being very different -- so their babies arent actually exposed to the same scent and flavors. Keep in mind that there are lot of special factors at play, both in and out of your control, that affect every aspect of how your baby develops. The most important thing to remember and look forward to is that when that beautiful baby of yours is born, he or she will recognize you just by the way you smell after all the fine-tuning of that cute little nose that happened in utero.

The Simple Way You Might Be Able to Lower Your Chance of a C-Section,http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/more-iv-fluids-during-labor-reduces-c-section-risk/,"If you have your heart set on a  vaginal birth , chances are good you'll get your wish 2 in 3 moms have their babies that way. But a new study has found that getting more IV fluids during labor and delivery may be a relatively simple way to tilt the odds even more in your favor and lower your chances of having a  C-section . What the research looked at Experts already know that staying hydrated is super important throughout your pregnancy and especially as your birth nears indeed, being dehydrated can lead to preterm contractions late in pregnancy.  Other research  has found that staying hydrated during birth may help speed labor along by reducing the periods of contraction and relaxation of the uterus. During labor, you can stay hydrated in two ways: by drinking lots of water (or eating ice chips) and/or  by receiving IV fluids . In the U.S., most women receive 125 mL of IV fluids per hour theyre in labor. Researchers at Thomas Jefferson University compiled the data of seven small studies that included a total of 1,215 women. About half (622 women) received 125 mL of IV fluids an hour, while the other half (593 women) received twice as much 250 mL of IV fluids per hour. The  results were published online  in  Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.     Melanoma Therapy   A Treatment for   Metastatic Melanoma.   melanomatreatmentpossibility.com       What the study found The study authors found that women who received the higher dose of IV fluids (250 mL per hour) had lower rates of C-section (12.5 percent vs. 18.1 percent in women who received 125 mL) as well as shorter labors, by 64 minutes on average, with nearly 3 minutes less of pushing. What you need to know In the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  latest committee opinion , which seeks to reduce the number of unnecessary labor and delivery interventions, the group no longer recommends routine IV fluids for low-risk women in labor. Thats because the tubes can get in the way if youre moving around to try various labor positions and the proven benefits of IV during labor dont warrant its routine use. That said, not all women are in that low-risk group, so your practitioner may decide that IV fluids are best for you and your baby. Bottom line: If youre concerned about having a C-section and staying well-hydrated during labor, talk to your practitioner about what he or she thinks is best for your baby and if that involves IV fluids, whether you should be getting a heftier dose. Together you can come up with a plan that youre comfortable with and thats safe for you and your baby. RELATED STORIES AHH, THE BENEFITS OF WATER ... Are You Drinking Enough Water During Pregnancy?

Kate Middleton Gets Real About “Overwhelming Experience” of Becoming a Mom,http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/family/kate-middleton-gets-real-overwhelming-experience-becoming-mom/,"The Duchess of Cambridge undoubtedly makes motherhood look easy, as she flashes her near-perfect smile in her hand-selected designer clothes and sky-high stilettos, all while doting on her well-dressed  not to mention well-behaved  toddlers. But Kate Middleton, mom to 3-year-old Prince George and 22-month-old Princess Charlotte, recently opened up about how shes a lot more like us than we ever imagined. Sure, she has way more help when it comes to raising and caring for her little ones than 99 percent of the rest of us (which she totally admits to), but while speaking at the  Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  in London on Thursday she nodded to the very real and very sensitive side of motherhood: mental health. ""Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience. However, at times it has also been a huge challenge  even for me who has support at home that most mothers do not, the Duchess said while introducing the  Out of the Blue  documentary film series, which provides awareness for  mental health during the early years of parenthood . ""Nothing can really prepare you for the sheer overwhelming experience of what it means to become a mother. It is full of complex emotions of joy, exhaustion, love and worry, all mixed together. Your fundamental identity changes overnight. You go from thinking of yourself as primarily an individual to suddenly being a mother, first and foremost."" She continued to talk about how theres no rulebook or right or wrong when it comes to motherhood. You just have to make it up and do the very best you can to care for your family. This definitely speaks to the plight most parents face, when they might not be able to afford the best child care facility, or even child care at all, let alone have enough financial support to provide themselves with adequate care and stability. In a nutshell: Kate  gets  us. Yes, motherhood is incredibly rewarding and life changing in every way, but its certainly no walk in the park even for privileged (or royal!) parents. But Kate didnt only address mental health awareness in mothers with children  she also drew attention to the importance of  mental health awareness for expecting mothers . ""Many of these women also suffer in silence, overwhelmed by negative feelings, but also afraid to admit to the struggles they are facing due to the fear or shame of what others might think if they 'arent coping.'"" This speech came just one month after the Duchess made another unusual move for a member of the royal family: serving as guest editor for the Huffington Post on February 17 to announce the launch of Young Minds Matter, a new series that focuses on the mental health of young children specifically. Considering the fact that approximately one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, according to the  World Health Organization , this spotlight is long overdue.

Tips on Writing a Birth Plan,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/labor-and-delivery/birth-plan/,"By this point in your  pregnancy  you've spent a lot of time thinking about baby names, which brand of car seat to buy and whether you're going to stay home or go back to work after your sweet baby arrives. But have you given any thought to how you want your  labor and delivery  experience to go? This is the perfect time to create a birth plan. The big day will be here before you know it! What is a birth plan and what should it include? A birth plan is just that  a plan that communicates your wishes and goals for before, during, and after labor and delivery. In it, parents-to-be can offer up their best-case birthing scenario: how they'd ideally like labor and delivery to play out if all goes to ""plan."" Besides listing those preferences, the typical birth plan factors in what's practical, what's feasible, and what the practitioner and hospital or birthing center will accommodate (not everything on a birth plan may fly with them) or have available. Some practitioners routinely ask an expectant couple to fill out a birth plan, while others are happy to oblige if one is requested. Why create a birth plan? Not only can a good birth plan deliver a better birth experience, but it can also head off unrealistic expectations, minimize disappointment, and eliminate major conflict and miscommunication between a birth mom and her birth attendants. It's also a springboard for dialog between patient and practitioner. Not sure how yourpractitioner feels about some of your birth preferences? Now, well before labor starts, is the time to find out. What to keep in mind about birth plans A birth plan is a written understanding  not a binding contract  between you and your practitioner, and though chances are very good that your plan can be carried out just they way you drew it up, there's always the chance that it won't. For example, a birth plan you design ahead of time may not end up being medically advisable  or what works for you in the moment  and may have to be adjusted at the last minute for your baby'swell being and yours. Or, a change of mind (yours) can also prompt a change of plan (you were dead set against having an epidural, but somewhere around 5 cm, you become dead set on having one). That's why the most important part of a good birth plan is flexibility. Childbirth is unpredictable: The best-laid plans don't always go, well, according to plan. Your birth plan checklist There's no right or wrong way to write a birth plan. Some birth plans cover just the basics, while others are extremely detailed. And because every expectant woman is different  not only in what she'd like out of the birth experience but what she can likely expect given her particular pregnancy profile and history  a birth plan should be individualized. If you're wondering what you should include in your personalized plan, use the following four areas as a guide: Requests before birth Requests during labor and delivery Vaginal vs. C-section birth preferences Requests for newborn care Requests before birth What do you want the atmosphere where you give birth to be like? List your desires, remembering that not all choices may be permitted. Some issues or scenarios you may want to tackle include: Who you'd like to have with you (besides your partner) during labor and/or at delivery  including a  doula , your other children, friends, family Eating or drinking during active labor Being out of bed (walking around or sitting up) during labor Being in a tub for labor and/or birth Personalizing the atmosphere with music, lighting, items from home Taking photos or videos What equipment  exercise ball, in-room shower, birthing tub  you may want available to you (permitting your chosen facility can accommodate your request) for use in active labor Specific  birthing positions  you'd like your practitioner to support you in Requests during labor and delivery This is where you can be clear about how you want to labor, the manner in which you will manage labor pain, and what labor procedures you are comfortable with. Issues or scenarios you may want to address are: The type of birth you're planning The use of an  epidural  or  other pain medication   or wishes about  alternatives to pain meds Artificial rupture of the membranes and/or leaving membranes intact External and internal fetal monitoring The use of an IV or catheter The use of oxytocin to induce or augment contractions Your practitioner's position on episiotomies vs. natural tearing The use of interventions like forceps or vacuum extraction to assist in the birth of your child Vaginal delivery vs. C-section preferences Even if you know you don't want a  medical induction  or  C-section , it's important to prepare for unexpected events by listing your preferences regarding those processes. However, know that your health care provider may advise against some of your preferences, especially if you are high risk or experience a medical emergency during labor and delivery.   Requests for newborn care How do you want the moments after your baby's birth to unfold? Use this part of your birth plan to share your expectations of care for both you and your baby during recovery. Here are some issues and scenarios to consider: Special requests around suctioning baby, such as suctioning by the father Holding the baby immediately after birth, allowing baby time to creep from belly to breast Plans for  breastfeeding  immediately, having a lactation consultant there to help When to cut the cord, and  cord blood banking Having your partner catch the baby and/or cut the cord Postponing weighing the baby and/or administering eye drops until after you and your baby greet each other Special requests around the  placenta Example birth plan templates If you're still unsure about what should go in your birth plan or feeling overwhelmed by all the decisions surrounding your baby's birth, don't worry: There's plenty of online resources to help. You can download a customizable, extensive birth plan template to print out and fill in based on your responses to the options listed above (and perhaps those not addressed).  My Birth Plan  and  Earth Mama  are good places to start. Once you've finished, print out that first version of your birth plan and take it to your next practitioner visit as a means for opening up discussion. After you talk about your preferences for your childbirth experience with your practitioner, listen to what he or she has to say about your labor options. If there are any changes you need to make, update your birth plan. Make several copies of your health care provider-approved birth plan and have them available for the labor and delivery nursing team, as well as the post-birth nursing team. Bottom line: Birth plans, though by no means necessary, are a great option, one that more and more expectant parents are taking advantage of. To figure out whether a birth plan is right for you and what should be in it, talk it over with your practitioner at your next visit. 3 Things to Read Next: What Really Happens During Labor Natural Ways to Induce Labor Video: Packing Your Hospital Bag"
