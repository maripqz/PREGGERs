Is Homemade Baby Food Really Healthier for Infants?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/homemade-baby-food-healthier-infants/,"Between the planning, meal prep, work it requires to cook it to babys liking, babys picky appetite and babys tendency to put much of their food anywhere except in their mouths, its not surprising many parents dont crank out babys meals in-house themselves. But a new study published in the International Journal of Obesity is saying homemade baby food is the way to go. In fact, it may even produce leaner babies with more diverse diets than store-bought baby food.What the study looked atResearchers examined the diets of 65 infants. They assessed their body fat percentage from exams taken when they were 6, 9, 12 and 36 months old to determine whether the source of the baby food  homemade or commercially produced  influenced, in any way, their growth and weight.They found that by 9 months old, 22 percent of the infants had exclusively received homemade food and approximately the same percentage had received exclusively store-bought food. The majority of babies had received a combination of both homemade and store-bought. While there werent major differences in the infants lengths or weight at this age, researchers did find that the infants getting only homemade food were covering more of the seven different food groups than the babies only eating store-bought foods.At 12 months old, however, researchers began to see significant differences in the percentage of body fat in the infants; the percentage was higher in those consuming only store-bought foods.What the research foundWhile the study was relatively small and involved limitations, including relying on parents to accurately recall and report how the babies were fed, the study did find that babies who ate a diet of only homemade foods were exposed to more diverse foods earlier in life and had lower body fat mass by the time they were 1 to 3 years old.What this means for parentsTheres no way around it  making homemade baby food is certainly more time-consuming and involves more planning than purchasing brand varieties at your local grocery store. But there are some benefits in addition to the potential health perks it provides to your child.You know exactly what youre feeding your baby. There will be no need to put on your reading glasses to check the ingredients on the tiny labels. When youre the chef, you know what youre putting into your babys food.There are so many tools available to simplify the process. From blenders to freezer trays and small glass containers, there are so many products on the market that help ease the cooking, planning and prepping process for parents.You might even save money. Store-bought baby food can be pricey  especially when youre going the all-organic and all-natural route. Plus, when you cut out the container cost and prices involved in keeping it on store shelves, you might even save money by cooking it at home and reusing your own containers.Making your own baby foodIdeally, you want to stock up on loads of fresh fruits and veggies  frozen is fine as long as you read the ingredients closely to avoid brands with added sugar or salt. If you have a blender, its easy to toss in flavors your babys used to  for example, carrots or sweet potatoes (also naturally sweet so picky eaters are more likely to munch on them). But the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends holding off on gas-causing cruciferous veggies like broccoli and cauliflower until your little one is 10 to 12 months old.RELATED STORIESMORE BABY-FEEDING TIPSStarting SolidsMORE ON BABY NUTRITION Nutritional Needs of BabiesMORE ON MAKING FEEDING TIME A SUCCESSBaby Feeding Problems  and How to Fix Them"

Introducing Solid Foods to Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/introducing-solid-foods/,"Introducing solid foods is one of the most exciting (if messy) milestones of your baby's first year. Think of all the tastes and textures that await your little one  from savory cheese to juicy mango to creamy avocado. There's a whole world of flavors to discover and explore, and starting solids is the first step. Encourage your baby to enjoy herself while trying new foods, even if a good portion of them ends up on her bib, the tray or the floor. It's all part of the great experiment of taking those taste buds to the next level.WHEN CAN MY BABY START SOLIDS?Most babies are ready to start solids between 4 and 6 months, but your little one's individual development definitely tops the list when deciding whether or not it's time to graduate to a more varied diet. Though you might be eager to hop on the feeding bandwagon sooner rather than later, there are plenty of reasons why starting a baby on solids too soon isn't smart.First, a very early introduction to solids can occasionally trigger allergies. And a young baby's digestive system  from a tongue that pushes out any foreign substance placed on it, to intestines still lacking many digestive enzymes  is unready developmentally for solids. Plus, solids aren't necessary early on  babies can fill all their nutritional needs for the first 6 months of life from breast milk or formula alone.Bringing on the solids too soon can also undermine future eating habits (baby may reject those spoonfuls initially simply because she isn't ready, then may reject them later because of previous parental pushing). And especially in formula-fed babies, early introduction of solids can lead to obesity later on in childhood and beyond.On the other hand, waiting too long  say, until 8 or 9 months  can also lead to potential pitfalls. An older baby may resist being taught the new (and challenging) tricks of chewing and swallowing solids, preferring to cling to the tried-and-true (and easy) methods of breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. And, like habits, tastes can be harder to change at this point. Unlike the more pliable younger baby, an older baby may not be as open to solids when milky liquids have long monopolized the menu.SIGNS MY BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDSTo decide if your baby is ready for the big step into the world of solid foods at 4 months, not till 6 months, or somewhere in between, look for the following clues  and then consult your doctor:Your baby can hold her head up well when propped to sit. Even strained baby foods should not be offered until then. Chunkier foods should wait until a baby can sit well alone, usually not until 7 months.The tongue thrust reflex has disappeared. Try this test: Place a tiny bit of baby-appropriate food thinned with breast milk or formula in your baby's mouth from the tip of a baby spoon or your finger. If the food comes right back out again with that tiny tongue, and continues to after several tries, the thrust is still present and baby isn't ready for spoon-feeding.Your baby reaches for and otherwise shows an interest in table foods. If she's grabbing the fork out of your hand or watching intently and excitedly with every bite you take, that may be a sign that she's hungry for more grown-up fare.Your baby is able to make back-and-forth and up-and-down movements with the tongue. How can you tell? Just watch carefully.Your little one is able to open wide, so that food can be taken from a spoon.WHAT ARE THE BEST FIRST FOODS TO FEED BABY?No matter what's on the menu, the texture of yourbaby's first foodsshould be super smooth and practically dripping off the spoon. If you prepare your own food, you should strain, puree or finely mash it, and then thin it with liquid if necessary. As your baby becomes a more experienced eater (usually around 7 months or older), gradually reduce the liquid you add and thicken the texture. Here are three foods to start with:Cereal. If you start with baby cereal, pick a single-grain, iron-enriched, whole-grain variety, like brown rice, whole-grain oat or whole-grain barley. To prepare, mix a small amount of baby cereal with formula, breast milk or even water to create a creamy ""soup."" Don't sweeten the taste by adding things like mashed bananas, applesauce or juice  first, because it's best to introduce only one food at a time, and second, because it's better for baby to acquire a taste for plain before you sweeten the cereal pot.Vegetables. Start with milder yellow or orange options such as sweet potatoes and carrots before moving on to the green team, like peas and string beans, which have slightly stronger flavors. If your baby rejects what you give her, try again tomorrow and the next day and the next. Some babies need to be introduced to a new food four or five (or more!) times before they'll accept it, so perseverance is key.Fruit.Delicious, digestible first fruits include finely mashed bananas, baby applesauce, peaches and pears. For something completely different, and completely baby-friendly, start with smoothed-down mashed or pureed ripe avocado  it's creamy, yummy and loaded with healthy fats.Otherwise, you might want to adopt an approach that's often called ""baby-led weaning,"" which bypasses pureed solids in favor of gummable solid foods presented in thick, long pieces, which younger babies can hold in their fists. (However, the pincer grasp, which enables babies to make the leap to finger foods, doesn't usually develop until around month 8.)HOW CAN I HELP INTRODUCE SOLID FOODS TO MY BABY?One of the first and best steps in raising a good eater is to model healthy enjoyment of food yourself. Babies who see adults eating good food and enjoying it are more likely to be interested in following their example. A few more tips to help your baby discover solids:Time it right. The ""perfect"" time of day to feed your baby is whatever time works for both of you. If you're breastfeeding, you might try solids when your milk supply is at its lowest (probably late afternoon or early evening). Experiment: Offer a first course of formula or breast milk to whet that appetite, then bring on the solids. Start with one meal per day, then move up to two (probably a morning and evening meal) for the next month or so.Monitor baby's mood. As trying as those first feedings may be for you, they're even more of a challenge for your little one. So keep in mind that a baby who's cheerful and alert is more likely to open wide for an incoming spoon, and one who's cranky or getting sleepy may want only breast (or bottle). If your baby is fussy, be flexible  you might want to skip solids at that meal and try them next time.Don't rush. Food is never fast when it comes to babies  you'll be surprised at how long it takes to get one little spoonful into that little mouth (and ultimately down the hatch). Give yourself and your baby plenty of time for feedings  and get plenty of practice, too. You'll need it.Sit pretty. Holding a squirming baby on your lap while trying to deposit an unfamiliar substance into an unreceptive mouth is a perfect recipe for disaster. Before your baby actually takes bite one, let her practice sitting in the high chair or feeding seat for a couple of days, adjusting the height of the tray or seat so it fits just right. And dont forget how wiggly your little worm can be  always fasten the safety straps, including the one around the crotch. If baby cant sit up at all in such a chair or seat, it's probably a good idea to postpone solids a little longer.Gear up. Skip the silver spoon  a silicone, plastic or corn-based model with a small, soft bowl is much easier on tender gums. Count on having several on hand during feedings (one for you, one for baby and a spare when one lands on the floor) to foster baby's sense of independence and avoid power struggles (yes, those happen even at this age). And while youre gearing up, a word to the wise: Don't forget to put a bib on baby right from the start or youll face big-time resistance later.Make some introductions. Before even attempting to bring spoon to mouth, put a dab of the food on the table or high chair tray and give baby a chance to examine it, squish it, mash it, rub it and maybe even taste it. That way, when you do approach with the spoon, what youre offering wont be totally unfamiliar.Ease in. For someone whos brand new to the concept of spoon-feeding  and all the new textures that go with it  solids can come as a bit of a shock. So ease in. Start by gently placing about a quarter teaspoon of food on the tip of babys tongue. If thats swallowed, place the next quarter teaspoon a little farther back. At first, expect almost as much food to come in as goes out. Eventually your little one will get the hang of spoon-feeding  and respond mouth-open.Count on rejection. Even bland tastes can be acquired tastes for a brand new solids eater. Babies may reject a new food several times or more before they decide to like it. So dont push when baby snubs what the spoon is delivering. But do try again another day.Invite imitation. What your baby monkey sees, she may be more likely to do. It's an old parent trick but a goodie: Open up wide and take a pretend taste from the spoon  and don't forget to smack your lips and relish your make-believe bite enthusiastically.Know when enough is enough. Knowing when it's time to stop feeding is as important as knowing when to start. A turned head or a clenched mouth are sure signs that baby is finished with this meal. Forcing a baby to eat is always a lost cause  and can actually set up future food fights.Need more help? These extra tips introducing solid foods to your baby should do the trick.WATCH FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONSWhilefood allergiesare pretty common in babies, kids usually outgrow them  though you do need to take them seriously. Babies' reactions to food can range from gassiness, diarrhea or mucus in the stool to vomiting and rashes  especially around the mouth or bottom. Other symptoms include a runny nose, watery eyes, wheezing that doesn't seem to be due to a cold and unusual wakefulness or crankiness, day or night.If you think your baby may be allergic to something you've fed her, wait about a week before trying the food again. If you get a similar reaction two or three times in a row, you can probably assume she's sensitive to it. Eliminate that food from her diet for several months, then try it again if your pediatrician gives the green light. If your baby seems to react to almost every new food you offer, or there's a history of allergies in your family, wait a full week between trying any new item, and do check in with your doctor.HOW DO I PREVENT CHOKING?Here's what to do to prevent choking when solid food is on the menu:Stay close.At this point, eating should be a spectator sport, with you closely watching every bite your baby takes.Start small. Cut food into pieces tiny enough that your baby can swallow them whole if she doesn't spend any time gumming them (enthusiastic eaters often gulp them down).Get bigger slowly. As your baby gets used to eating pieces of soft, solid food (and as you get more comfortable watching her eat them successfully), gradually move upfrom minced to chopped to small cubes.Keep the portions baby-sized. Place only one or two chunks at a time on the plate or tray so she doesn't stuff in more than she can handle.Stay seated. Not you, but baby. Offer finger foods to your baby only when she's sitting down  not crawling, cruising or toddling around. Eating on the run isn't just bad manners; it's unsafe for the inexperienced eater.Stay safe. Don't give your baby foods that won't dissolve in the mouth, can't be mashed with the gums or can be easily sucked into the windpipe. Avoid uncooked raisins, whole peas (unless they are smashed), raw, firm-fleshed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) or fruit (apples, unripe pears, grapes), large chunks of meat or poultry, and common choking hazards including popcorn, nuts, chunky nut butters and hot dogs.WHAT NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN INTRODUCING SOLIDSAlarming as it might seem, if your baby gags during her first encounter with any kind of food, her reaction is normal. When a baby gags, its a sign that she has either taken in too much food or pushed it too far back in her mouth. In either case, the gag reflex is what helps her get that food all the way out of harm's way (and, usually, all the way back out onto the bib or tray in the process).Make sure your baby is sitting upright in her chair, offer manageable servings and be sure to learn the difference between gagging and choking. A child who is choking will look terrified, will not be making any sounds and will be unable to breathe; a baby who is experiencing a gag reflex will be coughing and making sounds.Also, if most of what you serve your baby ends up on the floor or otherwise uneaten, it's not a cause for concern, aside from any completely legit worries you might have about wasting food (and you can help conserve food and prevent waste by keeping serving sizes small). Your baby's first experiments with food are more about the ""experiment"" and less about the food  more about gaining experience than gaining sustenance, in other words. The bulk of your child's nutritional needs for the first year are still going to be met by breast milk or formula.Also, although it was once common to delay giving a baby certain foods like dairy, eggs, seafood and nuts in the hopes of staving off allergies,the AAP no longer recommends doing sosince the data shows that holding off on certain foods does not prevent food allergies. In fact, in 2015,the AAP said that introducing allergenic foodslike peanut butter earlier in a child's lifein the4- to 11-month rangeactuallyreducesher chances of developing a food allergy.Just be sure you've successfully introduced a couple of other solids (cereals, fruits or vegetables) first, and be sure to introduce the foods one at a time at home (not, say, at baby's day care center).Not so sure what's best for your baby? Check with her pediatrician.WHAT WILL MY BABY BE READY FOR NEXT?Those early-bird specials (rice cereal, applesauce, bananas, yellow veggies) get pretty old after a few dozen meals. Spice things up (at around 7 or 8 months) by adding minced meat (chicken, lamb, turkey or beef), mashed eggs and avocado to her repertoire. By 8 months (and possibly even sooner), whole-milk yogurt, cheese, pasta, beans and tofu can make their debuts, and thenfinger foodsadd a whole other dimension to eating.Ready to serve up a combo platter? That's fine, as long as you keep the foods separate for a while. Your goal is to get your baby acquainted (and happy) with the taste of particular foods, so if you mush the meats and veggies together, she may never know the joy of just plain peas. Once she likes the taste of a variety of different flavors, feel free to mix things up.Always hold off on honey (which can contain spores ofClostridium botulinum,a bacteria that is harmless to adults but can cause botulism, a serious illness, in babies) and cow's milk until your baby is at least 1 year old. Most doctors will, however, green-light whole-milk yogurt, cottage cheese and hard cheese by 8 months or so, or even sooner.If all this sounds complicated, take heart: In some ways, feeding a baby is easier than satisfying sophisticated older palates. Baby's first solid foods can be served cold, slightly warmed or at room temperature. And don't worry about adding salt, sugar or other spices  even the mildest pureed squash is an adventurous new taste and sensation for a little one just starting out."
Food Messiness,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/behavior/food-messiness.aspx,"What it isOops, time for another load of laundry! Just as much food ends up on your toddler's face, hands, clothes, high chair, and floor as it does in his mouth. Some tuneful tots also get into the habit of making razzing sounds while blowing out food from their mouths  creating a mess in the process.Why it happensChildren who are learning how to feed themselves brandish their spoon with delight (""There goes another pea!""). But that doesn't mean they're intentionally setting out to create a mess. Eating is a learning experience (""What will happen if I squish this with my fingers?"") and a time to fine-tune those fine-motor self-feeding skills.What you need to knowHave patience. Let him practice the art of self-feeding (messes included) and your toddler will gradually become more skilled at feeding himself. In fact, most children will master this skill by the time they're 20 months old. If yours hasn't yet, bring it up with the pediatrician at your next visit.ADVERTISINGWhat to do about itIn addition to the following tips, check out the strategies for handling Food Throwing.Serve foods that are more likely to stick to the spoon, such as chunky applesauce, mashed potatoes, and oatmeal.If your child is a ""food blower,"" make sure he gets no reaction from you. That means no admonishment or sign of amusement. You might also switch to foods that aren't as suitable for creating sound effects, such as slivers of banana, pieces of cheese, teething biscuits, and soft, whole-grain bread.How to prevent itGive your child plenty of opportunity to play with finger paint, bubbles, sand, play clay, and other interesting material. Providing fun, tactile, nonfood experiences may help reduce your toddler's culinary curiosity at the table."

Toddler Not Eating,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/ask-heidi/toddler-not-eating.aspx,"Toddlers are notoriously picky eaters, and you can look forward to your daughter or son going through all kinds of phases when it comes to food (let's see, there's the ""only beige food"" phase, the ""no foods that touch each other"" phase, the ""one food only"" phase, just to name a few). As for the ""one meal a day"" phase you're experiencing, it's pretty normal and usually nothing to worry about. That's because most parents don't realize how little toddlers actually need to eat (those tiny tummies fill up fast) and also that toddlers actually eat more than their parents think (a handful of Cheerios here and a few cubes of cantaloupe there add up!). The bottom line: If your child is thriving, she's probably getting what she needs.How should you handle your child's food strikes in the meantime? Offer food, but don't push it (parental pushing may lead to future eating problems), and try not to send the signal that her not eating is stressing you out (even if it is!). Make sure you're offering her healthy food choices, so that when she does decide to nibble she's getting the nutrients she needs. Also, be sure there aren't other things sabotaging her appetite. Too many calories from liquids, for example, be it milk or juice, can definitely keep a toddler's tender appetite satisfied, leaving less room for solids. Finally, find out if she's teething: Molars, which usually make a painful entrance between the ages of 13 and 19 months, can also stand in the way of a toddler and her interest in food.Good luck,"

Fish to avoid include seven types of fish that are higher in mercury: tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, marlin and king mackerel.Wondering whether its safe for pregnant women and nursing moms to eat fish caught recreationally? (Spring fishing season is around the corner) The new guidelines suggest erring on the side of caution: Check local state advisories for the waters where the fish was caught; if no information is available, stick to just one serving of these fish per week, with skin and excess fat removed.What expecting women and moms need to knowAn estimated one in two expecting women still eats less than 2 ounces of fish per weekfar less than the current recommendations, which date back to June 2014 when the EPA and FDA released a joint statement encouraging moms to eat more fish.The latest guidelines (which reaffirm previous recommendations) suggest that expecting women eat two to three servings, or 8 to 12 ounces, of lower-mercury fish every week. They also recommend that children 2 years old and up should eat one to two servings of lower-mercury fish every week.Fish are an important source of protein and other nutrients for young children and women who are or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding. This advice clearly shows the great diversity of fish in the U.S. market that they can consume safely, said FDA Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine Stephen Ostroff, M.D., in a statement. This new, clear and concrete advice is an excellent tool for making safe and healthy choices when buying fish.What this means for youFish is an often-overlooked but essential component of any healthy pregnancy diet. So make it a goal to eat two to three 4-oz. servings of good choices low-mercury fish per week. Complement that with plenty of fresh, whole foodsincluding fruits, veggies, lean meats, legumes, dairy and nutsand youll be setting yourself up to make one healthy, well-nourished babyand a healthier mom-to-be, too."
Eating Vegetarian and Vegan During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-vegetarian-vegan-during-pregnancy/,"Got a beef with beef (or chicken, fish, eggs ordairy)? There is no reason to worry. You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet even now that youre expecting. Here is what you should know to make sure you and your baby are still getting everything you need.Can I still follow a vegetarian or vegan diet when I'm pregnant?Don't be surprised if you come across well-meaningnaysayers; there are still so many misconceptions about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy. In truth, vegetarians and vegans have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies. Why is there any concern at all? Some of the most vital baby-boosting nutrients are more easily found in meats and other animal-based products. In good news, it's still a cinch to getthem elsewhere.What nutrients will I need to be extra careful to get when I'm pregnant and vegan or vegetarian?Protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D are all nutrients to be mindful of when you're expecting and adhering to your vegetarian or vegan diet.PROTEINWhy: Expecting women need more protein than ever that's because this essential nutrient helps build cells and make hormones for your growing baby. If youre a dairy- and egg-eating vegetarian, you may already get what you need from potent protein sources (craving moreomelets and Greek yogurt now that you're pregnant?). If you're worried you're not getting enough or are a vegan, there are veggie-based proteins that you can add into your diet. How Much: 75 grams per dayFoods to Eat: Legumes, whole grains, soy and nuts and seedsSplit or green peasChickpeasBlack, navy, kidney or pinto beansQuinoaBulgar, buckwheat and whole wheat couscousOatmealWhole-wheat pastaWhole-grain cereals and breadsNut buttersWalnuts, cashews, pistachios, almonds, Brazil nuts and pine nutsSoy milkTofuMisoCALCIUMWhy:Calcium is keyfor building your babys bones, muscles, heart and nerves, especially during the third trimester. In fact, it's so essential to his development that what he doesn't get from what you eat, he'll take from your bones, potentially putting you at risk of osteoporosis later in life. Luckily, dairy products aren't the onlyoptionsfor getting your daily recommended amounts. Your practitioner may also suggest that you add a calcium supplement for extra insurance.How Much:1,000 mg per dayFoods to Eat:YogurtMilkCheeseGreen leafy vegetablesSoy milkTofuCalcium-fortified orange juiceIRONWhy: Your blood volume increases by nearly 50 percent during pregnancy to support you and your developing baby  and iron is required to produce more red blood cells. Not getting enough? Low iron can result in anemia, which, left untreated, may also lead topreterm labor and low birth weight. Vegetarians and vegans aren't alone in needing to be conscious of iron levels during pregnancy. Even red-meat eaters have a hard time getting enough from their diets while expecting. One simple way to get what you need is to take an iron supplement, which your practitioner may recommend in addition to your prenatal vitamin after week 20 (or earlier, if routine testing shows your iron stores are low). Its a good idea to also chow down on iron-rich foods.How Much: About 27 mgFoods to Eat:BeansEdamameSoy productsOat branBarleyQuinoaBulgurPumpkin seedsDried fruitSpinach, collard greens or kaleSeaweedVITAMIN B12Why: Vitamin B12 partners with folic acid to help with proper fetal brain development; its also important for the formation of red blood cells and for building genetic material. A deficiency has been linked to neural tube defects as well as increased risk of preterm labor. Though B12 deficiencies are rare, vegetarians and particularly vegans often dont get enough of this vitamin, since its found only in foods that come from animals. Ask your practitioner if you need more than what's provided in your prenatal vitamin; she can recommend a supplemental B12 as well as folic acid and ensure you're not getting too much of a good thing.How Much: 2.6 mcgper dayFoods to Eat: Vitamin B12-fortified soy milkFortified cerealsNutritional yeastFortified meat substitutesVITAMIN DWhy: This vital vitamin plays a role in building and maintaining healthy teeth and bones. Severe deficiency has been linked to complications including congenital rickets (a condition that causes the bones to become soft and weak, leading to poor growth and skeletal deformities) as well as bone fractures in newborns. The best dietary sources of vitamin D are milk and fish. If neither are part of your diet, a few minutes of sun each day helps your body produce vitamin D  though that can be tough, especially if you have darker skin, live in less-sunny climates, dont get outdoors a lot or wear sunscreen. You can get some vitamin D from fortified soy milk, breads, cereals and OJ, but usually not nearly enough. Fortunately, you can get what you need from a supplement. So ask your practitioner about testing your vitamin D levels and prescribing a supplement as needed.RELATED: 11 Best Foods to Eat While PregnantHow will a vegetarian or vegan diet effect my baby, and how will I know theres a problem?Theres every reason you can have a healthy pregnancy and baby, as long as you:Eat a well-balanced pregnancy diet, focusing on the above nutrientsTake your prenatal vitamin every dayVisit your doctor for all of your regular prenatal appointments, and dont hesitate to share any symptoms that concern you. Your doctor will monitor you for any potential issues and ensure youre not deficient in the nutrients you needWhat if I crave meat while Im pregnant?Given all those changes in hormones, lots of expecting moms find that their tastes in foods change somewhat or even a lot in pregnancy. And most pregnant women have food cravings, often for meat. If you feel okay about making an exception for meat during pregnancy, thats perfectly fine; you can get back to being vegetarian or vegan if you want after babys arrival. You may also want to consider just adding fish, eggs and dairy to your diet, if you dont eat them already; again, its not necessary. Otherwise, focus on eating your favorite protein-packed meat substitutes, which may help calm cravings.Can I stay vegetarian or vegan while Im breastfeeding?You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet if youre breastfeeding. However if your diet might be lacking some important vitamins and minerals (B12, zinc or calcium, if youre vegetarian or vegan)  and especially if your baby has health problems or was born prematurely  your doctor might recommend additional supplements for your baby. If you decide to feed your baby a vegetarian or vegan diet once he starts solids, be extra careful to ensure hes getting all the nutrients he needs.Updated 1/27/17"
Eating Fish During Pregnancy: What's Safe and What Isn't,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-fish-during-pregnancy/,"If youre unsure of the rules on fish and pregnancy, youre not alone: Theres been plenty of conflicting views over the years. Fish is heart healthy! But wait, it's also full of mercury. Fish is loaded with baby-friendly DHA! But not so fast  it's also loaded with PCBs. So whats the real dish on fish? The bottom line is that eating enough of the right types is not only healthy but recommended for both you and your baby. Heres the lowdown on whats safe and whats not when it comes to seafood.How Much Fish You Should EatSo how much seafood should you eat during pregnancy? In 2014 and again 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released joint statements encouraging moms to eat more pregnancy-safe fish. The groups said that expecting and breastfeeding women should eat 8 to 12 ounces (that's two to three servings) of low-mercury fish every week.Fish to Avoid During PregnancyThough the benefits of fish are many, you should still avoid a few types during pregnancy. Some  particularly large, ocean-faring, predator-types  contain high levels of mercury, a distinctly baby-unfriendly toxin. Others  especially those that live in polluted lakes and rivers  can be laden with PCBs, a chemical you definitely don't want to feed a fetus or an infant.To play it safe, the latest FDA and EPA recommendations suggest avoiding or limiting the following fish while you're pregnant and nursing:AvoidIt's best to avoid these seven types of fish, which are all higher in mercury: tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, marlin and king mackerel.Limit to one serving per weekThe following fish are considered ""good to eat,"" which means you can safely eat one serving per week (that's approximately 4 ounces): Bluefish, buffalofish, carp, Chilean sea bass, grouper, halibut, mahi mahi, monkfish, rockfish, sablefish, sheepshead, snapper, spanish mackerel, striped bass (ocean), Tilefish from the Atlantic ocean, albacore white tuna (canned, fresh or frozen), yellowfin tuna, weakfish/seatrout and white croaker/Pacific croaker. See the full list here.Exercise extra caution if you're planning to eat recreationally-caught fish: Check local state advisories for the waters where the fish was caught. If no information is available, stick to one serving of these fish per week, with skin and excess fat removed.Safe Fish During PregnancyDespite the long list of fish to limit during pregnancy, the vast majority of fish you'll find in the store and at restaurants are considered safe to eat when you're expecting at two to three servings (that's 8 to 12 ounces) per week. These include wild salmon, shrimp, catfish, tilapia, sole, flounder, haddock, halibut, ocean perch, pollock, cod, canned light tuna, crab, crawfish, lobster, hake, clams, black sea bass, anchovies and trout.Heard conflicting advice on salmon, too? Salmon's definitely one of nature's best providers of DHA. But to ensure you're not also feasting on the high levels of PCBs often found in farmed salmon, opt for wild (which also contains more of those healthy omega-3 fats) or organic farmed salmon.How to Properly Prepare FishBy now youve probably heard that you should avoid sushi during pregnancy  and the same goes for any other raw (oysters, ceviche, smoked salmon) or undercooked fish, since they can contain bacteria and parasites (like Listeria) that are dangerous for your developing baby.Here are a few tips to properly prepare fish and help reduce your exposure to any potential contaminants:Buy only fresh, properly refrigerated seafood. Store it in the fridge in a sealed container if youre not cooking it immediately.Use separate cutting boards for meats (including fish) and fruits/veggies.Dont reuse marinades.Cook seafood (all types, including shucked clams, oysters, shrimp, lobsterand scallops) until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 F; if a thermometer isnt available, youll know its done when the flesh is opaque (milky white); fish fillets should flake easily with a fork.Clams, mussels and oysters are cooked when their shells open; throw away any that dont.The Benefits of FishThe good news (at least for moms who enjoy seafood) is that fish really does offer big benefits for both pregnant women and their developing babies. Fish:Supports fetal growth. Fish is a first-rate source of lean protein, an essential amino acid that helps create all of babys cells  from skin and muscle to hair and bones.Is good for babys brain. What's more, fish (especially the fattier varieties, like salmon) is a source of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which has been shown to boost baby brain power. Its more important than ever in the third trimester, when your babys brain growth is fast and furious.Boosts your memory. Speaking of boosted brain power, getting enough omega-3s may also improve your memory  especially helpful when youre battling a case of pregnancy brain.Improves your mood: An adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids and especially DHA has been shown to decrease your risk of depression during pregnancy as well as postpartum depression.Supports your heart: A diet rich in fish may lower your risk of cardiac disease by reducing blood clotting and levels of triglycerides (blood fat) as well as lowering blood pressure if you have preexisting hypertension.May reduce risk of preterm birth. Scientists have observed that rates of preterm birth are lower in areas with a high fish intake  and some studies have indeed linked adequate omega 3 intake (whether through fish or supplements) to a lower risk of preterm birth.See more tips foreating well while pregnant.Updated 1/23/173 things to read next:8 Protein-Rich Foods (Plus Great Ways to Eat Them!)Foods High in Omega 3 Fatty AcidsYour Pregnancy Diet [INFOGRAPHIC]"
"Women Might Be Able to Eat During Labor After All, Admits New Study",http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/women-might-be-able-eat-during-labor-new-study-finds/,"What if I asked you to run a marathon, with just one catch: You couldn't eat anything before or during your race  in the off-chance you might suddenly need emergency surgery while approaching the finish line?Im guessing you would completely scoff at me. Yet thats exactly what hospitals ask women during labor and childbirth to do.Thankfully, a new study is adding to the growing evidence in support of letting laboring women eat.  Prescriptions for Crohn's Learn about a Treatment Option. See What's Possible for Your Crohn's. CrohnsTreatment.com/Prescription   What the Study FoundThe study, released by Obstetrics & Gynecology, looked at a total of 3,982 laboring women and analyzed how letting them freely eat affected labor outcomes, the babys health and C-section rates. Overall, it found that eating during delivery had absolutely zero negative repercussions. It didnt even (gasp) make women vomit, like many an old-school doctor told me would happen during my time as an OB nurse.Historically, women have always eaten during birth, because, well, its kind of common sense that when theyre going through one of the most physically and emotionally challenging experiences of their lives, they might need a little nourishment. There were even special traditions and customs that women in different cultures had surrounding food during labor  for example, some would bake a groaning cake to distract them through their contractions while others drank special brews to keep them calm. (Spoiler alert: They usually contained alcohol!)After the 1940s, however, doctors began restricting women from eating during labor. Their reason? They feared that should women need an emergency C-section, any food in their stomachs could wind up in their lungs, which wasusually fatal.That risk has changed today for two main reasons: 1) most C-sections, even emergency ones, do not use general anesthesia, which is when that complication can occur 2) the actual number of emergency C-sections using general anesthesia is very low anyway, because it poses major risks to both Mom and baby.Even without the fear of a C-section, certain doctors have other reasons for discouraging eating during labor. Some view it as pointless, since women are getting hydrated through an IV and because during transition, when women fully dilate, they may get sick and vomit, a completely natural occurrence.But with the length of labor being so different for every woman  like, absurdly different  is it pointless to fuel up, especially for those enduring particularly drawn-out deliveries? One study found an average length of labor to be over 13 hours, and lets keep in mind that most of that is latent, early labor, when a woman isnt yet experiencing full-blown contractions. In other words, nearly a whole day can pass for a mom-to-be with nary a bagel or a banana to be had.Although the tide has been turning toward allowing women to eat during labor, former methods die hard, especially in hospital settings.What This Means for YouThis latest study is an encouraging step in the right direction. Soon it may become more common practice to encourage women to at least snack during labor, especially if lack of nourishment isnt helping them maintain the strength they need for delivery or if their labor is protracted.If youre a woman who cant imagine giving birth on an empty stomach, its worthwhile to speak to your medical practitioner or midwife about whether you can bring some treats with you to the delivery room or if you can be served a meal at the hospital. Your doctor may even be able to recommend foods that are packed full of energy and will sit well in your stomach through all the contractions  and as you reach the finish line to meet the ultimate prize, your newborn baby."

Experts Say Raw Eggs May Be Safe for Pregnant Women in the UK to Eat—But What About in the U.S.?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/experts-say-raw-eggs-safe-for-pregnancy-in-UK-what-about-the-US,"Yesterday,a reportfrom a branch of the UK government announced a particular type of eggs are safe for women to eat raw during pregnancy, a controversial move as it directly contradicts a basic pregnancy guideline that the same group supported just 15 years ago.Most experts would advise againsteating raw eggs if you're pregnantbecause theres a risk that uncooked eggs are contaminated with the bacteria salmonella. When most people are exposed to salmonella, they only have typical not-so-fun symptoms of food-borne illness (vomiting, diarrhea, etc.). But for any case, there is a small risk of sepsis, which can result in serious complications for expecting women, whose immune systems are compromised.The group behind this announcement isthe Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food, which advises the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the British version of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In its last report in 2001, the committee agreed that eating raw eggs, eggs with runny yolks or any food that is uncooked or only lightly cooked may cause food poisoning in expecting women.But in the past 15 years, the safety standards of egg producers have changed drastically enough to reduce the chance of infection for people most at risk. That's why the newly-released report describes a VERY LOW risk level"" of salmonella contamination from eggs produced under certain regulations and states these eggs can be served ""raw or lightly cooked"" even to people most ""vulnerable to infection,"" such as ""pregnant women, the young and the elderly."" This applies both at home and in restaurants.Before you start downing your eggs sunny-side up, though, know that the FSA, which this group advises,has not yet changed its guidelinesfor pregnant women - even though it has started a two-month investigation into the recommendations to determine if the groups guidelines should be updated.Any changes itmightmake will be due to theBritish Lion Code of Practice, created in 1998, which requires animals be vaccinated against salmonella and other hygienic procedures to keep eggs from coming into contact with bird feces. The Lion Code also enforces an independent audit to test chickens for the bacteria, a tracking system and higher animal welfare standards (including more space for chickens to rangeanotoriously controversial issue in the U.S.that has so far onlybeen addressed by California law).Not all eggs sold in the U.K., however, are subject to these standards. And the group notes that outbreaks and cases of salmonella infection in people are predominantly associated with non-UK eggs.So what about in the U.S?According to the FDA website, there are regulations in place to help prevent contamination of eggs on the farm and during shipping and storage, and consumers also play a key role in preventing illness linked to eggs. But the program isnt as intense as in the U.K.For one, chickens arent vaccinated against salmonella, and because eggs are so widely eaten in the U.S., making such changes could be pricey, says Allison Bryant Mantha, M.D., an OB-GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital. Until the U.K.s Lion Code has been proven as both effective and cost-friendly, its unlikely a similar program would be adopted in the U.S.  which means itll be a while before raw eggs are on the menu for expecting moms in the U.S., if ever.Whats more, she explains, raw or undercooked eggs also carry a risk of listeriosis infection (a bacteriamost commonly associated with raw milk and cheese, which can live in food processing plants), which is dangerous for pregnant women. So for now, she says, ACOG continues to recommend that expecting women dont eat raw or undercooked eggs in the U.S.Bottom line: There are lots of pregnancy-friendly nutrients in well-cooked eggs  like DHAand choline, which are great forbabys developing brain. So keep on swapping those sunny-side up eggs for a scramble."

The person then went on to comment on his scrawny ankles, leg rolls and resting b&tch face.SEE ALSO: Your Newborn's Weight: What's Normal, What's NotAs a woman, I have witnessed, participated in, and been subjected to my fair share of body shaming. I teach physical education and own a personal training studio, so the business of bodies is basically my job. On any given day, I listen to questions, concerns, and comments -- both praise and criticism -- about bodies.  Treating Crohn's Disease - FDA Approved Treatment Option Assess Your Symptoms of Crohn's Disease & Learn about a Treatment Option.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Assessment   When I was pregnant, it was worse. People who felt the need -- actually, felt like they had the right -- to comment on my ever-changing figure. Insensitive comments like, ""You're having a girl! I can tell because you're carrying all in your thighs!"" (Side note: I have two sons.) Or, ""You must be having a BIG baby! You have HOW many months to go?""I'm an adult (most days), so I can handle those comments. But having children makes you realize that you're not alone in this body-obsessed world! Just think about how often a baby's size comes up in conversation. From the moment a baby is born, she is judged on her birth weight. Over 9 pounds? Ooooh, she's a tank! What a little chubster! Under 7 pounds? She's like a little doll! Your delivery must have been a breeze! 8 pounds? She looks so much smaller! Over 10 pounds? Your child is a beast and must need to be fed at.all.times.Especially within the first year, a baby is constantly subjected to comments about their weight. Why does a new mom need to hear that she has a giant man-like spawn for a son? Is it a compliment to go up to a baby girl and pretend to munch on her legs? Literally, in one day I heard comments such as, ""What in the WORLD are you feeding him?!"" to ""Oh, my sister has a friend who has a neighbor whose dog walker's baby weighs more than your son.""Alternately, a new mom -- especially a new mom whose baby was born premature -- surely doesn't need to hear how small her baby is. Hearing how tiny her baby is may be difficult if she is having problems feeding. Sometimes a mom's main cause of stress is the food her baby is or isn't eating. It may not seem insensitive at the time, but telling me how much your child weighs, down to the ounce, is not helpful. I understand it is ""just a baby,"" but why the obsession over weight? That being said, I'm guilty of it, too. I love asking a chubby baby with lots of arm rolls if she'd let me borrow one of her bracelets for the weekend. My nieces are so light in comparison to my sons, I swear sometimes I almost throw them right through the roof when I pick them up.A kid learns from a very young age that people judge others based on their size. They make assumptions about the person they're going to become -- ""He'll be a linebacker for sure!"" -- before the child can even hold their head up or say a word. I don't mean to have a stick up my a$$ about this, but in our body-obsessed culture, I just wish our babies weren't constantly subjected to comments about size. If you wouldn't tell a woman that she looks like she could eat an entire human for a meal, then maybe you shouldn't say the same thing about her baby.The truth is, babies are babies. Big babies are not always big adults, and small babies can be tall. Skinny babies are not unhappy babies, and chubby babies will not eat a 72-ounce steak for breakfast.MORE: Predict Baby's Height Like a ProInstead of telling a new mom that her baby is a beanpole, try asking her how she's doing. Ask her if she needs a hand instead of telling her that her baby has more rolls than a bakery shop.Or my personal favorite: Ask if you can get her a giant glass of wine.Now that's something we can size up.Do people make comments about your baby's weight?

These Whole Foods Ready Meals Could Cause Miscarriage in Pregnant Women,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0615/ready-to-eat-whole-foods-items-could-be-deadly-for-pregnant-women,"Over the course of several inspections in February of a Whole Foods' kitchen in Massachusetts, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) staff found multiple violations, including the presence of listeria on a food prep surface. The bacteria is especially dangerous to pregnant women.FDA reps sent a letter to Whole Foods last week describing the listeria contamination. After swabbing 100 surfaces throughout the facility, inspectors found a swab from the vegetable chopping machine tested positive for listeria. According to the FDA, this indicated that other surfaces were at risk of growing listeria, as well.Whole Foods Market North Atlantic Kitchen prepares ready meals for 74 stores inMassachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey, according to its Facebook page. Kitchen staff may have altered cleaning and food prep practices since the inspections.  Crohn's Disease Symptoms Experiencing Crohn's Symptoms? Get Info on How to Manage Them. CrohnsTreatment.com/Crohns-Therapy   But to be safe, if you are pregnant, avoid prepared meals, including salad bars, chefs' cases, sandwiches and wraps, in Whole Foods in the Northeast, especially those with chopped vegetables.The letter also outlined several other concerning violations, including:Ceiling condensation dripping on to preparation surfaces and food storage spacesDirty dishes piling up near foodHigh pressure hoses used for cleaning spraying into food prep areasToo much acid in solutions used to soak and treat vegetablesEmployees not washing their hands between tasksInadequate hot water at some sinksSanitizer to clean surfaces accidentally sprayed onto foodsEmployee clothing touching foodsThese violations affectedat leastthe following ready meals:Pesto pastaMushroom quesadillasEgg saladAnything with chives and beetsCouscousQuinoa cakesAnything with leafy salad greensChicken, turkey and other meatsEnchiladasSalad dressingsWhole Foods reps say they've addressed all of the problems listed in the letter and they don't know why the FDA didn't acknowledge these changes when they sent the letter months later.FDA reps say Whole Foods' response efforts up to this point have been inadequate, in part because Whole Foods management has not yet shared a plan for forcing this facility to comply with FDA regulations in the future. Last year, Whole Foods recalled deli pasta and curry chicken made at the same kitchen due to listeria contamination.Listeria is especially harmful to pregnant women, who are 13 times more likely to develop listeriosis if they come in contact with it though in general the risk is still very low. Unlike most other bacteria, listeria enters the bloodstream directly, and it can pass through the placenta, potentially causing miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth and meningitis in newborns.Common listeriosis symptoms includefever over 100.6F, muscle pain, backache, headache and diarrhea. If you think you've been exposed to listeria, call your doctor and see What to Expect's full guide to listeria and pregnancyfor more info."

Daycare and Obesity Risk: Good News Busy Parents Should Know,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/daycare-and-obesity-good-news-for-parents,"If you've heard people say that daycare can cause obesity and have worried about this connection when deciding to put your own child in daycare, then a new study should provide welcome relief. While previous research has in fact concluded that attending daycare may increase a child's obesity risk, a new study with more solid methods in thejournalPediatricsfound daycare actually has no effect on a child's weight.For the new study (the one that found daycare does NOT cause obesity), researchers observed more than 10,000 kids from birth through age 6 and monitored their weight using their Body Mass Index (BMI). About half the participants were cared for by someone other than their parent at some point during the study period, i.e. in daycare. Researchers found that of the children who attended daycare, about 37 percent were obese by the time they went to kindergarten, compared to 33 percent of those who stayed home with parents.If you look only at these percentages, it's natural that you'd conclude daycare increases obesity risk; after all, a greater percentage of daycare children became obese. But the Pediatrics researchers probed beyond these initial percentages to see if other aspects of a child's lifestyle could also be affecting his or her weight in a way previous research had not.  Treating Crohn's Disease - Take Control of Your Symptoms. Get Help Managing Your Crohn's Symptoms. Learn How to Set Treatment Goals.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Crohns-Goals   Because many of the children included in thePediatrics study went through phases of attending daycare and then phases of being cared for at home, researchers could look at a child's BMI during daycare phases andat-home-care phases to see if it went up when the child was in daycare. (Because BMI is a weight-to-height ratio, it won't increase simply because a child is growing.) Researchers found that, overall, children's BMIs did not increase during the daycare periods.So why are more kids in daycare obese? The question is still open, though it could have to do with lifestyle behaviors the study doesn't capture, likediet and exerciseoutsidedaycare.But regardless of whether your baby or toddler is in daycare, you should know these tips for keeping his or her weight in a healthy range:For babies, only feed when he or she is hungry. Babies are born knowing how to regulate their appetites, and theyll stop eating when theyre full.Wait tostart solidsuntil a baby is at least 4 to 6 months old, and skip juice until baby hits 6 months.Never prop up your baby with a bottle, and avoid using food to soothe or as a reward, no matter your child's age.For toddlers, have consistent snack and meal times (about six mini meals throughout the day) and avoid grazing. Let them feed themselves and stop when they're full.Servefruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy whenever possible, and skip processed foods.Look for ways to be active together. Even in babies, you can encourage sitting up, moving and playing.Attend all check-ups and bring up any concerns about weight to your child's pediatrician."
Meal-Planning Tips for Moms and Dads,http://www.whattoexpect.com/meal-planning-tips-for-moms-and-dads.aspx,"Five oclock has a way of sneaking up on you, doesnt it? You might be winding down the day with your munchkin or ready to leave the office when it hits you: What on earth is for dinner? To the rescue  these savvy meal-planning tips thatll save you money, free up precious time with your kiddo, and help your family eat more nutritiously and deliciously. Here are some ideas to get started:Be bargain savvy. Before you make your shopping list, check out that supermarket circular or scout out coupons in the newspaper. That way, you can plan your meals according to whats on sale. Is there a great deal on a menu staple like boneless chicken breasts or lean ground beef? Buy enough to stash some in your freezer for a second meal on the cheap down the road.Mix it up. Avoid the same-old, same-old by clipping or printing out uncomplicated recipes that make your mouth water. Consider filing them in a binder  slide your must-try meals into clear protector sheets to make your very own, very inexpensive cookbook. To widen your menu repertoire, each week pick a new recipe to try to determine which dishes are keepers. And remember, be open to new ingredients, especially grains and vegetables  it might encourage your toddler to try vegetables, too.Stick to simple. With all youve got on your plate, weeknights arent the time to try tricky dishes, no matter how much you admire Julia Child. Instead, save recipes with lots of steps, long ingredient lists, or complicated techniques for weekend kitchen sessions. Monday to Friday, think manageable meals like lean meatballs and whole-wheat spaghetti, turkey Reuben sandwiches, roast chicken and salad, and other quick dinner ideas.Stock up on staples. Fill your pantry and fridge with go-to basics like low-sodium chicken broth, whole-grain bread crumbs, olive oil, and eggs: This way your weekly grocery-shopping trip will be easier to manage. Plus, knowing youve got key ingredients on hand before you start prepping a meal makes the process a whole lot easier.Be flexible about food. Dont be a slave to scheduling  lets face it, as fun as Taco Tuesday sounds, things come up and you might decide at the last minute that you (or, more likely, your toddler) want nothing more than a bowl of cereal or PB and J. Save one slot a week for a leftover potluck and give yourself some extra wiggle room to switch things up so dinnertime stays low-pressure...and maybe even fun."
The Most Unhealthy Fast Food Meal in America,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/family-life/0703/the-most-unhealthy-fast-food-meal-in-america.aspx,"SUMMARY: The Center for Science in the Public Interest has completed laboratory tests showing that the most unhealthy fast food meal is the Big Catch from Long John Silver's. It's packed with fat and sodium, two of the worst offenders for promoting heart disease and high blood pressure.New research reveals what NOT to feed your kids. Extensive lab testing has determined the most unhealthy fast food in America: a fat-laden and sodium-packed fish meal from the restaurant Long John Silver's.According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the Big Catch meal is a ""heart attack on a hook."" The meal consists of a piece of battered haddock, hush puppies (deep fried cornmeal), and onion rings. It delivers 3,700 milligrams of sodium, which promotes high blood pressure and stroke, along with 19 grams of saturated fat and about 1,320 calories.  Crohn's Workaround Quiz Stop Working Around Crohn's. Take the Workaround Quiz & Learn More. CrohnsTreatment.com/Workaround-Quiz   Most concerning, however, is the astonishing 33 grams of trans fat in this fast food meal. That's more than 16 times higher than the daily limit recommended by the American Heart Association. Both saturated fat and trans fat are strong promoters of heart disease.Part of the problem is rooted in the partially hydrogenated oil used to fry the food. Many restaurant chains have stopped using this kind of oil altogether because of recent bad publicity, lawsuits, and government restrictions. But Long John Silver's is still using this type of oil for frying.Another problem is the fish itself. CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobsen notes that the company is taking an essentially healthy fish and ruining it by covering it with an oily crust. The company advertises its Big Catch as a 7 oz. piece of haddock, but the CSPI lab found that it's only about a 4 oz. piece of fish plus a 3 oz. crust of fat-drenched batter.The CSPI officially notified Long John Silver's CEO that the chain will face a lawsuit if it continues to use partially hydrogenated oils in food preparation. CSPI officials also notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its findings and urged the agency to withdraw its approval of these unhealthy oils, banning their use altogether.What does this mean for parents? For one thing, this particular meal is one to avoid if you're taking the kids out to dinner. But on an even more basic level, it's a reminder that fast food in general can be alarmingly unhealthy and should be limited. Nutritional information on fast food menus may be skewed (as the CSPI found with Long John Silver's menu), so even ""healthy"" items may seem healthier than they really are.The bottom line is what nutritionists, researchers, and government agencies have been telling us for decades: Eat more fruits and veggies, and eat less fast food. More nutrients, fewer empty calories from processed foods. It will make a huge difference in our health.Should partially hydrogenated oils be banned in fast food meals?

Enjoying Family Meals With Toddlers,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/eating-basics/enjoying-family-meals-with-toddlers.aspx,"Having a toddler at the table can turn family meal time upside down  and we dont just mean that bowlof spaghetti your darling dumped on the floor. Yes, toddlers can be squirmy, messy, and moody, but the benefits of family meal time are huge. For one thing, research shows that kids eat more fruits and veggies when families dine together, and theyre less likely to become overweight as they grow. The perkspay off in the long run too: Teens who show up for family dinners are less likely to smoke or drink and more likely to have better grades and talk abou twhats bothering them. Sure, some of those benefits are a long way off, but you can start laying the foundation for successful family meal times now, even while your tots still tiny.Schedule it right. Most toddlers hit the hay by 7 p.m., so family dinners have to be on the early side. This may be too early for working moms and dads, so try splitting the meal in to two parts. Your tot can dine with the parent whos home (even if he eats with just one of you,hell still reap the benefits of family meal time). Later, he can have a light snack or dessert with the second parent (or the two of you).Give him a job. Two things toddlers love doing are helping out and copying you, so take advantage by assigning some simple kitchen tasks. Between the ages of one and two, your sous chef can cook alongside you: Get him a mini apron (or tie a towel at his waist), and set him up in a safe spot with a wooden spoon and a pot. When hes two, he can tear lettuce for a salad, stir ingredients in a bowl (with a little help), fold napkins (well, sort of), and bring spoons to the table to help set it.ADVERTISINGOffer him (healthy) choices. At this age, your tot likes to have a say in everything, including what goes down his adorable little hatch. So offer three to four healthy options, including atleast two familiar faves  pasta and cheese, baby carrots and dip  and let him choose what (and how much) he wants to eat. To give his appetite a fighting chance at family meal time, limit late-afternoon snacking.Make it fun. If the meal is entertaining, your little one may linger a bit longer (but skip TV, Mom, because its way too distracting). Sing silly songs, give him a colorful straw for his milk, or try one of these special supper treats: Have a picnic on the family-room floor, serve breakfast for dinner, or set up a baked-potato bar and let your tot pick his toppings.Sethim free. Theres no such thing as the dinner hour when you've got a toddler at the table. In fact, ten minutes is probably the maximum amount of time your wiggle worm can sit without fidgeting. Instead of forcing him to stay put while you finish, let him play on the floor nearby. If he sees that the meal goes on without him, he may decide to rejoin you for a few more bites."
Quick Family Meals - Homemade Cheesy Rice,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/expectingtheunexpectedablogonmyjourneythroughpregn/quick-family-meals-homemade-cheesy-rice,"Yesterday, some leftover white rice in the fridge led me to come up with a new addition to my quick family meals repertoire. I thought to myself, ""How can I make this interesting, and appealing to Aden?""I decided to try making a quick macaroni and cheese type of meal using the rice. Since I've made macaroni and cheese before, I know that you need milk, cheese (obviously), flour, ground mustard, and just a pinch of paprika. Usually macaroni and cheese involves an egg to help it hold, but with quick family meals, you don't want to end up baking! So I combined those ingredients with the rice to make...voila!...cheesy rice!Sometimes we have a tough time finding vegetarian family meals that Aden finds appetizing. For instance, he won't touch Swiss chard, but he loves to nibble the ends off of roasted asparagus. He'll gobble down pasta, but he hates potatoes, whether they're mashed, roasted, or baked (he does love French fries though, but what kid doesn't?)

But the cheesy rice was such a hit that I wanted to share it on my blog so parents of fellow picky toddlers could try it out. And for vegetarian families out there, cheesy rice can make a good lunch or dinner idea for your vegetarian family meals.Here it is, my original recipe for lunchtime cheesy rice:CHEESY RICEHere's what you need:2 cups prepared white or brown rice1 TSP. olive oil1/2 cup milk2 oz. cheddar cheese1 TBSP. flour1/2 TSP. ground mustard1/2 TSP. paprikaHere's what to do:Pour the oil into a saucepan and stir in rice.

After this combination is heated through, add it to the rice and stir it in completely.

Nursing Mom in Jail Fights for Right To Pump Milk For Her Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/nursing-mom-in-jail-fights-for-right-to-pump-milk-for-her-baby,"Christina Milliner, mother to newborn Micah, was ordered to spend two weekends in a Michigan jail, and when she showed up to serve her time, officials told her she couldn't bring her breast pump which, it turns out, could be pretty illegal.Milliner was initially charged with retail fraud and then after failing to appear for multiple court-mandated meetings because of issues finding childcare, she says, she was given her sentence. The nuances of her case aside, Milliner and her baby, who was born prematurely, are still nursing. Breast milk is even more crucial for premature babies, yet the jail stood its ground in not letting her pump or nurse. At least at first.""As a result, I was in constant, excruciating pain,"" Milliner said in a statement. ""But worse than my pain was my fear that, by the time I was released, my milk would dry up and I would no longer be able to breastfeed my newborn, Micah. My baby was so tiny when he was born, and Micah's doctors had kept telling me how important it was that I breastfeed him. No mother should have to go through this  and certainly no child should either.""  Crohn's Disease Treatment Learn about a Treatment Option. See What's Possible for Your Crohn's. CrohnsTreatment.com/Crohns-Therapy   Fortunately, Milliner was able to file a complaint through the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which contacted the jail and county sheriff's department on her behalf. ACLU argued that because incarcerated people have a constitutional right to medical care and jails have an obligation to meet inmates' needs, officials were violating Milliner's civil rights. They immediately reversed their decision to deny her the right to pump and also vowed to create a policy that permits all nursing inmates to bring their own breast pumps.Regardless of what you think of Milliner, her mothering, or her crime, one fact about this case is clear: a breastfeeding mother has no control over whether her body will produce milk. Her milk ducts dont care if she is in jail, on top of Mt. Everest, or competing in the Olympics. They will just keep on doing their thing and making meal.To prevent a mother from pumping is not only foolish (because a mom needs to express milk, just like how she needs to pee and sweat), but its also harmful to both the mother and the child. A baby, especially a preemie, needs those nutrients, and if he hasnt ever had formula, introducing formula literally overnight risks dehydrating him if he refuses it. And without a pump, that poor mother could end up with mastitis, an incredibly painful breast infection, an abscess, and her supply could be diminished for the future as well.Not to mention, babies of incarcerated women are already suffering. Why make them suffer more by taking away a healthy meal?"

Formula-Feeding Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/bottle-feeding/formula-feeding-baby/,"There's not a lot of mystery behind feeding baby a bottle  for either you or your baby  since newborns can typically figure out how to use one pretty easily. But while breast milk is always on tap and ready to serve, formula must be chosen, bought, sometimes prepared and often stored  which means you'll need a lot of know-how before you mix up that first baby bottle. Whether you're formula-feeding exclusively or just supplementing, here's what you'll need to know to get started.Tips on Formula-Feeding Your BabyHere are some good-to-know tips for getting formula-feeding off to a good start:Snuggle up. The most important ingredient in any feeding session  breast or bottle  is love. The kind of skin-to-skin, eye-to-eye contact that's linked to optimum brain development and attachment in a newborn can be easily added to bottle-feeding. Nestle your baby close to you, take your time and extend the feeding session by chatting, singing or cooing to your baby once the bottle is drained. Need more ideas? These tips for bonding with your baby while bottle-feeding should help.Serve the bottle cold or at room temperature right from the start.It may come as a surprise, but there are no health benefits to heating up a bottle before a baby chows down. Its simply a matter of taste  some babies prefer their formula warm, while others like it cold or at room temperature. What that boils down to is this time-saving tip: Getting your baby accustomed to unheated formula early on will save you a lot of effort in the long run.If your baby ends up preferring bottles warm, use a bowl or pot of hot (not boiling) water or use a specially designed bottle warmer. Never heat formula in a microwave oven  the liquid may warm unevenly, or the container may remain cool while the formula has gotten hot enough to burn baby's mouth or throat.Don't worry about dark, smelly poop.Compare whats in the diaper of a breastfed baby with what's in that of a formula-fed baby and youll likely see some differences. In general, the stool of a formula-fed baby smells stronger, is darker in color and is firmer than that of a breastfed baby. But baby poop varies from infant to infant. Different smells and colors are nothing to worry about.Get the whole family involved. Dad, Grandma or an older sibling can share in the pleasures of feeding a baby when that baby is bottle-fed. Take full advantage by encouraging your loved ones to think of mealtime as cuddle time. By holding that little bundle close, gazing into his eyes, stroking his cheeks and singing him a lullaby, theyll be giving him a large dose of love as well as nutrition.Signs Baby's HungryIdeally, you should feed your baby at the first signs of hunger. Don't wait for tears; by then, your little one may be uncomfortably hungry, especially the longer he cries. He might be tiny, but he'll make his needs known by:Nuzzling against your breastsSucking furiously on his hands (or your shirt, or your arm)Opening his mouthRooting reflex(baby turns his head to the side with his mouth open to find the food source, often after his cheek is stroked)Sucking on his lip or tongue (which can look like he's sticking his tongue out)Making lip-smacking soundsIf he does cry, it will typically be a short, low-pitched wail that rises and fallsWhat Are the Different Types of Formula?You're bound to be a bit overwhelmed by the head-spinning selection of brands, varieties and prices you'll find in the formula section of the store or online. Where to begin?First, know that whichever kind you end up choosing for your little one's tiny tummy will provide your baby with quality nutrition. In fact, there are plenty of nutritionally sound options that come close to replicating nature's perfect recipe. So while no formula is packed with the immune molecules passed in breast milk from mother to baby, many have the same types and proportions of proteins, fats, carbohydrates,vitamins and minerals as breast milk. For example, most formula for infants now contains DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, respectively, that have been shown to enhance mental and visual development in infants and play an important role in brain function.Here's a look at the most common types of infant formula to choose from:Milk-based, iron-fortified formula.Cow's milk is a definite no-no for babies younger than 12 months because it's hard to digest and doesn't provide the complete nutrition developing infants need. But most formulas for bottle-feeding are made with cow's milk that's been modified for human babies. Proteins are altered to be easily digestible, milk sugar (or lactose) is added to more closely resemble breast milk, and vegetable oil is substituted for butterfat. Because iron is so essential for infant growth and development, both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the majority ofpediatricians recommend iron-fortified formula for most babies until at least their first birthday.Hydrolyzed formula.The protein content in this type of formula is broken down into smaller proteins, making it easier for baby to digest (which is why its also known as predigested formula). Theres a lot to consider about switching to hydrolyzed or even partially hydrolyzed formula (for one, its often more pricey), so be sure to talk to your pediatrician about options for bottle-feeding an allergy-prone baby before you make this choice.Soy-based formula.Originally popularized by dairy-averse vegans, soy-based formulas are made from soybeans supplemented with vitamins, minerals and nutrients. But because soy formulas differ more from human milk than cow's milk, they aren't usually recommended as a drink-of-choice except under certain circumstances (e.g. a cow'smilk allergy, though keep in mind it's common for infants with a milk allergy to also be sensitive to soy protein). The AAP maintains that soy-based formula should only be used in a handful of situations, like in the rare instance that a baby is intolerant to galactose.Special formula.Some bottle-feeding babies require special formulations, including premature infants, babies allergic to both cow's milk and soy formulas, and babies with metabolic disorders such as PKU. These infant formula products, which aren't necessary or recommended unless your pediatrician says so, are often hypoallergenic, lactose-free or especially easy to digest (and come with a particularly steep price tag).Organic formula.These come from milk products that are produced without the use of pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics or growth hormones, and for that reason are considered healthier by some doctors. However, certain organic infant formulas are sweetened with cane sugar (sucrose), which is significantly sweeter than the sugars commonly used in formula and which, some experts worry, could contribute to problems like tooth decay and excess weight gain. Not all organic formulas use sucrose, however, so check the labels and if you still have questions, ask your pediatrician.Probiotic and prebiotic formula.Some formulas for babies are now fortified with probiotics, a bacteria that's supposed to prevent diarrhea in otherwise healthy children. Probiotics should not be given to chronic or seriously ill babies, and according to the AAP, the jury is still out on whether or not they're effective intreatingdiarrhea or preventing any other conditions. Prebiotics are also added to some formulas in order to reduce infections in healthy children, but it's still uncertain whether or not they're effective, either.Follow-up formula.These formulas are geared toward bottle-feeding babies older than 4 months who are also eatingsolid foods. They're not a good choice for a younger baby, though. You should always ask your doctor before introducing them to the menu.What's the Best Formula for My Baby?The vast selection of formulas on store shelves can be dizzying  and more than a little confusing. Here are some smart tips to help you find the right one for your baby:Check with the pediatrician. Your baby's doctor can help you narrow the formula field, so ask for a recommendation first. Every baby is different, and while the majority of newborns do best on standard cow's milk-based formula, a small percentage may need something special (because of low birth weight or an allergy or intolerance, for instance).Steer clear of low-iron formulas. The AAP and mostpediatricians recommend that babies be given iron-fortified formula from birth until 1 year to prevent anemia.Don't assume that special formulas are better formulas. If you're considering trying a specialty formula (say, one that's soy-based), always ask the doctor before you stock up. Specialty formulas tend to be much more expensive than standard formula and aren't always necessary.Be wary of switching formulas too quickly. It may be tempting to try a new type of formula the minute your munchkin spits up. But spitting up doesnt necessarily signal a problem with what a babys eating (spit-up happens). Most pediatricians recommend staying with a formula for at least one week instead of switching too frequently, which can cause digestive issues for baby.Theres no getting around it: Formula can be expensive. You can expect to shell out an average of $1,400 on it before your babys first birthday. Prices vary depending on the type of formula you use (powder, concentrate or ready-to-feed), and specialized formulas can be up to 20 percent more expensive than the standard, iron-fortified, cows-milk variety.The least expensive option is powdered formula that you mix yourself. Moving up the cost scale is liquid concentrate (just add water), and finally  at the top of the formula pyramid  ready-to-feed formula.Looking for a way to keep cost down but not ready to fully give up on convenience? One approach is to splurge for the convenience of ready-to-feed formula during your babys first few weeks when sleep is hard to come by  and the last thing you want to do is measure and mix at 2 a.m. Once your little one is sleeping more and your feeding routine is well-established, you may feel more up to the task of making bottles. If you're heading out for the day (or for a few), be sure to prep enough bottles to leave with your infant's caregiver and explain how to best give them to her.Another way to save on formula? Try registering on the manufacturers web site for coupons and/or rebate checks. Buying generic formula will also save you some bucks.How Much Formula Should I Give My Baby?Start your newborn out slowly. For the first week or so, your baby will probably take about 1 or 2 ounces at each feeding (every 3 to 4 hours or on demand). Gradually up the ounces, adding more as the demand becomes greater, but never push baby to take more than he wants. The same rules apply if you're combining formula with breast milk or using bottles to serve up milk you've pumped: Give your baby only as much as he's hungry for without forcing him to finish if he doesn't want to.A very general rule of thumb is to take your baby's weight and multiply it by 2.5  that's the total number of ounces to feed your baby over the course of a 24-hour period. So if your baby weighs 10 pounds, he should be drinkingroughly20 to 25 ounces per day  or about three to four ounces every four hours. Need more guidance? Check in with your pediatrician about how much to give your baby and use this guide about how much formula to feed as your baby grows.Is Formula Ever Bad or Unsafe for My Baby?Baby formula is safer and easier to use than ever. But you still have to be careful when buying, preparing and storing it. Follow these tips to make sure formula is as safe as possible for your baby. Always check the expiration date. If its expired, dont buy or use it. Same goes for cans or containers that are dented, leaky, rusty or otherwise damaged (even a pin-size hole can let in harmful bacteria).Mix it right.Check the directions to see whether the formula needs to be mixed with water and if it does, follow the measurements precisely. Formula thats underdiluted can lead to problems, including dehydration, while overdiluted formula can interfere with a baby's growth and proper nutrition.Always toss leftovers. Bacteria from a babys saliva can multiply in the bottle, so always toss any leftover formula. If youre worried about waste, offer up smaller servings and give him a refill if hes hungry for more.Keep prepared bottles of formula refrigerated until ready to use. If you're traveling away from home, store previously prepared bottles in an insulated container or a tightly sealed plastic bag with a small ice pack or a dozen ice cubes (the formula will stay fresh as long as most of the ice is frozen). Don't use pre-mixed formula that's no longer cold to the touch (it'll have to be tossed).Throw unused refrigerated formula away according to the instructions on the label. Refrigerated formula that's been opened or poured into bottles needs to be tossed after a certain amount of time, depending on what kind it is. Check the label and throw out anything you don't use in the amount of time specified.Still have some concerns about safe formula-feeding? Follow these simple tips about formula safety.Weaning From Breast to BottleReady to offer that first bottle to your breastfed baby? Your little one may have no trouble switching over and take a bottle easily right from the start, or he could need a bit longer to get used to this new way of eating. Keeping these weaning tips in mind will help transition your baby from the breast to the bottle without too many bumps.Easing into it gradually winds up working better for some babies. If your schedule will require you to miss two feedings during the day, for instance, switch to the bottle one feeding at a time, starting two weeks before you plan to go back to work or school. Give your baby a full week to get used to the single bottle-feeding before moving on to two. This will help your baby and your breasts adjust over time if you'll be supplementing with formula instead of pumping and feeding breast milk.No matter what, take heart in knowing that you'll find a formula your baby likes, learn the prep and storage ropes in no time, and settle into a good feeding routine so that it all becomes second nature before you know it."

"Breastfeeding Education Works Better than Banning Formula in Hospitals, Report Says",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/breastfeeding-education-works-better-than-banning-formula-in-hospitals-report-says/,"The strategy that most effectively leads moms to stick with breastfeeding for the recommended one year does not involve hospital-wide bans on formula or pacifiers but rather addresses the invidivual needs of moms through education and support, a new report from theU.S. Preventive Services Task (USPSTF) Force finds.USPSTF is a government-supported group that specializes in medical-data analysis and makes recommendations about preventative medical practices. Its last breastfeeding recommendations before this week came out in 2008.This time around, USPSTF compared systemic breastfeeding interventions, basically hospital rules designed to encourage breastfeeding, and individual interventions, giving moms one-on-one help, by reviewing 52 studies involving more than 66,000 moms.Report authors concluded, ""Breastfeeding support interventions are associated with an increase in the rates of any and exclusive breastfeeding.""While there's no evidence that a certain type of education is better than another, ""prenatal education, support at or around the time of delivery, and postpartum support"" worked best when a mom got all three.  Crohn's Disease Flare Up Find Out More about How Intestinal Inflammation May Cause Flare-Ups. CrohnsTreatment.com/Crohns-Flare-Up   That lactation support before, during and after childbirth helps moms long-term isn't exactly groundbreaking; other studies have found similar results, one in particular attesting that nurses are the secret ingredient to breastfeeding success. What's most interesting, though, is that there isn't much evidence supporting hospital-wide pro-breastfeeding guidelines.Since 2006, when the World Health Organization launched its ""baby-friendly hospital"" guidelines, more birthing facilities have implemented systemic interventions designed to encourage long-term breastfeeding, including bans on artificial nipples, discouring formula use, and requiring moms and babies to room in together, in addition to extra breastfeeding help.Critics of the initiative have said it ultimately removes choices for moms, who should be able to decide for themselves how to feed their infants. And now more experts are coming out saying these restrictions might have no effect and in rare cases could be harmful.An editorial which accompanied USPSTF's study in the Journal ofthe American Mediacal Associationwrote that the 9 studies touching on ""systemic interventions"" that the USPSTF looked provided ""no consistent association"" with ""beneficial outcomes,"" and also explained that practices around restricting pacifier and formula use could be problematic for infant health.For one, evidence shows that pacifiers can lower risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the most common cause of death in babies less than 1. In addition, babies whose moms have low milk production may be subject to dehydration and other conditions if they're only allowed to drink breast milk.While the USPSTF and the editorial authors are calling for more research on systemic interventions (nine studies isn't actually a lot), for now one thing is clear: the best approach to helping nursing moms is to provide abundant education and support and to respond to each mom's individual breastfeeding needs."

Unsurprising Study Finds Moms Feel Guilty No Matter How They Choose to Feed Their Babies,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/study-finds-moms-feel-guilty-for-formula-feeding-and-breastfeeding,"For what seems like the first time ever, a study is backing up the fact that mom guilt is very, very real. Especially when it comes to feeding, and if you choose formula. Or breastfeeding. Or to supplement. Or pretty much anything.The study, published in Journal of Maternal and Child Nutrition, looked at over 1,600 mothers with babies up to 26 weeks old and compared how they planned to feed their babies while they were pregnant to how they actually ended up feeding their babies -- and how those differences impacted them emotionally.The results were not that surprising, but are still telling:  Doctors Who Treat Crohn's - Find Crohn's Doctors Near You Experiencing Crohn's Disease Symptoms? Take the First Step to Getting Relief.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Locate-Doctor   Moms who planned to breastfeed but did not felt the most guilt. Mothers who planned on exclusively breastfeeding or started out exclusively breastfeeding, but then stopped felt the worst.Formula-feeding moms felt the need to justify their choice. Overall, the majority of formula-feeding mothers felt guilty and stigmatized.Moms who breastfed but supplemented with formula also struggled with guilt.Mothers who breastfed exclusively reported lower levels of guilt than formula-feeding mothers, but they still had guilt over returning to work, nursing in public, and what family members would think of their nursing choices. (You know, like those snide comments that just about every breastfeeding mom definitely does not want to hear.)When it comes to feeding our babies, it can feel like there is no good solution. Breastfeeding might be the medically-preferred option, but not the option that your body or baby prefers. And even if you are able to nurse, there are trade-offs, like time, sleep and, you know, having another human depend on your boobs to live. No pressure! Formula moms may feel judged, worry if its the best choice or wish they could be breastfeeding.Feeding our babies is one of the very first acts of mothering that we do, so it feels like one we cant mess up. And because there is no such thing as a perfect solution, its inevitable we all feel at least a little guilty.I had mastitis almost the entire time I breastfed my two youngest children, which meant my babies were getting non-stop antibiotics through my milk for months. I wondered if it harmed them, and because breastfeeding took me away from my older kids, I felt bad about that, too.So moms of the world, how do we move past our guilt?Well, a massive societal shift toward respecting moms' choices, encouraging science-based practices but not condemning moms when it's not for them, and eliminating all the catch-22s for parents would be nice.But that could take a while. So for now, whether we're choosing how to work, discipline or get baby to sleep, let's just lose the guilt. It won't wont take us back in time so we can make a different choice. It won't change our circumstances, and it sure as heck wont benefit our kids. Loving yourself and trusting your instincts will.And just a reminder, Mama, because you definitely don't hear it enough, you're doing great."
"Know the Difference Between ""Natural"" and ""Organic""",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/0502/you-should-know-the-difference-between-natural-and-organic,"When you're opting for formula feeding instead of breast milk, knowing exactly what's in it can help you give baby the healthiest start in life. That's why the lawsuit against the Honest Companybaby product and home goods manufacturer started by mom of two Jessica Alba  for usingsynthetic ingredients despite ""organic"" labeling in itsPremium Infant Formulais so concerning.To be fair, the allegations are just that: allegations made by the Organic Consumers Association that have not been corroborated. The document states the formula contains 11 synthetic ingredients that are not allowed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to be in products labeled ""organic."" It's unclear where they got this number.Honest Co. reps responded with a blog post that outlines four ways they say their formula actually does meet USDA requirements and added that Alba's co-founder Christopher Gavigan developed the formula for his own son. According to the post, the product has been cleared by the USDA's National Organic Program(hence the label), is at least 95 percent organic ingredients, and is manufactured in line with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for infant formula.

Take the First Step to Getting Relief.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Locate-Doctor   The suit is still underway, and the ingredients of the formula still need to be analyzed. Until those results come back, you should understand why foods and other household products are labeled ""organic"" versus ""natural"" to decide how to best care for your family.What does a ""natural"" label mean?""Natural"" products are not tested by the USDA or the FDA, nor are they regulated to the same degree as those that are ""organic."" It's a designation that primarily refers to the final product's contents as opposed to the way it was made.For example, a food that's minimally processed might still contain synthetic ingredients, says Jennifer Lowry, MD, chief of toxicology at Children's Mercy hospital in Kansas City. Moreover, to label a product ""natural,"" companies must only have one justification for why it's ""natural."" So if a product is free of artificial sweeteners but contains fruits grown with pesticides, it can still be labeled ""natural.""Bottom line: The label of ""natural"" is used ""willy nilly,"" Lowry says.What does an ""organic"" label mean?An USDA Certified Organic label addresses both the final product and the way each ingredient in the final product was made.It must check every individual criterion that can make a product ""natural,"" in additon to using only ingredients farmed according to ""organic"" regulations. For example, organic farmers cannot use genetic engineering or synthetic fertilizers, and they cannot expose their produce to radiation.What should you look for in infant formula?A cow's milk base. These formulas are the most similar in composition to breast milk. If you're concerned about allergies or raising a vegan baby, ask your doc about alternatives.Organic label.If you can afford it, these products are recommended because they don't use milk from animals exposed to growth hormones, antibiotics or pesticides.Nothing ""special"" or ""low-iron."" Special formulas are usually overpriced and make false promises (""No more gas!"") with ingredients your baby probaly doesn't need. And iron-fortified is probably preferred for your growing tot. If your baby has special nutritional needs, ask your doc which formulas and additives will best meet these.Whatever your doc recommends. Always, always ask your doctor which formula to buy before trying one. He or she can tell you which products are best suited to your baby's unique needs.""Natural"" and ""organic"" are overwhelming buzz words, especially for stressed-out parents trying to choose between a million different product and food options for their babies. But Lowry says there's one extra important thing to know about these labels:Focus on giving your child all the right nutrients first and what qualifies ""organic"" or ""natural"" second. If you can't afford organic or natural, do your best to hit all the necessary food groups any way you can, even if that means canned, frozen or with pesticides. The benefits of that non-organic strawberry far outweigh the possible risks behind how it was grown.3 Things to Read Next:8 Things You Need to Know About Using Honest Suncreen on BabiesThe Simple Way Jessica Alba Copes with Mom GuiltWhat You Need to Know About Arsenic in Baby's Rice Cereal"

Mom Perfectly Captures Struggle of Having a Hungry Newborn But Not Enough Milk,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/this-is-what-it-feels-like-to-have-a-hungry-newborn-but-not-enough-milk,"While breastfeeding is beautiful, bonding and natural, it can also involve long nights, tears from both mom and baby, fevers, mastitis and lots of mixed emotions.Another common problem few women expect is that your supply might not meet your baby's demand(at least in the beginning), an emotional blow new mom Heyona Cho perfectly described in a recent Instagram post.The feeling you get when your newborn cries for milk is hard to describe, Cho writes.The heartbreak you feel when your newborn cries and you don't have milk is even harder to describe. Nevermind that the nipples are cracked and sore, baby's cries sound like ringing alarms inside the brain and I'm desperate to do anything to alleviate his discomforts and meet his needs.As a mom of four, I definitely know the pain Cho is talking about, and Im grateful shes sharing her story. After getting mastitis many times, I was left with one breast that made milk, and it was so hard to feed my baby. Like Cho said, every choice I made felt like the wrong one. Either I fed my baby formula and felt defeated, or I pushed through with significant pain and discomfort.This must be an unspoken reality for SO many new moms, Cho continues. I speak to myself and whoever may be struggling to feed their newborn. Feel no guilt or shame ... Some things we just cannot control, and so, we will make the best choices that we know how...And shes so right. Besides spreading the message that its OK to talk about our breastfeeding struggles (and her happy ending thanks to her increasing supply and milk donations) Cho reminds moms to let go every once in a while.Every decision we're faced with will have the same outcome: We will do the best we can because we love our babies, and that's all that matters.You may not have enough milk at the moment, but you are more than enough for your baby, always."
The Surprising Thing That Helps Moms Breastfeed Successfully,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/nurses-help-breastfeeding-success/,"Having confidence in the ability to breastfeed has been linked to successful nursing, including breastfeeding exclusively and for a longer period of time without supplementing with formula, research has shown.Now, a new study reveals a surprising way moms can get that confidence they need to boost their chances of breastfeeding success: with the help of their nurses.Nurses can be instrumental in the early days after a woman gives birth by encouraging her to believe in her ability to breastfeed, according to the study published in the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing.  Treating Crohn's Disease Get Help Managing Your Symptoms. Learn about a Treatment Option. www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Treatment   Lead author Katherine Hinic, PhD, RNC, APN, an assistant professor at the College of Nursing in Seton Hall University, examined some factors that can affect a new mothers confidence in her ability to breastfeed, such as how much stress she felt during and after childbirth and how satisfied she was with her labor and delivery experience.The researchers surveyed 107 women in the first four days after they gave birth and found that their confidence in their own ability to nurse successfully was higher among women who had greater satisfaction with their baby's delivery, strong breastfeeding support from their partners, previous experience with breastfeeding, an intention to breastfeed and the feeling that they were prepared for childbirth.That self-confidence when it came to nursing was found to be lower in women who were given formula in the hospital.While the study is somewhat limited (the number of mothers looked at was relatively small, and they were all from one medical center in the Northeast), it highlights the important role nurses play in new moms' experience with breastfeeding.Though the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for the first six months of life, up to 60 percent of women stop nursing earlier than planned. These findings show that certain interventions by nurses, including limiting the amount of formula given to moms in the hospital, involving women in decision-making during delivery, giving new moms the chance to have skin-to-skin contact with their newborns shortly after birth and involving partners in breastfeeding education can all help build women's confidence in nursing and allow them to have a positive birth experience.That, in turn, ups their chances of breastfeeding exclusively and for longer both of which are good for mom and baby."
Introducing Solid Foods to Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/introducing-solid-foods/,"Introducing solid foods is one of the most exciting (if messy) milestones of your baby's first year. Think of all the tastes and textures that await your little one  from savory cheese to juicy mango to creamy avocado. There's a whole world of flavors to discover and explore, and starting solids is the first step. Encourage your baby to enjoy herself while trying new foods, even if a good portion of them ends up on her bib, the tray or the floor. It's all part of the great experiment of taking those taste buds to the next level.WHEN CAN MY BABY START SOLIDS?Most babies are ready to start solids between 4 and 6 months, but your little one's individual development definitely tops the list when deciding whether or not it's time to graduate to a more varied diet. Though you might be eager to hop on the feeding bandwagon sooner rather than later, there are plenty of reasons why starting a baby on solids too soon isn't smart.First, a very early introduction to solids can occasionally trigger allergies. And a young baby's digestive system  from a tongue that pushes out any foreign substance placed on it, to intestines still lacking many digestive enzymes  is unready developmentally for solids. Plus, solids aren't necessary early on  babies can fill all their nutritional needs for the first 6 months of life from breast milk or formula alone.Bringing on the solids too soon can also undermine future eating habits (baby may reject those spoonfuls initially simply because she isn't ready, then may reject them later because of previous parental pushing). And especially in formula-fed babies, early introduction of solids can lead to obesity later on in childhood and beyond.On the other hand, waiting too long  say, until 8 or 9 months  can also lead to potential pitfalls. An older baby may resist being taught the new (and challenging) tricks of chewing and swallowing solids, preferring to cling to the tried-and-true (and easy) methods of breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. And, like habits, tastes can be harder to change at this point. Unlike the more pliable younger baby, an older baby may not be as open to solids when milky liquids have long monopolized the menu.SIGNS MY BABY IS READY FOR SOLIDSTo decide if your baby is ready for the big step into the world of solid foods at 4 months, not till 6 months, or somewhere in between, look for the following clues  and then consult your doctor:Your baby can hold her head up well when propped to sit. Even strained baby foods should not be offered until then. Chunkier foods should wait until a baby can sit well alone, usually not until 7 months.The tongue thrust reflex has disappeared. Try this test: Place a tiny bit of baby-appropriate food thinned with breast milk or formula in your baby's mouth from the tip of a baby spoon or your finger. If the food comes right back out again with that tiny tongue, and continues to after several tries, the thrust is still present and baby isn't ready for spoon-feeding.Your baby reaches for and otherwise shows an interest in table foods. If she's grabbing the fork out of your hand or watching intently and excitedly with every bite you take, that may be a sign that she's hungry for more grown-up fare.Your baby is able to make back-and-forth and up-and-down movements with the tongue. How can you tell? Just watch carefully.Your little one is able to open wide, so that food can be taken from a spoon.WHAT ARE THE BEST FIRST FOODS TO FEED BABY?No matter what's on the menu, the texture of yourbaby's first foodsshould be super smooth and practically dripping off the spoon. If you prepare your own food, you should strain, puree or finely mash it, and then thin it with liquid if necessary. As your baby becomes a more experienced eater (usually around 7 months or older), gradually reduce the liquid you add and thicken the texture. Here are three foods to start with:Cereal. If you start with baby cereal, pick a single-grain, iron-enriched, whole-grain variety, like brown rice, whole-grain oat or whole-grain barley. To prepare, mix a small amount of baby cereal with formula, breast milk or even water to create a creamy ""soup."" Don't sweeten the taste by adding things like mashed bananas, applesauce or juice  first, because it's best to introduce only one food at a time, and second, because it's better for baby to acquire a taste for plain before you sweeten the cereal pot.Vegetables. Start with milder yellow or orange options such as sweet potatoes and carrots before moving on to the green team, like peas and string beans, which have slightly stronger flavors. If your baby rejects what you give her, try again tomorrow and the next day and the next. Some babies need to be introduced to a new food four or five (or more!) times before they'll accept it, so perseverance is key.Fruit.Delicious, digestible first fruits include finely mashed bananas, baby applesauce, peaches and pears. For something completely different, and completely baby-friendly, start with smoothed-down mashed or pureed ripe avocado  it's creamy, yummy and loaded with healthy fats.Otherwise, you might want to adopt an approach that's often called ""baby-led weaning,"" which bypasses pureed solids in favor of gummable solid foods presented in thick, long pieces, which younger babies can hold in their fists. (However, the pincer grasp, which enables babies to make the leap to finger foods, doesn't usually develop until around month 8.)HOW CAN I HELP INTRODUCE SOLID FOODS TO MY BABY?One of the first and best steps in raising a good eater is to model healthy enjoyment of food yourself. Babies who see adults eating good food and enjoying it are more likely to be interested in following their example. A few more tips to help your baby discover solids:Time it right. The ""perfect"" time of day to feed your baby is whatever time works for both of you. If you're breastfeeding, you might try solids when your milk supply is at its lowest (probably late afternoon or early evening). Experiment: Offer a first course of formula or breast milk to whet that appetite, then bring on the solids. Start with one meal per day, then move up to two (probably a morning and evening meal) for the next month or so.Monitor baby's mood. As trying as those first feedings may be for you, they're even more of a challenge for your little one. So keep in mind that a baby who's cheerful and alert is more likely to open wide for an incoming spoon, and one who's cranky or getting sleepy may want only breast (or bottle). If your baby is fussy, be flexible  you might want to skip solids at that meal and try them next time.Don't rush. Food is never fast when it comes to babies  you'll be surprised at how long it takes to get one little spoonful into that little mouth (and ultimately down the hatch). Give yourself and your baby plenty of time for feedings  and get plenty of practice, too. You'll need it.Sit pretty. Holding a squirming baby on your lap while trying to deposit an unfamiliar substance into an unreceptive mouth is a perfect recipe for disaster. Before your baby actually takes bite one, let her practice sitting in the high chair or feeding seat for a couple of days, adjusting the height of the tray or seat so it fits just right. And dont forget how wiggly your little worm can be  always fasten the safety straps, including the one around the crotch. If baby cant sit up at all in such a chair or seat, it's probably a good idea to postpone solids a little longer.Gear up. Skip the silver spoon  a silicone, plastic or corn-based model with a small, soft bowl is much easier on tender gums. Count on having several on hand during feedings (one for you, one for baby and a spare when one lands on the floor) to foster baby's sense of independence and avoid power struggles (yes, those happen even at this age). And while youre gearing up, a word to the wise: Don't forget to put a bib on baby right from the start or youll face big-time resistance later.Make some introductions. Before even attempting to bring spoon to mouth, put a dab of the food on the table or high chair tray and give baby a chance to examine it, squish it, mash it, rub it and maybe even taste it. That way, when you do approach with the spoon, what youre offering wont be totally unfamiliar.Ease in. For someone whos brand new to the concept of spoon-feeding  and all the new textures that go with it  solids can come as a bit of a shock. So ease in. Start by gently placing about a quarter teaspoon of food on the tip of babys tongue. If thats swallowed, place the next quarter teaspoon a little farther back. At first, expect almost as much food to come in as goes out. Eventually your little one will get the hang of spoon-feeding  and respond mouth-open.Count on rejection. Even bland tastes can be acquired tastes for a brand new solids eater. Babies may reject a new food several times or more before they decide to like it. So dont push when baby snubs what the spoon is delivering. But do try again another day.Invite imitation. What your baby monkey sees, she may be more likely to do. It's an old parent trick but a goodie: Open up wide and take a pretend taste from the spoon  and don't forget to smack your lips and relish your make-believe bite enthusiastically.Know when enough is enough. Knowing when it's time to stop feeding is as important as knowing when to start. A turned head or a clenched mouth are sure signs that baby is finished with this meal. Forcing a baby to eat is always a lost cause  and can actually set up future food fights.Need more help? These extra tips introducing solid foods to your baby should do the trick.WATCH FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONSWhilefood allergiesare pretty common in babies, kids usually outgrow them  though you do need to take them seriously. Babies' reactions to food can range from gassiness, diarrhea or mucus in the stool to vomiting and rashes  especially around the mouth or bottom. Other symptoms include a runny nose, watery eyes, wheezing that doesn't seem to be due to a cold and unusual wakefulness or crankiness, day or night.If you think your baby may be allergic to something you've fed her, wait about a week before trying the food again. If you get a similar reaction two or three times in a row, you can probably assume she's sensitive to it. Eliminate that food from her diet for several months, then try it again if your pediatrician gives the green light. If your baby seems to react to almost every new food you offer, or there's a history of allergies in your family, wait a full week between trying any new item, and do check in with your doctor.HOW DO I PREVENT CHOKING?Here's what to do to prevent choking when solid food is on the menu:Stay close.At this point, eating should be a spectator sport, with you closely watching every bite your baby takes.Start small. Cut food into pieces tiny enough that your baby can swallow them whole if she doesn't spend any time gumming them (enthusiastic eaters often gulp them down).Get bigger slowly. As your baby gets used to eating pieces of soft, solid food (and as you get more comfortable watching her eat them successfully), gradually move upfrom minced to chopped to small cubes.Keep the portions baby-sized. Place only one or two chunks at a time on the plate or tray so she doesn't stuff in more than she can handle.Stay seated. Not you, but baby. Offer finger foods to your baby only when she's sitting down  not crawling, cruising or toddling around. Eating on the run isn't just bad manners; it's unsafe for the inexperienced eater.Stay safe. Don't give your baby foods that won't dissolve in the mouth, can't be mashed with the gums or can be easily sucked into the windpipe. Avoid uncooked raisins, whole peas (unless they are smashed), raw, firm-fleshed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers) or fruit (apples, unripe pears, grapes), large chunks of meat or poultry, and common choking hazards including popcorn, nuts, chunky nut butters and hot dogs.WHAT NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN INTRODUCING SOLIDSAlarming as it might seem, if your baby gags during her first encounter with any kind of food, her reaction is normal. When a baby gags, its a sign that she has either taken in too much food or pushed it too far back in her mouth. In either case, the gag reflex is what helps her get that food all the way out of harm's way (and, usually, all the way back out onto the bib or tray in the process).Make sure your baby is sitting upright in her chair, offer manageable servings and be sure to learn the difference between gagging and choking. A child who is choking will look terrified, will not be making any sounds and will be unable to breathe; a baby who is experiencing a gag reflex will be coughing and making sounds.Also, if most of what you serve your baby ends up on the floor or otherwise uneaten, it's not a cause for concern, aside from any completely legit worries you might have about wasting food (and you can help conserve food and prevent waste by keeping serving sizes small). Your baby's first experiments with food are more about the ""experiment"" and less about the food  more about gaining experience than gaining sustenance, in other words. The bulk of your child's nutritional needs for the first year are still going to be met by breast milk or formula.Also, although it was once common to delay giving a baby certain foods like dairy, eggs, seafood and nuts in the hopes of staving off allergies,the AAP no longer recommends doing sosince the data shows that holding off on certain foods does not prevent food allergies. In fact, in 2015,the AAP said that introducing allergenic foodslike peanut butter earlier in a child's lifein the4- to 11-month rangeactuallyreducesher chances of developing a food allergy.Just be sure you've successfully introduced a couple of other solids (cereals, fruits or vegetables) first, and be sure to introduce the foods one at a time at home (not, say, at baby's day care center).Not so sure what's best for your baby? Check with her pediatrician.WHAT WILL MY BABY BE READY FOR NEXT?Those early-bird specials (rice cereal, applesauce, bananas, yellow veggies) get pretty old after a few dozen meals. Spice things up (at around 7 or 8 months) by adding minced meat (chicken, lamb, turkey or beef), mashed eggs and avocado to her repertoire. By 8 months (and possibly even sooner), whole-milk yogurt, cheese, pasta, beans and tofu can make their debuts, and thenfinger foodsadd a whole other dimension to eating.Ready to serve up a combo platter? That's fine, as long as you keep the foods separate for a while. Your goal is to get your baby acquainted (and happy) with the taste of particular foods, so if you mush the meats and veggies together, she may never know the joy of just plain peas. Once she likes the taste of a variety of different flavors, feel free to mix things up.Always hold off on honey (which can contain spores ofClostridium botulinum,a bacteria that is harmless to adults but can cause botulism, a serious illness, in babies) and cow's milk until your baby is at least 1 year old. Most doctors will, however, green-light whole-milk yogurt, cottage cheese and hard cheese by 8 months or so, or even sooner.If all this sounds complicated, take heart: In some ways, feeding a baby is easier than satisfying sophisticated older palates. Baby's first solid foods can be served cold, slightly warmed or at room temperature. And don't worry about adding salt, sugar or other spices  even the mildest pureed squash is an adventurous new taste and sensation for a little one just starting out."
Your Newborn’s Weight: Normal Gains and Losses and What the Average Baby Weighs,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/health-and-safety/newborn-weight-average-gains-loss/,"If theres one way in which parents want their babies to be average, it might be when it comes to weight. Too low and parents fret that their little ones are, well, too little or perhaps ill; too high and they start to worry about obesity. But heres some news that might help you relax: There's a wide range of healthy weights when it comes to newborns, and as long as your baby is eating, peeing and pooping, theres probably no cause for concern.What Factors Contribute to Your Newborn Babys Weight?What makes your baby weigh more or less than the newborn in the next bassinet? Several factors come into play:Your own diet and weight, both before and during pregnancy (if youre overweight, you may have a heavier baby; if you dont get enough nutrients while youre pregnant, your baby may be smaller)Your prenatal health, including whether you drink, smoke or have diabetesYour own birth weight, plus genetics (your size at birth, plus your and your hubbys size now, can both play a role)Your age (teen moms tend to have smaller babies)Whether your baby is a boy or a girl (boys tend to be heavier)Whether this is your firstborn (they tend to be smaller than subsequent children)Whether your baby is a twin or triplet (multiples tend to be smaller than singletons)Your babys race (Caucasian babies are sometimes larger than African-American, Asian or Native American infants)What Does the Average Newborn Weigh?At birth, the average baby weighs about 7.5 pounds, and 95 percent of newborns will be between 5.5 and 9.5 pounds. If your baby falls within this range at birth, theres probably no reason to be concerned about her size. If shes bigger or smaller than that, your practitioner might recommend some extra tests or monitoring to make sure she stays healthy.Newborn Weight LossDont be alarmed to learn that, upon discharge from the hospital or birthing center, your baby will weigh on average 5 to 10 percent less than she did at birth. Whats up with the downturn? Shes just losing fluid, which is normal right after delivery. And because she doesnt need a lot of food right now (a good thing since breast milk wont arrive for a couple of days postpartum), she wont gain those ounces back right away. Not to worry  within five days, she should start gaining weight again, and within 10 to 14 days, shell be back up to her birth weight, if not beyond.Newborn Growth SpurtsYour pediatrician will monitor your babys weight at well-baby checkups, most likely at 1, 2 and 4 weeks of age. (If your practitioner schedules fewer appointments, feel free to bring your baby in for a weight check anytime.) Plus, many nursing and new mom support groups have baby scales so you can get a quick read. Dont go by your scale at home  its not sensitive enough to pick up on those fractions of an ounce that matter when it comes to newborn weight!Typically, once theyre back to their birth weight, new babies gain 6 to 8 ounces a week for the first few months  thats 1 to 2 pounds a month. After about 4 months, formula-fed babies will gain at a slightly faster rate because formula has more calories than breast milk, and parents tend to push baby to finish bottles (as opposed to letting them stop at the breast whenever they want). If youre not sure whether your little one is getting enough milk, heres a good gauge: If your baby is eating enough, shell produce eight to 10 wet diapers a day, and at least five poopy ones if shes breastfed (fewer for formula-fed newborns).Many babies go through a growth spurt at 7 to 10 days old, and then again at 3 weeks and 6 weeks of age. Dont be surprised if your little glutton demands extra feedings around those times, or nurses for longer sessions. (Its a good thing that breastfeeding is all about supply and demand; the more baby nurses, the more milk Mommy makes!). Baby's weight might shoot up during these periods, and increase more slowly in between growth spurts.How to Manage Too Much Weight Loss or Weight Gain in Your BabyIf your baby is consistently gaining much less than the recommended 6 ounces a week, youll need to do some troubleshooting to find out whats holding back her weight gain and how to fix the problem. Some common issues include:Youre not feeding her often enough. To optimize weight gain, try increasing feedings to eight to 10 times per 24 hours and never go more than three hours during the day or four hours at night between feedings.Your babys not draining at least one breast in each feeding, getting the highest-fat hindmilk that comes at the end. Make sure she finished one breast, feeding for 10 to 15 minutes, before offering the second.Shes not eating effectively because of a tongue or lip tie, hasnt learned how to coordinate her jaw muscles, or gets tired or frustrated trying to eat. In this case, supplementing with bottles of pumped breast milk or formula might help her gain weight. Working with a lactation consultant could help resolve some of these problems too.Your baby is sucking a pacifier or drinking supplementary water. Getting her sucking satisfaction from something other than drinking milk could mean she might not be eating as much as she should. Put aside the pacifier or water for now if that's the case.Youre not producing as much milk as you could be because youre sleeping on your stomach (which puts pressure on your breasts), youve returned to work, youre expending a lot of energy, or your baby is sleeping through the night. Milk is produced on a supply-and-demand basis, and it takes a lot of energy! Increase your feeding or pumping sessions during the day and night if you're able to, make sure youre eating enough calories and drinking plenty of water, and try to take it easy.What if your baby is packing on the pounds faster than 8 ounces a week? If that just happens over the course of one week, you might be in the middle of a growth spurt. And some newborns simply grow faster than others. If your baby is exclusively breastfed, it's unlikely that you're overfeeding her, and the extra weight gain is probably just a sign of her growing appetite. If youre supplementing with bottles, or feeding exclusively formula, make sure you know the signs that your baby is full so youre not forcing her to eat when shes already satisfied. A full baby will usually:Close her lipsStop suckingSpit the nipple outTurn her head awayWhen to Call the DoctorIf your baby has the recommended number of wet and poopy diapers a day, seems alert after she wakes up from sleeping, and is latching onto a breast or bottle correctly, then theres no need to obsess about the scale. Babies all grow at different rates, and the newborn whos slow to grow will likely catch up to her peers later, just like the one who's packing on the pounds at an impressive clip will probably level off in time. But a call the doctor is warranted if you notice any of the following:Your baby hasnt regained her birth weight by the time shes 2 weeks oldShe has a dramatic drop in weight after shes already back to her birth weightShe seems listless or unresponsive even when she wakes up after a napShes not latching onto a breast or bottle at allShe's gaining too much weight for her length or shows other signs of overeatingAs always, if you have any concerns at all about your newborn's weight, check in with your pediatrician. Chances are all those ups and downs are part of your baby's normal growing patterns and will stabilize in time.Updated 1/10/173 Things to Read Next:Baby Growth SpurtsPredicting Baby Height Like a ProUnderstanding Infant Growth Charts"

Slowing Down a Spitter,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ask-heidi/month-4/slowing-down-a-spitter.aspx,"I, too, had a prodigious spitter (I remember that telltale aroma like it was yesterday!).But something you might want to keep in mind  babies seem to spit up more than they really do, at least in terms of quantity, if not frequency. Though it often looks as though they've lost their lunch, literally, it's typically just a few sips, mixed up with saliva and mucus (ick!)  so it looks like a lot more. If your baby's growing well, peeing and pooping plenty, and thriving, there's no need to worry. Most babies stop spitting up so much when they start spending more time consistently in an upright position (lying down or reclining after a meal or being jostled a lot can bring up the works), and that usually happens around six months. The introduction of solids will also make a difference (a liquid diet is easier to spit), but don't start until she's developmentally ready and do check with your doctor first (most doctors recommend starting solids between four and six months). Meanwhile, keep your baby upright as much as possible after meals, and always check with your doctor when you switch formulas (if you haven't already). Also call your pediatrician if you have any other reason to be concerned about your baby's spitting (when in doubt, always ask!).Good luck,"
This Heart-Stopping Story Proves All New Parents Should Learn Infant CPR,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/heart-stopping-story-proves-all-new-parents-should-learn-infant-CPR/,"You probably never expect to have to perform CPR on an infant. Eleven-year-old Alise Fabregas never thought shed have to, eitheruntil the unthinkable happened, and she saved her little sisters life.Alise was at the hospital with her mom and newborn sister Miranda, who was only two days old, CBSBoston reports. When Alise and her mom realized that Miranda was choking on her formula, they were terrified. But Elise remembered the CPR training that she had recently learned in her sixth grade health class and immediately sprung into rescue mode.I told mom to turn her around at an angle and pat her on the back, that way the spit up can come out, and I also called the nurse, Alise told local reporters.   Chemo & Infection  Learn More About Infection Risk During Strong Chemotherapy.  www.ChemoInfection.com       Alises story is heart-warming and inspiring, but it also serves as a sobering reminder to new parents. Although its scary to think about, choking is a leading cause of death among infants, according to the National Safety Council.Babies have smaller airways that are more easily blocked than adults' and bigger kids', and it takes time for them to get the hang of skills like chewing and swallowing. And of course, its no secret that little ones love to explore their world by putting things in their mouths.In an emergency situation where every second counts, being able to identify when your child is choking and knowing how to perform CPR could save your childs life. That's why it's important to take a course in infant CPR. They're available at many community centers, hospitals, fire departments, ambulance corps, the American Red Cross and American Heart Association. You can also ask your child's doctor for recommendations.Unfamiliar with the signs of choking and infant CPR? Here's a brief primer. But don't forget to sign up for that class!What are the signs of infant choking?According to the National Institutes of Health, these signs include:Trouble breathing, with ribs and chest pulled inward.Inability to cry or make much sound.Weak or ineffective coughing.Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling.Bluish skin color.Loss of consciousness.What should you do if your infant is choking?If your baby is coughing hard or crying loudly, let her try to dislodge the object on her own. If her coughs or cries are weak, you should try to dislodge the object:Lay her face down along your forearm, pointing her head downward, lower than her body.Use the palm of your free hand to give 5 forceful blows between her shoulder blades.If the object doesnt come out, you should:Turn your baby face up, making sure to support her head.Place two fingers in the middle of her breastbone and give 5 quick thrusts down.Give 5 more back blows, followed by 5 more chest thrusts. Continue until the object is dislodged.If your baby loses consciousness, stops breathing, or turns blue, shout for help, tell someone to call 911, and then start infant CPR. If youre alone, shout for help, performCPRfor one minute, then call 911.If your baby is unconscious and you can see the object blocking the airway, remove it with your finger. Then, start infant CPR.Heres how:Carefully place your infant on her back.Perform 30 chest compressions fast and hard, without pausing.Open her airway.Look, listen, and feel for breathing.If your infant isnt breathing, cover her nose and mouth tightly with your mouth. Then, give two rescue breaths.Continue chest compressions and rescue breathing until your baby recovers, or until help arrives.Always call your pediatrician after a child chokes or loses consciousness, even if you successfully removed the object and the child seems fine.And finally, remember: While choking accidents cant always be prevented, you can take steps to help your baby stay safe. Keep your infant away from small objects, including small foods or toys. Always watch your infant while shes eating, and make sure she isnt crawling while she eats."
"Gerber Formula - Thanks, But No Thanks",http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/strollersandstilettosonemothersbalancingact/gerber-formula-thanks-but-no-thanks,"A couple weeks ago, when I got my first Gerber formula check in the mail, I must admit, I was terribly excited. I'd never actually heard of Gerber formula before, but hey, it was Gerber. And no one makes baby food like Gerber, right? And it was a substantial formula check. I actually had to read the Gerber formula check a couple times to make sure I was reading it correctly. Could it be true? With this baby food formula check I could get a tub of Gerber formula for virtually free??? No way! And since I hadn't seen a Similac baby food formula check in several months now, I was terribly intrigued at the thought of getting a tub of Gerber formula for free... Free is a great thing... And it's Gerber formula... so I instantly trusted it, on name alone. And I'm sure Baby G wouldn't mind switching up her baby food formula a little bit, especially if the entire tub is free. Baby G likes free things. And at seven months old, and demonstrating absolutely no signs of any formula intolerance or problems with standard Similac baby food formula, I'm sure she wouldn't have a problem with the Gerber formula. So off to the store we went, Gerber formula check in hand, to get our free tub of Gerber baby food formula. I was thrilled when I checked out. Gerber had just won me over!When I got home, I had second thoughts about the starting Baby G on the Gerber formula. It smelled different, and in my opinion, not in a good way. The Similac formula had a certain neutral scent to it, but the Gerber formula had more of an odor to it. I figured the difference in smells between the baby food formula brands accounted for the fact they were different products, with different makeups, and therefore would probably smell different. And when I fed Baby G her first bottle of Gerber formula, she didn't seem to notice the difference, and she sucked it down the way she had the Similac baby food formula.But then the baby stink set in. My once sweet smelling baby suddenly had incredibly stinking baby poop. She had stinky baby gas. She was just an overall stinky baby... And it wasn't just during diaper changes. Baby G suddenly developed this ever present baby stinky odor to her. Taking into account the fact there had been no other changes to Baby G's diet or environment, the only logical culprit was the Gerber formula. That was disappointing. And despite the fact I gave Baby G ample time to get used to the new baby food formula, the stinky baby poop never went away. The Gerber formula was a fail. We couldn't keep using it, no matter how cheap it was... We went back to Similac and all our odor problems instantly cleared up...  Crohn's Disease Patient - Real Patients. Real Stories. Hear From Patients and Learn About Their Experience.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Patient-Stories   Abandoning the Gerber formula was an easy, albeit slightly disappointing decision, especially when the next round of Gerber formula checks arrived in the mail, without a Similac check to be found... But Gerber formula just isn't the right formula for us. So we'll be giving the formula checks away."

Milk for Toddlers: Which Kind is Right,http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-nutrition/milk-for-toddlers.aspx,"If youre ready to ditch the breast pump or pricey formula, youre right on schedule. Twelve months is the legal drinking age  for cows milk, that is. So now that your child has turned one (hooray!), hes ready for the big switch. But the question is, which kind of milk for toddlers should you choose?The gospel used to be that one-year-olds should get whole milk because the fat it contains was considered essential for proper brain and nervous-system development. Two-year-olds  whose bodies are more developed and no longer need the extra fat  were supposed to move on to two percent or one percent milk. But times, they are a changin. These days, theres so much concern about childhood weight and rising cholesterol levels (yes, even in toddlers) that experts have a new message regarding milk for toddlers.The updated thinking is that because kids get plenty of saturated fat from other sources, milk fat isnt as important as we once believed. In fact, research shows that toddlers who drink lower-fat milk develop just fine. So, with that in mind, heres the new master plan on milk for toddlers.Start your one-year-old on whole milk if:Hes at a healthy weight  meaning hes below the 85th percentile on the body mass index (BMI) charts.You have no family history of obesity, high cholesterol, or heart disease.Start your one-year-old on reduced-fat milk if:His body mass index is above the 95th percentile.Heart disease and high cholesterol run dangerously through the branches of your family tree.What to do at two? Ask your pediatrician whether your two-year-old should keep chugging reduced-fat milk or switch to one percent.What if your toddler doesnt like milk?If your child doesnt have a taste for milk, you may have to resort to some sneaky tactics to help him get used to it. Here are some tricks to try:Try mixing milk with breast milk or formula. Then gradually increase the milk into the mix, until all youve got is milk, straight up.Experiment with different temperatures  your little rebel may take to milk better if its warm as opposed to cold.Toss some milk in a blender with your childs favorite fruit to change the flavor, color, and texture. Giving your toddler a princess pink drink or a true blue brew could make all the difference. Another bonus to this plan is that youll kick up the fiber and vitamin content.Of course, if your independent-minded tot is determined to reject milk, dont fret. And dont force. Assuming hes getting healthy fats from other sources, youll just need to make sure he also gets vitamin D from a multivitamin and calcium from other foods, like dairy or calcium-fortified breads, orange juice, and cereals. And one day soon, hell realize the fun of slurping up some milk with that cereal!Updated 3/7/143 Things to Read Next:Calcium for Toddlers: 7 Surprising SourcesThe Scoop on Soy Milk for ChildrenToddler Eating Basics"
BLOG: Compare Infant Formula Carefully,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/astudentatmamauniversity/comapre-infant-formula-carefully,"About a month ago, I set out on a crusade to compare infant formula varieties in hopes of finding one that agreed with Miss Frankette's guts. After much discomfort and many different cans of formula lining our cupboard, we've finally settled on the best baby formula for Miss Frankette. At least for right now.It's been a tough job to compare infant formula. I decided that I wanted to be as empirical as possible, so I tried to compare infant formula in regards to four categories of how it affected my baby: gassiness, fussiness, spitting up and pooping. Always some kind of data to collect, eh? Can't keep a good scientist down. Here's how the various formulas shook out for us.Similac Advance: high marks for pooping (nice and loose) and spitting up (low to moderate), but low marks for gassiness and fussiness. This was actually the formula where we started out, until extreme gassiness drove us on the search for the best baby formula.Nestle GoodStart: high marks for pooping, low marks for gassiness and fussiness, and abysmal marks for spitting up. It was really quite epic, the spewing that happened while Miss Frankette was on this formula. I hadn't realized that a formula could make THAT much difference in the spitting up department, but oh baby. I probably used a whole bottle of stain remover on the little missy's clothes during the week we tried this formula. And it didn't even solve our gassy/fussy problem! Boo.Soy formula: I figured perhaps Miss Frankette was having a problem with the cow's milk protein, so maybe soy would be better. Nope. It was worse. Low marks for pooping (she was nearly constipated), terrible marks for gassiness and fussiness, and abysmal marks for spitting up. The soy formula agreed with this poor baby least. I probably only used an eighth of the can before we had to try a new formula. Honestly, I wasn't too sad to leave soy formula behind. I've wondered about some of the allegations that the phytoestrogens in soy formula can interfere with a baby's hormonal development. I haven't read any firm scientific evidence supporting that, but it still made me a little curious.Enfamil Gentlease: high marks for pooping, low marks for gassiness/fussiness, and abysmal marks for spitting up. There must be something about the formulas that have the partially broken down proteins (like the Goodstart and this one) that just does not agree with Miss Frankette AT ALL. She spits them up so badly that I wonder if she's keeping any down at all. Not good, friends. Not good.Similac Sensitive: This formula is specifically lactose-free, for babies who are lactose sensitive. I don't know for sure if that's the case with Miss Frankette, but this formula seems to work best for her for whatever reason. She still has a little gassiness, fussiness and spitting up, but what baby doesn't? Overall it's the best baby formula we've tried. The funny thing is that we tried this one in the beginning of our quest to compare infant formula, but since it didn't completely alleviate the symptoms, I kept searching. I guess we had to find out how much WORSE she was on the other formulas before I realized that this one was pretty good!What has mama learned from all this? Well, for one thing, I have to compare infant formula very carefully for each baby. J-man did wonderfully on soy formula, so I was fully expecting Miss Frankette to do the same. Nope. I also discovered that formula-hopping itself creates symptoms (like gassiness, fussiness and constipation) that can muddy the waters of comparison. That's probably why our pediatrician recommended at least a week on each formula. That's usually long enough to get a good idea of how the formula is actually behaving in baby's system, minus the symptoms of the formula switch itself. [Although in some cases, like the soy formula for example, we just couldn't wait out a whole week. Mama couldn't watch her baby suffer for that long!]So, I think we'll stop formula-hopping for a while. Miss Frankette is obviously growing well and hopefully experiencing a minimum of discomfort in her guts. Who knows, maybe the gassiness and fussiness will decrease even more now that we're not switching formulas every week! Here's hoping."
Look Beyond Baby Formula Reviews to Find the Best Formula for Your Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/baby/look-beyond-baby-formula-reviews-to-find-the-best-formula-for-your-baby.aspx,"Here's the thing about babies: just like adults, they're all different. So when it comes to choosing a formula for your baby, it's important to remember that what works well for one child might not be the best option for your baby. While baby formula reviews can be a great resource for finding out information from other moms, they're not the only piece of information you need to look at when choosing the best formula for your baby. Here are three steps to help you find the best formula for your child.Start with a basic formula. If you're planning on formula feeding from the start, the hospital will often supply you  but they probably won't send you home with any extra! When I had my little man, our hospital offered two name-brand formulas for us to choose from. Assuming that they would send us home with a supply for at least a day or two, I didn't stock up prior to giving birth. That was a big mistake, which resulted in a stop at the grocery store on our way home from the hospital. Not an ideal way to start parenthood, let me tell you!Watch for signs of fussiness.This is a great way to find out whether or not your little one has a sensitive tummy. When we were in the hospital, my little guy did alright on the regular formula  but after a couple of days he seemed gassy, which made him a little crabby. We tried a formula that was a little lighter on the bubbles and a little gentler on his belly, and he really started to thrive on it. At that point we realized we had found the right formula for his tummy, which is something we never would have been able to figure out by simply reading baby formula reviews.Cost is always a factor. It doesn't matter if you're an average Joe or a multimillionaire  if you can save money on a product, you're going to. Here's the thing with generic baby formula: it's exactly the same as its name brand counterparts. Look on the labels for what brand and type of formula the generic one compares to. Hold the ingredients and nutritional information side by side and compare. They're pretty much exactly the same, but the generic is significantly less money! I've found that buying from the big discount stores can save you even more  you'll pay the same price as you will for the generic formula at the grocery store, but get a can that's quite a bit bigger!How did you decide what formula to buy for your baby?

He weighed only 5 kg, or 11 lbs, the same as an average 3 month-old.The boy, living in Milan with his mom and dad, was not given any dietary supplements, which lowered his calcium levels to ""the minimum needed to survive,"" Italian paper The Local reports, and aggravated a heart condition (not caused by his diet) to the point that he required emergency surgery. He's recovering well.Following the surgery, hospital staff reported his condition to social services because they said his parents refused to give him a more complete diet even after doctors asked them to. A local court has placed him in the custody of the hospital until the investigation of his parents is complete.  Crohn's Disease Treatment - FDA-Approved Treatment Option Discuss Crohn's Treatment Options with Your Doctor. See What's Possible Today.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Discuss-Crohns   If you and your toddler are vegetarian or vegan, this story probably pisses you off  and rightfully so. To some, these parents, along with several similar ones, will give meat- and meat-product-free families a bad rap.But the truth is plenty of parents raise healthy children with alternative diets because they take care to still meet all of their baby's nutritional needs. No one knows for sure what drove the parents of this little boy to make their dietary choices or exactly what they were feeding him, but it's clear they were not following guidelines and compromised his wellbeing as a result.""It is not a problem to choose different or unusual kinds of nutrition, and we certainly do not want to enter into a discussion of the merits of the decision,"" said Luca Bernardo, the hospital's pediatric director. ""But since birth, the baby should have had support in this case with calcium and iron.""So what are the recommendations for raising a child on a vegan diet?First, as long as his or her eating patterns are well-planned, know that veganism and vegetarianism are ""perfectly healthy for infants and toddlers,"" according to the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Just follow medical recommendations and consult with your pediatrician along the way.Next, doctors still recommend breast milk as the main (or only) source of nutrition for the first 6 months of baby's life. If you do not breastfeed, opt for iron-fortified formula, which comes in soy if you're vegan.When baby is 4 to 6 months or older, you can introduce solids in pretty much the same way you would for a non-vegan or -vegetarian child. Try tofu or beans instead of meat and soy yogurt and cheese.If you're vegan, you may want to consider breastfeeding for more than a year (the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization). Wean with soy-milk formula fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Don't use milk alternatives (soy, rice, almond) during baby's first year.The most important part of feeding your baby or toddler a vegan or vegetarian diet, which can have serious health consequences if ignored, is getting your children enough of the nutrients that normally come from meat and dairy. These are: Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Protein and Fiber.Although this story is heartbreaking and even infuriating to some, these parents do not represent all vegan or vegetarian parents or this lifestyle. Feed your child however you feel is best; just don't confuse your beliefs with their needs."

Folic Acid During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/folic-acid-during-pregnancy/,"By now youve likely read all about the importance of taking your prenatal vitamin every day. One of the most important reasons: for the folic acid it contains. Known as folate in food form, this crucial nutrient, a B vitamin (specifically B9) is essential for your body when it comes to your baby's growth and development, particularly in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.Why Do I Need to Take Folic Acid During Pregnancy?Theres no doubt your body works overtime when youre expecting and it cant make a baby all on its own. It requires plenty of nutrients to baby-build, folic acid being one of the most important of all. Folic acid helps the body break down, use and create protein, the building block of our cells. It also plays a role in DNA creation and the formation of red blood cells. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, folic acid helps the embryonic neural tube the precursor to babys brain and spinal cord to properly close. It also assists in the formation of babys heart and circulatory system.Because folic acid is water-soluble, your body does not store excess. Instead, it gets passed through your urine. Thats why you absolutely must regularly incorporate this vitamin into your diet.ADVERTISINGWhat are the Benefits of Folic Acid?Loads of research has shown that folic acid, especially if its started in the months preceding pregnancy, has important benefits for expecting women and their babies. These include reducing the risk of:Miscarriage; research has shown that some women have trouble getting or staying pregnant because of folic acid deficiencyNeural tube defects, including spina bifida and anencephaly, by up to 70 percentCongenital heart defectsGestational diabetesPreterm laborAutism in your babyHow Much Folic Acid Do I Need During Pregnancy?Experts at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) all recommend pregnant women consume at least 400 mcg of folic acid every day, ideally beginning at least one month before you start trying to conceive, and ideally 600 mcg a day from all sources, including foods and prenatal vitamins.What Are the Sources of Folic Acid?All prenatal vitamins should contain at least 400 mg of folic acid. Consider it your nutrient backup during pregnancy; it comes in handy especially on days when you feel too sick to eat. So aim to take yours every single day.That said, a supplement simply cant replace a healthy diet. Its vital to eat plenty of folate-rich foods when youre expecting, since theyre also a good source of many other important baby-making nutrients fiber, calcium and vitamins A and C, to name a few. Some of the best sources of folate in your diet include:Dark leafy greens: 263 mcg in 1 cup cooked spinachAvocado: 120 mcg in 1 cup slicedLegumes: 250 to 350 mcg in 1 cup beans, lentils or peasBroccoli: 168 mcg in 1 cup chopped and cookedAsparagus: 134 mcg in 1/2 cupBeets: 80 mcg in two smallOrange: 35 mcg in 3/4 cupFoods fortified with folic acid, including whole grain cereal, bread, pasta and riceRELATED: 8 Folate-Rich Foods and How to Eat Them!Should I Keep Taking Folic Acid After Baby Is Born?If youre breastfeeding, experts recommend taking a basic daily womens multivitamin that contains 100 percent of the recommended daily value of all nutrients, including folic acid, to support your nutritional needs. You can also choose to continue taking your prenatal vitamin, or you can take a vitamin supplement designed for breastfeeding moms.Updated 1/20/173 Things to Read Next20 Common Pregnancy SymptomsHalf of Breastfeeding Moms Not Giving Babies Important Vitamin D SupplementNoninvasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT)"
Eating Vegetarian and Vegan During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-vegetarian-vegan-during-pregnancy/,"Got a beef with beef (or chicken, fish, eggs ordairy)? There is no reason to worry. You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet even now that youre expecting. Here is what you should know to make sure you and your baby are still getting everything you need.Can I still follow a vegetarian or vegan diet when I'm pregnant?Don't be surprised if you come across well-meaningnaysayers; there are still so many misconceptions about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy. In truth, vegetarians and vegans have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies. Why is there any concern at all? Some of the most vital baby-boosting nutrients are more easily found in meats and other animal-based products. In good news, it's still a cinch to getthem elsewhere.What nutrients will I need to be extra careful to get when I'm pregnant and vegan or vegetarian?Protein, calcium, iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D are all nutrients to be mindful of when you're expecting and adhering to your vegetarian or vegan diet.PROTEINWhy: Expecting women need more protein than ever that's because this essential nutrient helps build cells and make hormones for your growing baby. If youre a dairy- and egg-eating vegetarian, you may already get what you need from potent protein sources (craving moreomelets and Greek yogurt now that you're pregnant?). If you're worried you're not getting enough or are a vegan, there are veggie-based proteins that you can add into your diet. How Much: 75 grams per dayFoods to Eat: Legumes, whole grains, soy and nuts and seedsSplit or green peasChickpeasBlack, navy, kidney or pinto beansQuinoaBulgar, buckwheat and whole wheat couscousOatmealWhole-wheat pastaWhole-grain cereals and breadsNut buttersWalnuts, cashews, pistachios, almonds, Brazil nuts and pine nutsSoy milkTofuMisoCALCIUMWhy:Calcium is keyfor building your babys bones, muscles, heart and nerves, especially during the third trimester. In fact, it's so essential to his development that what he doesn't get from what you eat, he'll take from your bones, potentially putting you at risk of osteoporosis later in life. Luckily, dairy products aren't the onlyoptionsfor getting your daily recommended amounts. Your practitioner may also suggest that you add a calcium supplement for extra insurance.How Much:1,000 mg per dayFoods to Eat:YogurtMilkCheeseGreen leafy vegetablesSoy milkTofuCalcium-fortified orange juiceIRONWhy: Your blood volume increases by nearly 50 percent during pregnancy to support you and your developing baby  and iron is required to produce more red blood cells. Not getting enough? Low iron can result in anemia, which, left untreated, may also lead topreterm labor and low birth weight. Vegetarians and vegans aren't alone in needing to be conscious of iron levels during pregnancy. Even red-meat eaters have a hard time getting enough from their diets while expecting. One simple way to get what you need is to take an iron supplement, which your practitioner may recommend in addition to your prenatal vitamin after week 20 (or earlier, if routine testing shows your iron stores are low). Its a good idea to also chow down on iron-rich foods.How Much: About 27 mgFoods to Eat:BeansEdamameSoy productsOat branBarleyQuinoaBulgurPumpkin seedsDried fruitSpinach, collard greens or kaleSeaweedVITAMIN B12Why: Vitamin B12 partners with folic acid to help with proper fetal brain development; its also important for the formation of red blood cells and for building genetic material. A deficiency has been linked to neural tube defects as well as increased risk of preterm labor. Though B12 deficiencies are rare, vegetarians and particularly vegans often dont get enough of this vitamin, since its found only in foods that come from animals. Ask your practitioner if you need more than what's provided in your prenatal vitamin; she can recommend a supplemental B12 as well as folic acid and ensure you're not getting too much of a good thing.How Much: 2.6 mcgper dayFoods to Eat: Vitamin B12-fortified soy milkFortified cerealsNutritional yeastFortified meat substitutesVITAMIN DWhy: This vital vitamin plays a role in building and maintaining healthy teeth and bones. Severe deficiency has been linked to complications including congenital rickets (a condition that causes the bones to become soft and weak, leading to poor growth and skeletal deformities) as well as bone fractures in newborns. The best dietary sources of vitamin D are milk and fish. If neither are part of your diet, a few minutes of sun each day helps your body produce vitamin D  though that can be tough, especially if you have darker skin, live in less-sunny climates, dont get outdoors a lot or wear sunscreen. You can get some vitamin D from fortified soy milk, breads, cereals and OJ, but usually not nearly enough. Fortunately, you can get what you need from a supplement. So ask your practitioner about testing your vitamin D levels and prescribing a supplement as needed.RELATED: 11 Best Foods to Eat While PregnantHow will a vegetarian or vegan diet effect my baby, and how will I know theres a problem?Theres every reason you can have a healthy pregnancy and baby, as long as you:Eat a well-balanced pregnancy diet, focusing on the above nutrientsTake your prenatal vitamin every dayVisit your doctor for all of your regular prenatal appointments, and dont hesitate to share any symptoms that concern you. Your doctor will monitor you for any potential issues and ensure youre not deficient in the nutrients you needWhat if I crave meat while Im pregnant?Given all those changes in hormones, lots of expecting moms find that their tastes in foods change somewhat or even a lot in pregnancy. And most pregnant women have food cravings, often for meat. If you feel okay about making an exception for meat during pregnancy, thats perfectly fine; you can get back to being vegetarian or vegan if you want after babys arrival. You may also want to consider just adding fish, eggs and dairy to your diet, if you dont eat them already; again, its not necessary. Otherwise, focus on eating your favorite protein-packed meat substitutes, which may help calm cravings.Can I stay vegetarian or vegan while Im breastfeeding?You can stick to your vegetarian or vegan diet if youre breastfeeding. However if your diet might be lacking some important vitamins and minerals (B12, zinc or calcium, if youre vegetarian or vegan)  and especially if your baby has health problems or was born prematurely  your doctor might recommend additional supplements for your baby. If you decide to feed your baby a vegetarian or vegan diet once he starts solids, be extra careful to ensure hes getting all the nutrients he needs.Updated 1/27/17"
That Article Saying Prenatal Vitamins Are Unnecessary Is a Total Scam,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0713/that-article-saying-prenatal-vitamins-are-harmful-is-a-total-scam,"By now youve probably seen the British article questioning whether prenatal vitamins are really necessary with some media even insinuating the supplements are a scam (ahem, New YorkMagazine).Dont listen. To be clear, this paper is just a review, not a study. In other words, its an opinion piece. And the advice it offers, experts say, can be potentially dangerous.As medical practitioners will tell you, there are a number of nutrients women need during pregnancy, and Americans are deficient in many of them. Not getting enough while youre expecting can have devastating effects for both mom and baby.    Save Up to $3.00 on Alive! Multivitamins   I dont agree that prenatals are a thing of past, says Scott Sullivan, MD, the director of maternal-fetal medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). We have good data on a lot of these nutrients, so its premature to say we should just abandon prenatal vitamins.The review, published in the journalDrug and Therapeutics Bulletin, looked at past research to determine whether taking folic acid, iron, and vitamins A, C, D and E during pregnancy reduced the risks of complications including preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight or stillbirth.READ ALSO: Choosing the Best Prenatal VitaminThe authors concluded that British women only need to take two supplements: 400 mcg of folic acid (before and up through 12 weeks of pregnancy), and vitamin D (which they said appeared to beneficial, though not as clear cut as folic acid). They added that much evidence for taking supplementation in pregnancy comes from studies done in low-income countries,where women are more likely to be malnourished.But there are several other nutrients ACOG recommends in a supplement for good reason. Here's the truth behind prenatal vitaims and exactly why you and your baby need them.Calcium: ACOG recommends all women, not just pregnant women, get at least 1000 mg of calcium of day. But calcium is especially important during pregnancy, since what you consume helps build babys teeth and skeleton. If youre not getting enough in your diet, baby will take it from your bones one reason why women whove been pregnant are at higher risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis.Vitamin D, in turn, works with calcium to help support the demands of pregnancy. Without enough, your body cant process the calcium you need.Iron: Anemia is very common in pregnancy, Sullivan notes. ""Thirty to 40 percent of my patients are iron deficient, he says. Being anemic can make you feel even more sick than pregnancy already does, plus put you at risk of a blood transfusion during delivery and complications in future pregnancies. Its very hard to be sure youre getting enough, which is why ACOG recommends supplementing, Sullivan says.READ ALSO: Your Prenatal Diet: An InfographicIodine: A quarter of American women are deficient in iodine, says Sullivan, because people are eating less table salt and seafood, the nutrients two major sources. If you dont get enough iodine when youre expecting, it puts baby at risk for neurodevelopmental issues. Most women need a supplement of about 120 to 150 mcg. About half of all American prenatals currently contain iodine, Sullivan says, but all will in about two years.Two more nutrients that are wise to get from your prenatalarevitamin B6 (which can help curb morning sickness) and omega 3 (which helps build babys brain).Because there are so many of these recommended nutrients, a prenatal vitamin should be a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than taking a bunch of individual supplements. Sure, there are pricey ones out there, but they're not always the best, and some really good ones are cheap, Sullivan says.Still skeptical? Talk to your doctor about your diet and individual nutritional needs. What you eat is vitally important, and you cant get everything you need from a supplement, either. But your doctor will almost definitely recommend taking one anyway. Ask his or her advice to find the best, most cost-effective option.Some people need B12 supplements, some are people very low in vitamin D, some people have anemia,"" Sullivan says. ""All of which makes supplementing more complex than [the authors] would make it appear."

Nutrients That Make a Baby,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/week-14/spotlight-nutrients.aspx,"With all those cells and no little cell phone in there to place a take-out order, your baby's relying on you to deliver all the vitamins, minerals, and calories he or she needs to grow and develop. Feeling the pressure (in addition to the heartburn)? Lighten up. At 14 weeks pregnant, the good news is that most of the nutrients your baby needs, like vitamin A or protein, are probably already a part of your regular diet. Others may send you scrambling a little  if not to find them, then to find ways to increase their quantity in your diet to baby-making proportions. But all in all, the extraordinary task of nourishing a baby doesn't take extraordinary measures  just good solid nutrition.Certain nutrients deserve the spotlight  not because they are more important than any of the other nutrients in your diet (all nutrients are important in fueling the growth and healthy development of your developing baby), but because these are more likely than others to be lacking in your diet.Folic acid: Your baby's nervous system and spinal cord are among the first things to develop, and folic acid (aka folate), found naturally in whole grains, green leafy vegetables, beans, bananas, broccoli, and milk, and added via fortification to breads and cereals, is essential to neural development. Which is why it's recommended that you eat folic-acid-rich foods and begin taking a supplement containing folic acid even before you become pregnant and that you continue to focus on folate throughout your pregnancy. The recommended amount of folic acid is 400 mcg before pregnancy and 600 mcg once you are pregnant. Make sure your prenatal vitamin contains that amount.Iron: When you're making a baby, you're in the blood-making business big time. Since iron helps generate blood supply, it's a nutrient you'll need plenty of to keep your body's and your baby's supply of red in the black. Ensure your intake of this vital mineral by eating such iron-rich foods as beef, duck, soy products, spinach, potatoes (with the skins on), and dried fruits. Your practitioner will probably also suggest a supplement after week 20 to keep your iron up as blood demand steps up.Calcium: It does a growing baby body good, building strong bones and teeth. But calcium also does your body good, too  helping to maintain solid bone density and prevent osteoporosis later in life, and lowering your risk of preeclampsia now. So make sure you ""got milk"" and other calcium-loaded foods, like fortified juice, almonds, sesame seeds, soy products, green leafies, sardines, canned salmon with bones, and broccoli.Vitamin C: Vitamin C is essential for the production of collagen, which gives strength to your baby's cartilage, muscles, blood vessels, and bones. It also gives his or her body the ability to repair wounded tissue. And if that's not enough, adequate doses of vitamin C have been linked to a healthy birth weight and a decreased risk of premature rupture of the membranes. Since vitamin C can't be stored, you'll need to make sure you get enough servings daily. You can get your C with the old standard  orange juice  as well as from a wide variety of delicious fruits (mango, papaya, cantaloupe, and strawberries) and veggies (including red peppers, broccoli, collard greens, and vegetable juice).Vitamin D: Most of your vitamin D supply comes from the sun or milk. If you don't drink the white stuff or spend much time outdoors, you'll need to find your D from other sources. That's because vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy teeth and bone structure, plus it helps you absorb calcium (and you already know why you need to absorb plenty of that). Get your D from canned sardines, fortified milk and orange juice, and egg yolk. And get a few minutes of sun each day (when weather permits).DHA: Eliminating fat may be the oldest diet strategy in the book, but forget it  you're not trying to lose weight. Plus, your baby needs some fat  especially essential fats (that's why they're called essential), like omega-3 fatty acids. DHA, one of those omega-3s, is a major component of the human brain and retina  and your baby's developing brain and eyes need a healthy dose of DHA each day. Get DHA from such oily fish as trout, anchovies, sardines, or wild salmon, as well as from DHA eggs. (Learn more about good fats during pregnancy).See more tips for eating well while pregnant."

"Obesity in Mom and Dad Linked to Developmental Delays in Baby, Study Finds",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/obesity-in-mom-dad-linked-to-developmental-delays-in-baby/,"While most overweight and obese moms -- those whose weight is 20 percent over whats considered the ideal -- have perfectly healthy pregnancies, carrying extra pounds does increase the risk of a number of pregnancy and birth complications. Now, a new study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that babies of not only moms but also dads who are obese before conception (i.e. a BMI of 30 or higher) may also be more likely to suffer from a number of developmental delays in the first few years of life.What Did the Research Show?Researchers looked at 4,821 babies and toddlers between 4 months and 3 years old living in New York state between 2008 and 2010. Participating parents provided their height and weight before pregnancy to calculate their body mass indexes (BMIs). They then filled out theAges and Stages Questionnaire when their children were 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months old, a survey that features straightforward questions to screen whether kids are on track for their age developmentally in terms of fine motor, gross motor, communication, personal-social functioning, and problem-solving skills and ability.The authors found that children of obese moms had more difficulty than those of normal-weight parents with fine motor skills, like turning the pages of a book or stacking blocks. Kids of obese dads scored lower in personal-social skills like feeding, playing and dressing. Little ones with extremely obese parents were more likely to fail problem-solving tests. The research took into account other factors that can impact a childs development, including parents education, income, smoking and alcohol use.  Treating Crohn's Disease - FDA Approved Treatment Option Assess Your Symptoms of Crohn's Disease & Learn about a Treatment Option.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Assessment   ""Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers, and our results suggest that Dad's weight also has significant influence on child development,"" lead researcher Edwina Yeung, PhD, told CNN. ""Our study wasn't designed to prove cause and effect. At this point, we only have correlations between parents' BMI and children's scores on a screening questionnaire.""What Does This Mean for Parents?The authors theorize that during pregnancy, a number of factors related to obesity -- including high blood sugar, a lack of nutrients, abnormal development of some hormonal systems and obesity-caused inflammation -- may potentially impact fetal brain development.""Obesity is correlated with a rise in inflammation and in hormones that regulate body fat and metabolism. One theory is that these hormones might influence the development of the baby's brain,"" Yeung said.On the fathers side, obesity might change how the genes in sperm manifest themselves in the developing fetus.What Should Pregnant Women Know About Obesity?Being obese before and during pregnancy -- especially if you dont take steps to live a healthy lifestyle -- has also been linked to a number of complications for Mom and baby, including:Other delayed developmental milestones, including sitting alone and crawlingBrain and heart defects, including neural tube defectsAutism, according to a study published earlier this yearMacrosomia, when a baby grows too large in utero and weighs 8 pounds 13 ounces or more at birth (which can lead to delivery complications)C-section deliveryPreterm birthGestational diabetesPreeclampsiaHypertensionThe extra weight may also spell more backache, varicose veins,swelling,heartburnand other uncomfortable pregnancy side effects for Mom.What This Means for YouExperts stress that this is just one study, and more research is needed to understand the link between BMI and babys development. In the meantime, though, its best to play it safe and work with your partner and your practitioner to live as healthy of a lifestyle as possible. A few tips that can help both you and your partner manage your weights to have a minimum impact on your health and your babys:Know your BMI. Your BMI is a calculation that measures your height against your weight to roughly determine whether youre underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. As you make lifestyle changes, take a regular look at the scale to survey your progress.Focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Skip not only fast food but prepackaged ones as well. Instead, stock your kitchen with lots of fresh or frozen whole veggies, fruits, low-fat protein (chicken, beef, salmon, etc.) and whole grains (whole wheat, oats, quinoa). These foods arent inflammatory -- important since inflammation may be one of the factors impacting fetal brain development -- and packed with the nutrients you and your growing baby need in your pregnancy diet. Plus the fiber in whole grains and veggies as well as the protein and healthy fats in quality meat and dairy will help keep you fuller for longer. Take your prenatal vitamin for extra assurance.Cook at home when you can. It doesnt have to be fancy. But cooking simple meals as often as you can -- a frozen veggie stir fry with brown rice, for example -- makes it easier to control your portions and means you know exactly whats in every bite.Drink lots of water. Its easy to confuse thirst for hunger. And pretty much all sodas and fruit juices are filled with loads of sugar -- which amounts to empty calories that will only make you more hungry. So aim for least 8 cups of water throughout the day, and eat your fruit whole. Bored? Switch things up by adding fresh fruit (oranges, cucumbers, lemon) or mint to a water infuser.Talk to a dietitian. Knowing which foods to eat and in what proportions is essential to keeping your weight in check. A dietitian can offer guidance and hold you accountable -- and give you the tools to get back on track if necessary.Write it down. Keep a food diary; recording exactly what you eat and when gives you a quick look at the big picture and is another good way to make sure you're living up to your nutrition and dietary needs.If youre expecting, an extra couple of tips to keep in mind:Keep track of calories. You need fewer than you think! In the first trimester you dont need any extra; by the third you only need 500 more a day, but depending on your weight and whether you have diabetes, your doctor may want you to eat less.Watch your pregnancy weight gain. How much you need to gain depends on your pre-pregnancy weight. If you were obese, you should aim to gain no more than 15 pounds total, with about a half pound of weight gained each week of the last trimester. Be sure to talk with your doctor; the right amount of weight for you may be more or less. And keep in mind that pregnancy is not the time to try and lose weight.Perhaps most importantly, be kind to yourself. Its natural to slip up. The goal isnt to be perfect; its to do the best you can to stay as healthy as possible. So focus on small goals every day, like starting with cutting out sweetened beverages or fast food, then adding in more of the healthy stuff. Remind yourself that youre doing this for both yourself and your little one -- extra motivation to walk that extra mile."
Leading OB Group Now Recommends Delaying Umbilical Cord Clamping for All Infants,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/this-is-the-best-time-to-clamp-a-newborns-umbilical-cord/,"For the first time, the leading obstetricians' group in the U.S. is advising doctors not to clamp newborns' umbilical cords as soon as they're born because new research shows delayed cord clamping has benefits for most infants.For the past several years, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended delaying clamping the umbilical cord of preterm infants for 30 to 60 seconds after birth because it allows 30 to 40 percent more blood -- and a final rush of nutrients -- to flow from mom to baby. But because docs also thought delayed cord clamping could increase mom's risk of hemorrhage, they did not recommend it for full-term infants, who, research showed, experienced fewer benefits from it than preemies.Now, though, it appears the benefits of delaying cord clamping until 30 to 60 seconds after birth outweigh the risks, even for healthy, full-term babies.  Chronic Crohn's Disease Get Help Managing Your Symptoms. Learn about a Treatment Option. CrohnsTreatment.com/Chronic-Crohns   ""Increased evidence shows that the practice [of delayed cord clamping] has clear health benefits for both preterm and term infants,"" said Maria A. Mascola, MD, the lead author of the Committee Opinion. ""And, in most cases, this does not interfere with early care, including drying and stimulating for the first breath and immediate skin-to-skin contact.""Previous cord clamping recommendationsACOGs last Committee Opinion, released in 2012, highlighted the benefits of delayed cord clamping for preterm infants, including increased red blood cell volume and better circulation, along with lower risk of brain hemorrhage and intestinal disorders.It did not go so far as to recommend the practice for full-term babies, citing a dearth of research. Since then, a number of studies have shown that full-term infants also get a boost from additional placental blood flow in the first few seconds of life.What new research has foundThe new position paper, published in Obstetrics and Gynecology, notes that delayed clamping does not actually increase the risk of maternal hemorrhage during or after birth. And full-term babies whose umbilical cords are clamped 30 to 60 seconds after birth get a bump in their hemoglobin count and are more likely to have better iron stores, which decreases the odds of iron deficiency in the first year. (Iron deficiency has been linked to impaired cognitive, motor and behavioral development.)In addition, research published last year in JAMA Pediatrics found that 4 year-olds whose cords were clamped three minutes after birth were less likely to have delayed motor skills (like grasping an object) than kids whose cords were clamped immediately. Other studies have found newborns whose cords are clamped later also appear to have better regulation in their immune systems.RELATED: Delayed Cord Clamping May Benefit Kids Years LaterWhat you need to knowIf youd like to delay your baby's cord clamping, talk to your doctor. Delayed clamping isn't safe for everyone, and even though these new recommendations suggest clamping at 30 to 60 seconds after birth, your doctor may have his or her own preferences. You want to make sure you're on the same page.Whatever you decide, add it to your birth plan so everyone in the delivery room is aware and on board. You can also ask about umbilical cord milking, or manually pushing blood through the umbilical cord after its been cut, if delaying clamping isn't safe for you or your baby.When making your decision, you should also be aware that delayed cord clamping slightly increases baby's risk of jaundice. If you delay your baby's cord clamping, keep an eye out for symptoms, like yellowing skin and eyes, and call your doctor if they come up.And last, if youre considering public or private cord blood banking, keep in mind that delayed clamping might prevent you from meet banking or donation criteria. So weigh the benefits of delayed clamping versus cord blood banking with your doctor."
What You Eat Now Might Impact How Long You Breastfeed Later,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0302/what-you-eat-now-might-impact-breastfeeding-duration,"You already know that eating a balanced diet is one of the best steps you can take every day to have a healthy pregnancy. Choosing nutrient-rich foods like fruits, veggies, whole grains, lowfat dairy, nuts, seeds and lean protein nourish both you and your baby. But new research looks more specifically at why certain foods help and possibly harm the body by exploring how dietary inflammation impacts pregnancy outcomes like birth weight and breastfeeding duration.Whats dietary inflammation anyway?Inflammation happens when the bodys immune system reacts to what it considers a foreign object in the body. That can be a good thing sometimes: For example, when you scrape your knee, the redness around the cut is your immune system working to protect you from infection-causing foreign bacteria.Dietary inflammation, on the other hand, is not so good for you. It happens when certain foods cause the immune system to work overtime. While we know that chronic dietary inflammation has been linked to health conditions including heart disease, arthritis, cancer and dementia, researchers have only recently looked at its impact on expectant moms and their babies.  Managing Crohn's Symptoms Learn Keys to Finding Appropriate Treatment for You. Get Info. www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Management   What the study foundIn a new study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital (BWH) in Boston followed 1,808 mom-child pairs to see how diet impacts the health of both mom and baby. Women in their first and second trimesters filled out food questionnaires that were compared to a dietary inflammation index. Researchers then looked for known markers of inflammation in the body by testing women for certain proteins that the liver produces when inflammation is present.The study found that obese women with signs of inflammation in the body were more likely to have low birth weight babies. And lean women with signs of inflammation were more likely to have difficulty breastfeeding, which led them to stop after just a month. In this study, diet was not associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, C-section births or preterm births.According to Sarbattama Sen, M.D., study author and a neonatologist in BWHs Department of Pediatric Newborn Medicine, some animal studies have shown that diet may actually impact breast milk production, but were far from proving this to be true in humans. In other words, weve only just begun to look at the role of inflammation on pregnancy health, and more investigation needs to be done.Study caveatsLean women may have had more difficulty breastfeeding than overweight and obese women in this study because they were more likely to initiate breastfeeding in the first place. Additionally, Dr. Sen contends that inflammation may not have been associated with other adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia because researchers tested women in the second trimester, before the conditions were present in the body. Lastly, because women were asked to self-report their diets, they may have under- or over-reported certain foods.What this means to youWeve got a long way to go before we know the true impact of dietary inflammation on pregnancy health. Fortunately, foods that fight inflammation, like fish, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, also happen to be part of a healthy diet  which reinforces the importance of eating the foods weve long known are good for mom and baby.Here are other helpful tips to a healthy pregnancy diet:Think lean. Protein is essential to building a baby, so choose lean options like chicken, fish, dairy, tofu and legumes.Get your vitamin C. Vitamin C rich foods like kiwi, mango, strawberries and citrus fruits help boost your babys growth and development.Keep it varied. Eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables is key to stocking up on important nutrients like vitamin E, riboflavin, folic acid, magnesium and beta-carotene, which are crucial to babys growth.Go whole. Whole grains found in breads, cereals and pasta are essential to babys development  plus they fight constipation and nausea.Get ample iron. Iron is so important to babys brain development, so ensure youre getting enough red meat, green leafy veggies, lentils, dried fruit and blackstrap molasses.Dont skimp on the healthy fats. Healthy fats found in avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil and fatty fish are essential to brain and eye development.Got milk? Calcium-rich foods like dairy (or dairy alternatives), calcium-fortified juices and green leafy vegetables help with babys bone growth. It also helps keep your bones strong  since if youre not getting enough in your diet, your body will take what it needs for baby from your own bones.3 things to read next:Pregnancy Nutrition 101: An InfographicThe Cost of Feeding a Family of Four a Healthy DietGestational Diabetes Diet Regulations and Menu Plan"
"Colds in Toddlers: Causes, Symptoms, Tips and Remedies",http://www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/health-and-safety/colds-in-toddlers/,"The common childrens cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract that usually lasts a week or two. Most toddlers catch between eight and 10 colds in the first two years of their lives because their still-developing immune systems arent yet equipped to fight them off. If your little one is in day care, he may get sick even more often, since hes exposed to even more germs. The good news: Most colds go away on their own  and getting sick often builds up your toddlers system in the long run, helping him to fend off the next bug that comes his way.What Causes Toddler ColdsToddler colds are caused by more than 200 varieties of contagious viruses that can live in the air we breathe or on surfaces we touch. That means that if someone with a cold breathes on your child or sneezes on him, or if your child picks up something that an infected person has touched, hell likely get exposed to the cold virus and may come down with cold symptoms.Toddler Cold SymptomsMost toddler cold symptoms tend not to be severe. They can include:Runny nose (discharge is watery at first, then becomes thicker and opaque and sometimes yellowish or greenish)Congestion or stuffinessSneezingSore or scratchy throat (which can be difficult to spot in a toddler)HeadacheMild feverLoss of appetiteFatigue and crankinessDry coughHow Long Do Toddler Colds Last?The common cold usually lasts seven to 10 days in toddlers, with day three usually being the worst. A residual nighttime cough, which may not appear until the end of the cold, may last longer.Cold Relief for Toddlers by AgeWhat to Give a 1-Year-Old for a ColdSince toddlers this young dont know how to blow their noses, you can put saline nasal drops in your 1-year-olds nose to loosen clogged mucus. Consider trying a suction bulb to gently extract excess mucus for an extra-stuffy nose. You can also raise the head of your toddlers crib by putting a couple of pillows underneath the mattress.What to Give a 2-Year-Old for a ColdKeep the tissues handy and teach your toddler to blow his nose. Saline nasal drops can also help loosen up crusty mucus that may be clogging his nostrils. If hes sleeping in a big-kid bed, offer him extra pillows to keep his head raised. Otherwise, prop up the crib mattress as described above.What to Give Kids Ages 3 and Up for a ColdExperts strongly advise parents never to offer over-the-counter cough and cold medications to toddlers under the age of 2 (according to the Food and Drug Administration) to 3 years old (according to the American Academy of Pediatrics). Studies have shown that these drugs are ineffective and can cause serious side effects in younger children. In fact, the AAP recommends parents always check with their pediatrician first before offering cough or cold medications to children under the age of 6. If your doctor does give you the OK, be sure to use the dosing syringe or cup that comes with the medicine to avoid potentially dangerous dosing errors.What to Give Toddlers of All Ages for a ColdUnfortunately theres no cure for the common cold in toddlers. Antibiotics are made to treat bacterial infections, which means they have no effect at all on the common cold and can actually be harmful if overused, killing the good bacteria in your childs system.Instead, ensure your child is comfortable. Spread moisturizing ointment lightly under the rims of the nostrils and under the nose to help prevent chapping and soreness. Make breathing easier by putting a humidifier in your little ones room so the moist air can help reduce congestion. Opt for a cold-mist one to keep your toddler safe in case he gets too close to it.Theres no need to medicate every fever; a fever simply lets you know the body is waging war against an infection. But since that fever can make your child feel hot and bothered and keep him from sleeping, you may want to put a cool compress on your toddler's head and dress him in light, breathable fabrics. Ask your doctor if he or she recommends acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower the fever both are safe for toddlers.Your little one may not feel like drinking, but do your best to keep him hydrated, since fever can cause kids to lose fluids. Offer water, juice, Pedialyte, popsicles and chicken soup without large chunks of food. (Chicken soup is more than just hydrating, by the way: The blend of nutrients may have an anti-inflammatory effect, which can ease swelling in the upper respiratory tract and relieve soreness in the throat. Plus, the warm broth and its soothing steamy vapors loosen the mucus that causes congestion.) Be sure to offer vitamin C-rich foods and drinks each day. Frequent small meals may be more appealing than three bigger ones.When to Call the DoctorIf your toddler is between the ages of 1 and 3 years old, call your doctor if his temperature reaches 102 degrees F or higher.Also call if your toddler:Is very lethargicHas zero appetiteHas a seizureHas blue lips or fingernailsHas developed greenish-yellow, foul-smelling discharge from the nose or coughingIs wheezingIs breathing more rapidly than usualHas chest discomfortHas a cough thats getting worse or continues during the daytime after other symptoms are goneHas swollen glands in the neckPulls on his ears day or nightHas symptoms that last longer than 10 daysAllergies could be responsible if your toddler seems to have frequent to continuous colds and a chronically runny nose, especially when accompanied by dark under-eye circles. If your child experiences these symptoms, talk to your doctor.How to Prevent Colds in ToddlersThe best way to prevent a cold is to wash your childs hands regularly (especially before eating and after using the bathroom if hes potty-trained) and to teach your toddlerhand-washing basics. Cant get to a sink? Hand-sanitizing gels will do in a pinch. And try to stay away from anyone with a cold if possible. If you have a cold, wash your hands frequently to avoid passing it on.Updated 2/24/17"
Is My Newborn Baby’s Poop Normal?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ask-heidi/newborn-poop/,"Ah, the sweet smell of successful newborn poop! Your newborns bowel movements have the odorous distinction of being right on time  and on texture. And that youre reading his diapers as if theyre tea leaves is a sign your maternal instinct has kicked in: What comes out of your newborn is one of the most important indicators of whats going on inside him.The color, texture, and odor of newborn poop is not only different from what youre used to, but can seem to change  in frequency, hue, and consistency  as often as your post-baby moods. Whats normal for baby poop depends on whether youre breastfeeding or formula feeding. Heres a quick guide to help you go with the (diaper) flow.Newborn poop: The first days What you saw in his hospital nappies  the greenish-black tar-like stuff  is called meconium. This first newborn poop usually appears within about 24 hours of birth. Instead of food, its made up of the stuff your baby collected in his intestines while in utero  old blood cells and skin cells, for instance (good thing the menu out here is more delectable). Thats why it looks so drastically different from all the baby poop yet to come.Two to four days after you meet your bundle of joy, you should notice transitional stools  they tend to be green and less tacky than meconium. This is a sign that your babys intestinal tract is all-systems-go. From that point on, the type of food your baby is eating will determine the scoop on his poop:Breastfed baby poop is normal when...Its mustard yellow, green, or brown. (Think welcome to earth tones!)Its seedy or pasty.It smells sweet(ish!)  not normal bowel-movement odor.It fills his diapers at least five times a day (and for some babies, during or after each feeding). Moms milk digests at a faster rate than formula does.Formula-fed baby poop is normal when...Its yellowish-brown to brown.Its texture ranges from nut-butter to pudding.It smells more like regular poop.It fills the diaper three to four times a day.Once your babys feeding schedule has been established, his special delivery diapers may appear five or more times a day or once every three days. Thats perfectly normal. As long as his stools are soft, he isnt constipated. But you should call your doctor if...Your breastfed baby doesnt poop for more than three days.Your formula-fed baby doesnt poop for more than five days.Stools are hard and pebbly, or much thicker than peanut butter.Stools are thin, watery, or you see mucus in the diaper  this may be diarrhea.You notice his stool is red or black, which could indicate bleeding.You notice his stool is white, which could indicate hes not properly absorbing nutrients.Welcome to the world of baby poop!"
Are You Drinking Enough Water During Pregnancy?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/drink-enough-water/,"Is being pregnant driving you to drink? Well, it should  at least all the way to the water faucet. As a mom-to-be, its essential to be doubly sure that you're drinking enough water. Heres what you need to know about drinking water during pregnancy, from the benefits (preventing hemorrhoids and other pregnancy symptoms), to how much you need (more than before), to how to ensure your water is safe (more important than ever).Water delivers essentials to your fetusEver wonder how all the good stuff in the prenatal vitamins and healthy foods you're faithfully consuming every day are shipped to your fetus? It all starts with water, which helps your body absorb essential nutrients into the cells and transports vitamins, minerals and hormones to the blood cells. It's those nutrient-rich blood cells that reach the placenta and ultimately your baby  all with the help of H2O.Your recommended daily water intake is higher during pregnancyTo that end, youll need more water to keep your system running for two during pregnancy. The Institute of Medicine says pregnant women in temperate climates should aim to drink 12 or 13 glasses (they count a glass as eight ounces) each day, which is slightly more than the amount for non-pregnant women (around 11 glasses each day). Try to space out your sips to keep them coming steadily throughout the day rather than gulping a lot at once, which could leave you feeling uncomfortably full. Since most of us dont drink enough fluids, filling a water bottle or two every morning and keeping it handy all day takes the hassle out of hydration. Be sure to sip before, during and after you work out, or if you find yourself outside on a hot day. Note, too, that if you feel thirsty, its a sign that your body is already on its way to being dehydrated.How can you tell if you're getting enough? If your trips to the bathroom are frequent and your urine is pale or colorless, you're drinking is on track.Water can help prevent UTIs, constipation and hemorrhoidsNow that you're pregnant, you're not just eating and drinking for two  you're also excreting for two (ew, but true). That means you'll have more trash to take out of your system than ever before. Enter water, which dissolves the waste products and helps flush them from the kidneys. Drinking enough water also keeps your urine diluted, which not only keeps things flowing but also keeps UTIs at bay (urine that hangs out too long in your bladder can become a breeding ground for infection-triggering bacteria), as well as bladder infections and kidney infections (which are are types of UTIs).A copious consumption of water also helps immeasurably in the poop department, helping to move solid wastes more speedily down the digestive path. And, since constipation is pretty common in pregnant women  not to mention the fact that constipation pressure can cause hemorrhoids  well...bottoms up! (Couldnt help it!)Water can help with fatigue, headaches, swelling and overheatingIs it crazy-hot in here  or are you pregnant? Its true, the heat is on (high!) when you're expecting. But if you drink water during pregnancy, you can keep the body's cooling system running smoothly  even when your inner thermostat is cranked all the way up  by dispersing excess heat in the form of sweat.An ample flow of fluids also keeps  pregnancy fatigue in check  one of the first symptoms of dehydration is exhaustion  and can keep headaches at bay (another dehydration symptom). It also helps your body get rid of excess sodium among other things, minimizing swelling particularly swollen feet or ankles (your doctor might call it edema).Ensuring your waters safeIts never a bad idea to assess the cleanliness of your drinking water  and thats especially true when youre pregnant. While most of the water you drink likely comes from public water systems and is generally safe todrink, it can be contaminated withhigh levels of chemicals that could harm a fetus, including lead,mercury and arsenic. In addition, there is increasing evidence that BPA (an industrial chemical that mimics estrogen and is found in some plastics) can be problematic when you're expecting. Learn more on how to ensure your water supply is safe to drink when you're pregnant.Water isnt the only way to hydrateWater is the best drink around, but if youre all watered out? There are plenty of other liquids that make the cut: Milk (an 8-ounce glass of skim yields just over seven ounces of water), sparkling or flavored waters, fruit and vegetable juices (watch out for added sugar in fruit juice and added sodium in veggie drinks) and decaffeinated teas are all great choices  just be sure you keep an eye on pasteurization, calorie info and all that. You should, however, limit your intake of soda (nothing but empty calories), as well as other beverages containing caffeine, since they have a diuretic effect (besides the other reasons to cut the  caffeine during pregnancy).Keep in mind, too, that about 20 percent of our daily water intake comes from food sources. Fruits pack the most water: One cup of watermelon or cantaloupe provides just under five ounces of water; a medium-size pear or one cup of strawberries provides about four and a half ounces; a medium size orange has four ounces. Got the sniffles? A cup of chicken soup yields roughly six ounces of water.Updated 2/20/153 things to read next:The 12 Best Foods to Eat While Pregnant Foods to Avoid During PregnancyThe Pregnancy Diet"

"14 Moms Say ""Buh-Bye"" to the Baby Weight",http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/how-real-moms-lose-baby-weight/,"Let's get real: Losing the baby weight isnt as easy as gaining those pregnancy pounds. During pregnancy our baby grows and our belly expands. Then, our baby is born, and, well, things may be different than they once were.Im no expert on slimming down. After each of my children, its been a slow process to get back to my former weight  or something close to it because I doubt my hips will ever recover after birthing a 10-pound baby! These moms, though? They're sharing tips that helped them to shed pounds in a healthy way and feel great about their mom bods. See which ones could work for you:I try to make good food choices. But I'm careful not to be so strict that I set myself up to binge. Hangry mama + tired mama is a very bad combo.  Caitlin M., mom of 3I cut out dairy and started taking vitamin B12 and a probiotic. And yoga! Yoga has done wonders with my body and mind. Stephanie C., mom of 2I eat nutrient-dense foods (local or organic and non-gmo foods, bone broth, sea salt, coconut oil, avocado oil, olive oil, ghee, seaweed and honey). That, plus vegan supplements and breastfeeding has put me in the best body shape of my life!  Kari H., mom of 4I tried ""mommy-and-me"" workouts but found that I was focused on my daughter the whole time. Barre class, on the other hand, was a time for ME, and I could focus on gaining strength and having fun.  Aimee B., mom of 1I cut processed foods. My philosophy: Dont eat anything my great great grandma wouldn't eat. Ann-Erica W., mom of 1I prep healthy snacks ahead of time and portion them out using those extra-small Ziploc containers so I don't binge on bad stuff during those middle-of-the-night feedings. Hummus, guacamole, peanut butter with celery, carrots and blue corn chips with flax are some faves. I love Honeycrisp apples sliced with sharp cheddar cheese as well! I also make a dried berries trail mix with cranberries, blueberries, goji berries, pepitas and cherries.  Emily T., mom of 3I read that you only need to work out for 30 or 45 minutes a day to lose weight. I do my best to fit in a workout more mornings than not!  Samantha H., mom of 1I work out at home 30 minutes a day (before kiddos wake up) and follow a healthy eating plan. But I discovered I need support and accountability to stick to it. That's why I joined an online accountability group and log in workouts, measurements, etc. every day.  Kendra M., mom of 2Here are my food rules: I sit down at the table for every meal. I have a glass of water before any snacks. And no eating after 7 p.m. (the one rule I battle most).  Christine D., mom of 2I was never able to actively lose weight while exclusively breastfeeding  only when my milk was not the primary source of nutrition for my baby did I start shedding pounds. Women are told breastfeeding burns calories, but for some reason, all those nursing hormones actually make our bodies hold on to the weight. I wish I had understood this with my first two and given myself more grace. Valerie R., mom of 4I started going for a daily walk, and I cut out all added sugars and most grains from my diet. I made a point of not weighing myself, so I don't know how much I've lost, but I feel like myself again  something that hasn't happened since before kids!  Sarah G., mom of 3When the weather is nice, I grab a friend, strap my baby in the baby carrier, put my older kids in the stroller and go for a long walk, stopping at the park before we go home. Fresh air, exercise, chats with friends, the park  it's always a good time!  Lorean S., mom of 3 (with 1 on the way!)I've learned that it takes about a year for me to feel like ""me"" again after having a baby. This means that with every child, there's been a two-year hiatus (taking into account conception, pregnancy, delivery and postpartum) from feeling like myself. I do what I can to make healthy choices during that time, but I allow my mind, body and soul to do what it needs to get through those months. Instead of setting a bunch of fitness or number goals, which I ultimately fail at during that postpartum year, I work on nourishing instead of restricting myself.  Jamie D., mom of 3I eat (mostly) clean, nutritious food and lots of healthy fats! I find it's so much easier to eat healthier when someone else depends on me to!  Chelsea M., mom of 2So there you have it. Healthy food, movement, grace and accountability  those are the secrets to feeling great in your new, amazing mom bod!RELATED STORIESTrendingSurprise!

Vitamin K Injection in Newborns,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vitamin-k-injection.aspx,"What is a vitamin K shot? A single injection of vitamin K containing .5 to 1 milligram of the nutrient is given in one of your babys thighs.In This Series first yearNewborn Hearing Screening Tests pregnancyYour Babys Apgar Tests Eye Ointment for Newborns The Heel-Stick Test Hepatitis B Vaccine Critical Congenital Heart Disease ScreeningWhen is it done? Newborns will get a vitamin K shot usually within the first six hours of birth  and certainly by the time they leave the hospital.Why do babies need vitamin K? Vitamin K is necessary for the blood to clot. All babies have low levels of K when theyre born, so the shot reduces the chances of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), which happens in a small percentage of babies. Newborns who have VKDB may have blood in their stool or urine, or they may ooze blood from the skin around the umbilical cord. The bleeding can be fatal. Babies are at higher risk of VKDB if they dont get the shot, if theyre exclusively breastfed (because cows milk formula contains more vitamin K than human milk), or if their mothers take antiseizure medications. The condition is most common in the first days of life, but it can also appear after two weeks.Is it standard? Yes, receiving the vitamin K shot is common practice for all babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first started recommending it in 1961.Should you ask for it? You wont have to.Are vitamin K shots safe? The vitamin K shot is safe, even though in the early 1990s, British researchers published data that found an association between vitamin K injections in newborns and childhood leukemia. But since then, many scientists have looked at the same data as well as additional research and found no link. The AAP has also analyzed the British data, plus research on children in the US, and found no association between the shot and childhood leukemia or other cancers. The AAP has also stated that recent studies on how childhood leukemia develops show that its unlikely vitamin K injections have anything to do with it.Can you ask for vitamin K as an oral dose instead of as a shot for your newborn? There are oral doses of vitamin K, but they arent as effective at preventing the VKDB that can develop after the first few days of your babys life. Because an oral dose of K can't protect babies against later-stage VKDB (which can happen anytime between the age of two weeks and six months) as well as the shot can, it's typically not an option for newborns in the United States."
Half of Breastfeeding Moms Not Giving Babies Important Vitamin D Supplement,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/breastfeeding-moms-not-giving-babies-vitamin-d-study/,"Breast milk is natures ideal food -- but it doesnt offer enough of the vitamin D babies need to support their rapidly growing bones. Thats why doctors recommend giving breastfed babies 400 IUs of a liquid vitamin D every day. However a new study finds that only about one in two breastfeeding moms may be offering their babies this important supplement. That amounts to half of breastfed infants who may not be getting the vitamins they need.What the study foundResearchers at the Mayo Clinic surveyed a total of 184 moms, 140 who exclusively breastfed and 44 who supplemented with formula. Only 55 percent of nursing moms gave their babies the recommended vitamin D supplement, and just 42 percent gave their babies the full 400 IUs. The study, published in the journal Annals of Family Medicine, found that a full 88 percent of moms in the study said theyd rather pop a pill themselves than give a vitamin to their babies. Many cited safety as the most important consideration in choosing how to ensure their infants were getting the recommended amount of vitamin D.What moms should knowBabies need 400 IUs of vitamin D in their diets every day to avoid preventable and potentially serious health complications. Severe deficiency can lead to rickets (soft bones), seizures due to low calcium, and even heart failure in infants, explains Tom Thacher, MD, a professor of family medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study.Babies can, however, reap the benefits if Mom takes a vitamin D supplement herself -- but only if the dose is high enough. The authors note that one of the advantages of the mother taking the vitamin is that its slightly easier for an adult to pop a pill than it is to administer a dropper of medicine (even if it does taste yummy) to baby. Whats more, taking a pill helps avoid baby dosing errors (which are more common than you might think but easily avoidable if you carefully follow the instructions on the bottle).Many moms continue to take a prenatal vitamin after birth, but they contain just 600 IUs of D -- not nearly enough to cover both Mom and baby. And no more than 10 percent of the daily dose a mother takes is found in a liter of her breast milk, explains Thacher.If a mother takes 4000 IU per day, her breast milk will typically contain approximately 400 IU in one liter, or 32 ounces, says Thacher. But newborns do not consistently consume up to one liter per day until they reach the age of 3 months, so moms may take doses up to 6000 IU per day in order to meet the infants recommended intake.The authors conclude that taking an additional daily supplement of 6000 IUs of vitamin D for the first three months of babys life on top of whats already in a prenatal vitamin would be a safe and effective way for breastfeeding moms to cover their babies needs through breast milk. After the third month, when babys eating more, you could drop down to 4000 IUs per day.What you can doIf youd like to skip the vitamin D supplement for your breastfeeding baby, talk to your doctor about taking it yourself. He or she can help you determine if its the right choice for both of you, as well as the advise you on the exact dose you should take."
Vitamin D Deficiency During Pregnancy May Be Linked to MS Diagnosis for Child,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0308/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-pregnancy-may-increase-ms-risk-in-kid,"You may have already heard about the reported benefits of getting enough vitamin D during pregnancy,which include everything from reduced risk of severe preeclampsiaandpreterm birthfor you, to stronger musclesand lower allergy risklater of life in your child. And since getting plenty of vitamin D has already been associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adulthood, experts also began to wonder if exposure to vitamin D in utero might have the same protective effect on a childs risk of MS later in life. Now a newstudyfrom Harvards School of Public Health, published online this week in the journal JAMA Neurology, suggests that children of moms with vitamin D deficiency during early pregnancy may be at greater risk of developing MS in adulthood.What the study foundThe researchers looked at over 175 people with a diagnosis of MS whose mothers were part of an earlier study in Finland and compared them with a control group of those without MS. The scientists then looked at blood samples from these individuals mothers that had been collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. According to the results, the risk of MS was significantly higher in children whose moms were deficient in vitamin D compared with the children of moms whose vitamin D levels were adequate.Vitamin D 101Vitamin D is essential for immune system function, and it combines with calcium to help grow yourbaby'sbones and teeth and keep yours strong.

That's why many doctors recommend vitamin D supplementation (which you should already be getting from your prenatal vitamin!).Limitations of this studyThese findings seem to point to an obvious fix: Ensure all expectant moms are getting enough vitamin D. But before you jump to the conclusion that this vitamin will protect all babies from a future diagnosis of MS, it's important to understand the study's limitations.First, the level of vitamin D measured in an expecting womans blood is not a direct measure of the vitamin D levels that her baby is exposed to in utero.Second, this study only shows an association between a maternal deficiency in vitamin D during pregnancy and MS in offspring. And that doesnt actually prove that getting enough vitamin D during pregnancy protects a baby from a future MS diagnosis.Finally, some experts point out that the study didnt account for any other variables (such as moms BMI; smoking and other lifestyle habits; sun exposure; activity level; or family history of MS). Plus their statistical accounting was a little arbitrary (meaning if the data were interpreted using a different yet equally valid statistical method, the results would looks vastly different)  making the association between vitamin D levels and MS less clear than the study makes it sound.What this means for youWhile no amount of any food can come close to the recommended daily intake, it's still important to consume as much of thesehealthy sources of vitamin D in your dietas possible (all are also chock fully of other pregnancy-friendly nutrients):Fortified milk, cereal and juicesSardinesEgg yolksLow-mercury fatty fish, like salmonMushroomsThat said, the only practical way to consume enough vitamin D is through supplements  one moreexcellent reason to make sure youre taking a prenatal supplement containing this vital vitamin daily.3 things to read next:Foods high in vitamin DChoosing a prenatal vitaminNutrients that make a baby"

That Article Saying Prenatal Vitamins Are Unnecessary Is a Total Scam,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0713/that-article-saying-prenatal-vitamins-are-harmful-is-a-total-scam,"By now youve probably seen the British article questioning whether prenatal vitamins are really necessary with some media even insinuating the supplements are a scam (ahem, New YorkMagazine).Dont listen. To be clear, this paper is just a review, not a study. In other words, its an opinion piece. And the advice it offers, experts say, can be potentially dangerous.As medical practitioners will tell you, there are a number of nutrients women need during pregnancy, and Americans are deficient in many of them. Not getting enough while youre expecting can have devastating effects for both mom and baby.  Save Now On Alive! Get Your Coupon For Any Alive! Multi-Vitamin FeelAlive.com   I dont agree that prenatals are a thing of past, says Scott Sullivan, MD, the director of maternal-fetal medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). We have good data on a lot of these nutrients, so its premature to say we should just abandon prenatal vitamins.The review, published in the journalDrug and Therapeutics Bulletin, looked at past research to determine whether taking folic acid, iron, and vitamins A, C, D and E during pregnancy reduced the risks of complications including preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight or stillbirth.READ ALSO: Choosing the Best Prenatal VitaminThe authors concluded that British women only need to take two supplements: 400 mcg of folic acid (before and up through 12 weeks of pregnancy), and vitamin D (which they said appeared to beneficial, though not as clear cut as folic acid). They added that much evidence for taking supplementation in pregnancy comes from studies done in low-income countries,where women are more likely to be malnourished.But there are several other nutrients ACOG recommends in a supplement for good reason. Here's the truth behind prenatal vitaims and exactly why you and your baby need them.Calcium: ACOG recommends all women, not just pregnant women, get at least 1000 mg of calcium of day. But calcium is especially important during pregnancy, since what you consume helps build babys teeth and skeleton. If youre not getting enough in your diet, baby will take it from your bones one reason why women whove been pregnant are at higher risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis.Vitamin D, in turn, works with calcium to help support the demands of pregnancy. Without enough, your body cant process the calcium you need.Iron: Anemia is very common in pregnancy, Sullivan notes. ""Thirty to 40 percent of my patients are iron deficient, he says. Being anemic can make you feel even more sick than pregnancy already does, plus put you at risk of a blood transfusion during delivery and complications in future pregnancies. Its very hard to be sure youre getting enough, which is why ACOG recommends supplementing, Sullivan says.READ ALSO: Your Prenatal Diet: An InfographicIodine: A quarter of American women are deficient in iodine, says Sullivan, because people are eating less table salt and seafood, the nutrients two major sources. If you dont get enough iodine when youre expecting, it puts baby at risk for neurodevelopmental issues. Most women need a supplement of about 120 to 150 mcg. About half of all American prenatals currently contain iodine, Sullivan says, but all will in about two years.Two more nutrients that are wise to get from your prenatalarevitamin B6 (which can help curb morning sickness) and omega 3 (which helps build babys brain).Because there are so many of these recommended nutrients, a prenatal vitamin should be a heck of a lot easier and cheaper than taking a bunch of individual supplements. Sure, there are pricey ones out there, but they're not always the best, and some really good ones are cheap, Sullivan says.Still skeptical? Talk to your doctor about your diet and individual nutritional needs. What you eat is vitally important, and you cant get everything you need from a supplement, either. But your doctor will almost definitely recommend taking one anyway. Ask his or her advice to find the best, most cost-effective option.Some people need B12 supplements, some are people very low in vitamin D, some people have anemia,"" Sullivan says. ""All of which makes supplementing more complex than [the authors] would make it appear."

This daily pill is an insurance policy, offering you the security of knowing that your body is stocking up on the most essential baby-making vitamins it needs to conceive and nourish your baby-to-be through a healthy pregnancy. Heres how prenatal vitamins benefit you, along with how to choose the best prenatal vitamin.More in this article:Benefits of prenatal vitaminsNutrients you needSeals of approvalSolving for common problemsSafety tipsThe benefits of prenatal vitaminsTake a daily prenatal vitamin before you start trying to conceive and you'll thank yourself later. Prenatal vitamins:Cut back on nausea. Vitamin B6 helps to reduce nausea  and research has shown that women who take a daily multivitamin before conception and/or during the first few weeks of pregnancy experience fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting during the first trimester (aka ""morning sickness"").Boost fertility. Not only will you be ensuring a healthier baby, you'll also be upping the chances that you'll actually make that healthy baby faster.Some research has shown that taking a prenatal vitamin may actually help increase fertility. Reduce risk of birth defects. Perhaps the most important (and best publicized) reason to take a prenatal vitamin is for the folic acid (known as folate when it's in food form) it contains. Studies show that getting enough folic acid before sperm meets egg and in the early stages ofpregnancy can dramatically reduce the risk of neural tube defects (like spina bifida) in your developing baby.Choose the best prenatal vitaminThere are plenty of prenatal vitamin supplements on the market  so how do you pick? Your individual needs may differ, so its best to work directly with your doctor when determining the best plan for your prenatal vitamins. In the meantime, here are a few tips to help you choose the best prenatal vitamin:Get the right nutrientsTake a look at the label of any prenatal vitamin youre considering for a few key vitamins:Folic acid: 600 mcg. Since babys neural tube forms in the first month of pregnancy  before most women know that theyre pregnant  its ideal to start taking your prenatal vitamin before you start trying to conceive. So in addition to eating plenty of folate-rich foods, opt for a vitamin with at least 600 mcg of folic acid (aka vitamin B9) throughout your pregnancy. For women whose family history shows a high risk of neural tube defects, guidelines recommend aiming for 10 times that amount (or four mg) from folic acid supplements  but always talk to your doctor before taking any additional supplements.Calcium: 150 mg. Another crucial nutrient for women, calcium is especially important when you're growing another set of bones (your baby's). All women ages 19 to 50 need 1,000 mg per day. In addition to getting plenty of calcium in your diet from milk, yogurt or other calcium-rich foods, make sure some is in your prenatal vitamin. If your doctor is still concerned youre not getting enough, he may recommend you take an additional supplement.Iron: 27mg. This mineral is the building block for babys cells  and your body needs more than ever during pregnancy. If, like many women, you become anemic during pregnancy, your doctor may recommend that you take more.Iodine: 150 mcg.Iodine aids your baby-to-be's thyroid and brain development and studies have shown that many American women arent getting enough of this essential mineral. Thats why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pregnant women take a daily supplement of iodine and cook with iodized salt for a total intake of 220 mcg per day. If the supplement youre considering doesnt have any (or enough) iodine, talk to your doctor about taking a separate iodine supplement.Vitamin B6: 1.9mg. This B vitamin helps decrease the potential for morning sickness  in fact, prescription morning sickness drugs are a combination of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and doxylamine (an antihistamine).Omega 3 fatty acids: Talk to your doctor. Regular prenatal vitamins dont contain omega-3 fatty acids  a healthy type of fat found in many types of fish. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to aid in babys brain development, both before and after birth. If youre unable to get the recommended two to three servings (8 to 12 ounces) of pregnancy-safe fatty fish per week, ask your doctor if you should take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement.A few other nutrients to be aware of:Vitamin A: No more than 10,000 IU. More can be toxic. Look for beta-carotene, the safest source of vitamin A.Vitamin D: 600 IU. Your body needs vitamin D, in combination with calcium, to grow your babys bones and keep yours strong. If your doctor suspects you may not be getting enough vitamin D (a relatively common issue among women), he or she may screen your levels at your first prenatal checkup. If youre deficient, hell recommend that you take an additional supplement of 1,000 to 2,000 IU.Zinc: 11 mg. This mineral supports your immune system and healthy cell division. Copper: 0.9 mg. Your body uses this trace element to form blood cells as well as maintain nerve, bone and immune system health.Vitamin C: 85 mg. You can get plenty of this vitamin, which helps your body to absorb iron and supports your immune system, in your prenatal diet. More than 2,000 mg can be dangerous for your baby  so as always, dont take a supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin unless recommended by your doctor.Other: Most prenatals contain two to three times the dietary reference intake (DRI) for vitamin E (12 mg), thiamin (1.2mg), riboflavin (1.2 mg), niacin (14 mg) and vitamin B12 (2.2 mg)  and there are no known harmful effects from such doses. Some preparations also contain magnesium, fluoride, biotin, phosphorus, pantothenic acid, extra B6 (to combat queasiness) and/or ginger (ditto).If you're avegetarian or vegan during pregnancy, be sure to tell your doctor to ensure you're getting the right nutrients in your supplements.Look for an independent seal of approvalSeveral groups independently verify dietary supplements (including prenatal vitamins) using rigorous criteria. If youd like extra reassurance that your supplement meets high standards, look for seals from the following organizations:United States Pharmacopeia (USP)NSF InternationalConsumer LabHowever keep in mind that getting approval from one of these groups is a voluntary, not required, step for manufacturers. So if your prenatal vitamin isnt marked with one of these seals, it doesnt necessarily mean its not good. Bottom line: If youre at all concerned about the quality of the supplement youre taking, talk to your doctor. Figure out if you can stomach itOnce you choose your prenatal vitamin, you might find you have a tough time stomaching it. The most common reasons (and solutions):If you have trouble swallowing it, look for a pill with a slicker coating. You may want to consider a pill sans calcium, since they tend to be smaller (calcium takes up a lot of space  if you do, be sure to talk to your practitioner to be sure you get enough of this essential mineral in other ways). You might also want to try a chewable or liquid prenatal vitamin (though you may have to try a few to find one with a taste that works for you).If it makes you feel nauseous, try taking your vitamin with a meal or snack or right before you go to bed. Still having trouble? Try the above tips  or ask your doctor to recommend a different brand that you may be able to stomach better.If youve got constipation, diarrhea or gas, it could be the extra iron in your pill. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids, eat fiber-rich foods and include regular physical activity in your daily routine. If this doesnt relieve your stomach woes, talk to your doctor about alternatives (i.e., a supplement without iron, or a separate iron preparation that dissolves in the intestines rather than in the more sensitive stomach, or one that is slow-release).Dont Overdo ItMore isn't better when it comes to vitamins. So stick with the recommended dosage, and don't take other extra supplements unless your doctor recommends it. Check in with your practitioner, too, if you're taking herbal supplements; some herbs can be harmful when you're trying to conceive.Keep in mind that prenatal vitamins complement a healthy diet, but they dont replace it. That means its still vitally important to eat a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet throughout your pregnancy. Think of your prenatal vitamin as a backup  not the other way around.Updated 8/27/15"

Prenatal Vitamins and Nausea,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ask-heidi/prenatal-vitamins-and-nausea.aspx,"When youre constantly queasy, the last thing you can stomach is the thought of swallowing a horse-sized pill chock-full of nausea-inducing vitamins and minerals. And yet, because you know that you  and, more importantly, your baby  need the nutrients, its hard to stop popping the pill (as much as it makes you miserable).The reality is, for most expectant moms its all too easy to fall short on the vitamins and minerals you and your baby need  especially during the early months of pregnancy when morning (and afternoon, and evening) sickness rules supreme. And since thats the stage of pregnancy when much of your babys most crucial construction occurs  like the formation of the organs and critical systems (particularly the nervous system and spine, which requires adequate doses of the vitamin folic acid, or folate)  prenatal vitamins are excellent insurance.Insurance is all well and good (you may be thinking), but do you have to suffer to reap the rewards? Of course not. There are plenty of ways to make the pill more palatable:Change when you take your pill. Try taking your vitamin at the time of day when youre least nauseated. Sure, its easy to get in the habit of taking vitamins first thing in the morning (right after the deodorant, right before the toothbrushing), but your body doesnt care one way or another when the nutrients arrive. Some women find that their rolling stomach calms down late in the evening, and if thats when your queasiness quiets, give the pill a go then.Eat first.Whatever time of day you pop the pill, make sure your tummy isnt running on empty. All pills, including vitamins, are easier to stomach when accompanied by food, so try to eat something before you take the supplement. (Its a good idea anyway to avoid an empty tummy when youre sidelined with morning sickness. Without food to keep them busy, your stomach acids start to chew on you, a process that, not surprisingly, produces nausea.)Ask your doctor for recommendations. If your prenatal vitamin is still making you sick, your practitioner may be able to prescribe a brand that wont be so tough on your tummy. The iron in prenatal vitamins can be particularly hard to digest, so you might get a formulation with less (or none, for now). One high in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may be able to quell the quease (ask your practitioner if he or she advises extra B6 supplements). Sometimes, over-the-counter formulas are better tolerated, although youll want to carefully check the labels to make sure they offer the right amount of vitamins and minerals. Or ask about slow-release supplements or chewables, which could provide some relief.At least theres a light at the end of the tunnel. Your nausea should abate within the next few weeks, and, with luck, youll be able to better tolerate those supplements.Heres to better feeling days ahead!"

Do I have to take a prenatal vitamin, or can I just take a regular multivitamin?A. Prenatal vitamins are the best choice for pregnant women. Regular multivitamins could leave you with a serious deficit in key nutrients, especially folic acid, iron and calcium. Folic acid, in particular, is recommended by doctors as a safeguard against neural tube defects. A good brand of prenatal vitamins, such as Nature Made, will provide you with targeted nutrition that meets the special needs of the pregnant woman.Q. What nutrients should I look for in a prenatal vitamin?A. Folic acid, iron, and calcium, as mentioned above. Prenatal vitamins have increased amounts of these nutrients to support the proper development of a baby's nervous system (folic acid) and increased nutrient needs of expectant moms, especially for iron, which is essential for red blood cell formation. Other critical nutrients that your prenatal vitamin should contain are vitamins A, C, D and E, as well as zinc.Q. How do I know which brand is best?A. First and foremost, check to be sure that your brand is USP verified. This means that the U. S. Pharmacopeia Convention has assessed the supplement and that it has passed a series of stringent tests. Note that the USP testing is voluntary. So if a brand carries the mark, it means the manufacturers are confident in the purity and efficacy of their product. It also means you can buy the brand with confidence.Q. How often should I take a prenatal vitamin?A. Most prenatal vitamins are taken daily. Some require you to take several pills over the course of the day. However, one-a-day products are more convenient. Make sure to follow your doctor's directions when it comes to the number of vitamins to take each day.Q. When should I start taking a prenatal vitamin?A. As soon as you start trying to get pregnant. Healthcare professionals recommend that women who are hoping to conceive should begin taking prenatal multivitamins to ensure that they are getting adequate amounts of folic acid, and continue taking them through the entire pregnancy.This story was created for and approved by Nature Made, maker of prenatal vitamins formulated with essential vitamins and minerals for daily nutritional support before and during pregnancy."

But even if you're loading up on all the right stuff, and your plate is more colorful than a box of crayons, your doctor has probably recommended that you take a prenatal vitamin. Some of the key nutrients that are essential for your baby's development are hard to get through diet alone. Here's a quick guide to what you should look for in a prenatal vitamin  and what to avoid.THE SUPERSTARSPrenatal vitamins contain important nutrients, including folic acid, iron and calcium that help support your growing baby as well as your nutrient needs during pregnancy.Folic Acid. This B vitamin plays a critical role in the proper development of a baby's nervous system. Adequate folic acid, in a healthy diet, may reduce the risk for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD). This occurs when the neural tube, which later develops into the brain and spine, fails to close properly during the first two trimesters.Iron. Your pregnant body is manufacturing additional blood for both you and your baby. Iron is vital for red blood cell formation and a key part of hemoglobin, a protein that enables red blood cells to deliver oxygen throughout the body. Without adequate iron, you could become anemic.Calcium. Calcium helps build and support strong bones. It's important throughout your pregnancy, but calcium takes center stage during your third trimester, when your baby's bones are growing quickly.SUPPORTING PLAYERSThese nutrients play an important supporting role in your prenatal health. Check to be sure your prenatal vitamin contains all these elements as well:Vitamins A, C and D, as well as zinc, which help support the immune system.Vitamins C and E, which are antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals.B vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12, which support cellular energy production.WHAT TO AVOIDWhat's not in your prenatal vitamin is almost as important as what is. Check the label on your vitamin to make sure you don't see any of the following:Synthetic dyesAdded colorArtificial flavorPreservativesYeast or starchGlutenSTARTING A PRENATAL VITAMIN REGIMENAs with any dietary supplement, be sure to check with your healthcare practitioner before beginning a regimen. And of course, take only the recommended amount, so you get the benefits of a healthy body and a healthy baby.High-quality, trusted prenatal vitamins like Nature Made's Multi Prenatal, which is USP* verified for purity and potency**, are scientifically formulated with essential vitamins and minerals for daily nutritional support before and during pregnancy.* The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) is a scientific, nonprofit organization that sets federally recognized public standards of quality for medicines, dietary supplements, and foods.

6 Need-to-Know Nutrients for Ulcerative Colitis,,
Colds During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/colds-during-pregnancy/,"When youre expecting, your immune system runs at a lower speed than usual  which is actually a good thing, since it keeps your body from fighting off the baby (who is, technically, a foreigner to your body, even if he or she doesnt seem foreign to you). The downside of this immune suppression, though, is that your body can't fight off colds as well as it normally does, making you more vulnerable than usual to the stuffy nose, cough and sore throat that come with the virus.Fortunately, colds are mostly an uncomfortable annoyance. That said, its important to be aware that youre better off avoiding some cold medications during pregnancy. Heres what you need to know to feel better and stay safe.What causes colds during pregnancy?Colds are most commonly caused by a type of virus known as a rhinovirus. There are 200 or more cold viruses, which is why you keep on getting them.What are the symptoms of colds?A cold usually begins with a sore or scratchy throat that lasts for a day or two, followed by the gradual appearance of cold symptoms, including:A runny (and later stuffy) noseLots of sneezingMild fatigueA dry cough, particularly near the colds end, which may continue for a week or more after other symptoms have subsidedLittle or no fever (usually under 100F)Is it a cold  or the flu?You can usually tell the difference between a cold and the flu by taking stock of the symptoms.A cold, even a bad one, is milder than the flu. Its symptoms come on gradually, and theres usually no fever. The sore throat that usually starts off the cold goes away after a day or two, leaving the runny nose and cough as the main symptoms.Influenza (a.k.a. the flu) is more severe and comes on more suddenly than a cold. Symptoms of the flu include high fever (usually 102F to 104F or higher), headache, chills, a sore throat that generally worsens by the second or third day (unlike in the cold), often intense muscle soreness, and general weakness and fatigue (which can last a couple of weeks or longer). You may also experience occasional sneezing and a cough that can become severe.What can you do if you get a cold during pregnancy?Although many of the medications that relieve cold symptoms are typically off-limits during pregnancy, you dont have to suffer with a runny nose and hacking cough when youre pregnant. Some of the most effective cold remedies dont come from the pharmacy shelf. These tips can help you feel better faster:Rest. Taking a cold to bed doesnt necessarily shorten its duration, but if your body is begging for some rest, be sure to listen.Stay active. If youre not running a fever or coughing and you feel up to it, light to moderate, pregnancy-safe exercise may actually help you feel better faster.Keep eating. Sure, you probably dont have much of an appetite, but eating as healthily as possible when you do feel up to eating can help with some of your cold symptoms.Focus on foods with vitamin C. Theycan help boost your immune system naturally. Try all types of citrus fruits (oranges, tangerines, grapefruit), strawberries, melon, kiwi, mango, tomatoes, bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, red cabbage and spinach.Chow down on more zinc.It may also help boost the immune system. Fill up on turkey, beef, pork, cooked oysters, eggs, yogurt, wheat germ and oatmeal.Drink up. Fever, sneezes and a runny nose will cause your body to lose fluids that you and your baby need. Warm beverages will be particularly soothing, so keep a thermos of a hot drink (like ginger tea) or hot soup (like chicken broth) next to your bed and try to drink enough to stay well hydrated (your pee should be the color of pale straw). Water and cold juices work fine, too, if thats what youre thirsting for.Supplement safely. Taking your prenatal vitamin, which contains vitamin C and zinc, is smart even when youre fighting a cold (but dont take any other supplements beyond your prenatal without your doctors approval).Sleep easy. Breathe easier when youre lying down or sleeping by elevating your head with a couple of pillows. Nasal strips (which gently pull your nasal passages open, making breathing easier) may help, too. Theyre sold over the counter and are completely drug-free.When to see the doctorCall your doctor if:You have a fever over 100 FYour cold is severe enough to interfere with eating or sleepingYoure coughing up greenish or yellowish mucusYou have a cough with chest pain or wheezingYour sinuses are throbbingIf symptoms last more than 10 to 14 days: Its possible that your cold has progressed to a secondary infection, and a prescription medication may be needed for your safety and your babysSafe medications for colds during pregnancyBefore you reach for anything in your medicine cabinet when youre in bed with a cold, reach for the phone to call your practitioner so you can ask which remedies are considered safe in pregnancy, as well as which will work best in your case. Some remedies youre used to taking may not be safe during pregnancy.So what cold medications are generally considered safe during pregnancy?Acetaminophen. If you're running a fever or suffering from nasty body aches or headaches, it's generally considered safe to take products containing acetaminophen (like Tylenol).Cough medications. Expectorants (like Mucinex), cough suppressants (such as Robitussin or Vicks44), vapor rubs (like Vicks) as well as most cough drops are considered safe during pregnancy, but ask your practitioner about dosing.Some nasal sprays. Most steroid-containing nasal sprays are fine to use during pregnancy, but check with your doctor about brands and dosing. Plain saline drops and sprays are always safe to take when you're expecting and can help clear and moisturize a stuffy nose.Some antihistamines. Benadryl and Claritin often get the green light during pregnancy, but be sure to check with your practitioner before taking them. Some doctors will advise staying away from those medications in the first trimester.Always check with your practitioner before you take any medication (prescription, over the counter or homeopathic), or consult the instruction sheet she gave you on your first visit. And dont put off calling the doctor or refuse to take a medication she prescribes because you think all drugs are harmful in pregnancy. Many are not. But do be sure the prescribing doctor knows youre expecting.Medications to avoid during pregnancySome of the medications that could help with cold symptoms are off limits to moms-to-be because they may cause harm to their unborn baby. These include:Some pain relievers and fever reducers. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) can interfere with your baby's development in the early months and be problematic during labor.Most decongestants. Most practitioners say to stay clear of decongestants such as Claritin-D, Sudafed or DayQuil. Even those experts who say its okay to take some decongestants will probably caution that they're only safe to use after the first trimester, and only in a limited amount (i.e. once or twice daily for no more than a day or two).Some nasal sprays. Steer clear of nonsteroidal nasal decongestant sprays containing ozymetazoline (like Afrin) unless given the green light by your practitioner. Many will tell you to avoid these sprays completely while you're expecting, while others will advise only limited use (one or two days at a time) after the first trimester.Homeopathic remedies. Dont take Echinacea, supplemental vitamins (like zinc supplements) or other over-the-counter herbal remedies without medical approval.Alternative treatments for coldNot one for taking medications to alleviate those cold symptoms? You can try the following natural ways to treat your cold:Eat fresh garlic. Garlic is known to have virus-fighting compounds, so take a bite or two or add to soup or stir-fry.Run a humidifier. Keeping your nasal passages moist will ease congestion, especially at night.Saline nose drops, sprays or rinses. These help moisten your nasal passages; since theyre un-medicated, theyre completely safe to use as often as you need. (Just avoid neti pots, since theyre more apt to spread germs.)Saltwater gargles. Gargling with warm salt water (1/4 teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water) can ease a scratchy or sore throat, wash away postnasal drip and help control a cough.Honey. A couple of teaspoons straight (or mixed in hot water with lemon) has been shown to help suppress the kind of dry cough that often comes with and after a cold at least as effectively as an OTC cough syrup.Updated 2/28/173 things to read next:Fever During PregnancyHow to Baby Yourself When Youre Sick During PregnancyAllergies During Pregnancy"

Half of Breastfeeding Moms Not Giving Babies Important Vitamin D Supplement,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/breastfeeding-moms-not-giving-babies-vitamin-d-study/,"Breast milk is natures ideal food -- but it doesnt offer enough of the vitamin D babies need to support their rapidly growing bones. Thats why doctors recommend giving breastfed babies 400 IUs of a liquid vitamin D every day. However a new study finds that only about one in two breastfeeding moms may be offering their babies this important supplement. That amounts to half of breastfed infants who may not be getting the vitamins they need.What the study foundResearchers at the Mayo Clinic surveyed a total of 184 moms, 140 who exclusively breastfed and 44 who supplemented with formula. Only 55 percent of nursing moms gave their babies the recommended vitamin D supplement, and just 42 percent gave their babies the full 400 IUs. The study, published in the journal Annals of Family Medicine, found that a full 88 percent of moms in the study said theyd rather pop a pill themselves than give a vitamin to their babies. Many cited safety as the most important consideration in choosing how to ensure their infants were getting the recommended amount of vitamin D.What moms should knowBabies need 400 IUs of vitamin D in their diets every day to avoid preventable and potentially serious health complications. Severe deficiency can lead to rickets (soft bones), seizures due to low calcium, and even heart failure in infants, explains Tom Thacher, MD, a professor of family medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study.  Save Now On Alive! Get Your Coupon For Any Alive! Multi-Vitamin FeelAlive.com   Babies can, however, reap the benefits if Mom takes a vitamin D supplement herself -- but only if the dose is high enough. The authors note that one of the advantages of the mother taking the vitamin is that its slightly easier for an adult to pop a pill than it is to administer a dropper of medicine (even if it does taste yummy) to baby. Whats more, taking a pill helps avoid baby dosing errors (which are more common than you might think but easily avoidable if you carefully follow the instructions on the bottle).Many moms continue to take a prenatal vitamin after birth, but they contain just 600 IUs of D -- not nearly enough to cover both Mom and baby. And no more than 10 percent of the daily dose a mother takes is found in a liter of her breast milk, explains Thacher.If a mother takes 4000 IU per day, her breast milk will typically contain approximately 400 IU in one liter, or 32 ounces, says Thacher. But newborns do not consistently consume up to one liter per day until they reach the age of 3 months, so moms may take doses up to 6000 IU per day in order to meet the infants recommended intake.The authors conclude that taking an additional daily supplement of 6000 IUs of vitamin D for the first three months of babys life on top of whats already in a prenatal vitamin would be a safe and effective way for breastfeeding moms to cover their babies needs through breast milk. After the third month, when babys eating more, you could drop down to 4000 IUs per day.What you can doIf youd like to skip the vitamin D supplement for your breastfeeding baby, talk to your doctor about taking it yourself. He or she can help you determine if its the right choice for both of you, as well as the advise you on the exact dose you should take."

Fertility Supplements,http://www.whattoexpect.com/preconception/fertility-supplements.aspx,"No doubt many a mom-to-be has fantasized about taking a magic pill that would ensure a speedy path to pregnancy. One pill a day for a month, and voila, conception achieved! Unfortunately, a magic pregnancy pill is still far from reality. But that doesnt mean its not worth taking any pills in your quest for conception. For one thing, prenatal vitamins usually come in pill form and everyone agrees that popping one daily can get your body ready for baby (and possibly even make it easier to conceive). And research shows that there are also some natural fertility supplements that may help give you an extra edge in your pregnancy efforts. If youre interested in fertility supplements, be sure to talk to your practitioner before starting any of these:In This Series Natural Fertility Treatments Boosting Male Fertility Fertility Foods for Men Fertility FoodsHerbal Fertility SupplementsMany holistic practitioners (and happy parents) swear by the baby-making benefits of these herbal supplements:Chaste tree berry is thought to stimulate luteinizing hormone (LH) production and to help balance progesterone and estrogen levels in order to regulate the menstrual cycle.Red clover is also thought to help balance hormone function. Plus, it contains isoflavones (estrogen-like compounds), which may promote estrogen production and enhance fertility.Siberian ginseng is believed to regulate hormones and support uterine function.Ladys mantle is thought to help regulate the menstrual cycle and tone the cervix.Black cohosh is touted as improving hormone function due to its phytoestrogens (plant estrogens).The caveats: The FDA doesnt regulate herbal fertility supplements (let alone any herbal supplements), so it can be hard to know whether the herb you buy at the store is either effective or safe. There are some reputable brands of herbs on the market, and German products tend to be reliable because German regulations on herbal supplements are stricter than those in the US, but you should talk with your practitioner before you start popping any kind of fertility supplements. Also very important: Some herbal supplements can interfere with fertility and traditional fertility medicine (including the popular herbs St. Johns Wort and Echinacea), and many of them arent safe to take during pregnancy. So youll definitely want some expert advice before you go this route.Omega-3 Fatty Acid Fertility SupplementsThis nutritional supplement is quickly becoming widely accepted as good for overall health, and some research shows that it may even be helpful in regulating the menstrual cycle and boosting fertility. Whats more, omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to enhance mood, which may improve fertility (stress is a known fertility buster). Even more good news: Once you do get pregnant, omega-3 fatty acids may help decrease your chances of miscarriage and preterm labor, and help promote the development of your babys brain, eyes, and nervous system.The caveats: Theres no established optimal dose for omega-3 fatty acids  especially in the preconception period, which means it may be tricky to figure out how much you really need to take. Many prenatal vitamins (the ones you should be popping already if youre TTC since they contain essential nutrients like folic acid) contain omega-3 fatty acids, so you could already be getting a good amount. So talk with your practitioner to see if you should take extra omega-3s as fertility supplements or if you should simply add more omega-3-rich foods to your diet.

Luckily, there's nothing easier or more effective than popping a prenatal vitamin. This daily pill is an insurance policy, offering you the security of knowing that your body is stocking up on the most essential baby-making vitamins it needs to conceive and nourish your baby-to-be through a healthy pregnancy. Heres how prenatal vitamins benefit you, along with how to choose the best prenatal vitamin.More in this article:Benefits of prenatal vitaminsNutrients you needSeals of approvalSolving for common problemsSafety tipsThe benefits of prenatal vitaminsTake a daily prenatal vitamin before you start trying to conceive and you'll thank yourself later. Prenatal vitamins:Cut back on nausea. Vitamin B6 helps to reduce nausea  and research has shown that women who take a daily multivitamin before conception and/or during the first few weeks of pregnancy experience fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting during the first trimester (aka ""morning sickness"").Boost fertility. Not only will you be ensuring a healthier baby, you'll also be upping the chances that you'll actually make that healthy baby faster.Some research has shown that taking a prenatal vitamin may actually help increase fertility. Reduce risk of birth defects. Perhaps the most important (and best publicized) reason to take a prenatal vitamin is for the folic acid (known as folate when it's in food form) it contains. Studies show that getting enough folic acid before sperm meets egg and in the early stages ofpregnancy can dramatically reduce the risk of neural tube defects (like spina bifida) in your developing baby.Choose the best prenatal vitaminThere are plenty of prenatal vitamin supplements on the market  so how do you pick? Your individual needs may differ, so its best to work directly with your doctor when determining the best plan for your prenatal vitamins. In the meantime, here are a few tips to help you choose the best prenatal vitamin:Get the right nutrientsTake a look at the label of any prenatal vitamin youre considering for a few key vitamins:Folic acid: 600 mcg. Since babys neural tube forms in the first month of pregnancy  before most women know that theyre pregnant  its ideal to start taking your prenatal vitamin before you start trying to conceive. So in addition to eating plenty of folate-rich foods, opt for a vitamin with at least 600 mcg of folic acid (aka vitamin B9) throughout your pregnancy. For women whose family history shows a high risk of neural tube defects, guidelines recommend aiming for 10 times that amount (or four mg) from folic acid supplements  but always talk to your doctor before taking any additional supplements.Calcium: 150 mg. Another crucial nutrient for women, calcium is especially important when you're growing another set of bones (your baby's). All women ages 19 to 50 need 1,000 mg per day. In addition to getting plenty of calcium in your diet from milk, yogurt or other calcium-rich foods, make sure some is in your prenatal vitamin. If your doctor is still concerned youre not getting enough, he may recommend you take an additional supplement.Iron: 27mg. This mineral is the building block for babys cells  and your body needs more than ever during pregnancy. If, like many women, you become anemic during pregnancy, your doctor may recommend that you take more.Iodine: 150 mcg.Iodine aids your baby-to-be's thyroid and brain development and studies have shown that many American women arent getting enough of this essential mineral. Thats why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pregnant women take a daily supplement of iodine and cook with iodized salt for a total intake of 220 mcg per day. If the supplement youre considering doesnt have any (or enough) iodine, talk to your doctor about taking a separate iodine supplement.Vitamin B6: 1.9mg. This B vitamin helps decrease the potential for morning sickness  in fact, prescription morning sickness drugs are a combination of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and doxylamine (an antihistamine).Omega 3 fatty acids: Talk to your doctor. Regular prenatal vitamins dont contain omega-3 fatty acids  a healthy type of fat found in many types of fish. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to aid in babys brain development, both before and after birth. If youre unable to get the recommended two to three servings (8 to 12 ounces) of pregnancy-safe fatty fish per week, ask your doctor if you should take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement.A few other nutrients to be aware of:Vitamin A: No more than 10,000 IU. More can be toxic. Look for beta-carotene, the safest source of vitamin A.Vitamin D: 600 IU. Your body needs vitamin D, in combination with calcium, to grow your babys bones and keep yours strong. If your doctor suspects you may not be getting enough vitamin D (a relatively common issue among women), he or she may screen your levels at your first prenatal checkup. If youre deficient, hell recommend that you take an additional supplement of 1,000 to 2,000 IU.Zinc: 11 mg. This mineral supports your immune system and healthy cell division. Copper: 0.9 mg. Your body uses this trace element to form blood cells as well as maintain nerve, bone and immune system health.Vitamin C: 85 mg. You can get plenty of this vitamin, which helps your body to absorb iron and supports your immune system, in your prenatal diet. More than 2,000 mg can be dangerous for your baby  so as always, dont take a supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin unless recommended by your doctor.Other: Most prenatals contain two to three times the dietary reference intake (DRI) for vitamin E (12 mg), thiamin (1.2mg), riboflavin (1.2 mg), niacin (14 mg) and vitamin B12 (2.2 mg)  and there are no known harmful effects from such doses. Some preparations also contain magnesium, fluoride, biotin, phosphorus, pantothenic acid, extra B6 (to combat queasiness) and/or ginger (ditto).If you're avegetarian or vegan during pregnancy, be sure to tell your doctor to ensure you're getting the right nutrients in your supplements.Look for an independent seal of approvalSeveral groups independently verify dietary supplements (including prenatal vitamins) using rigorous criteria. If youd like extra reassurance that your supplement meets high standards, look for seals from the following organizations:United States Pharmacopeia (USP)NSF InternationalConsumer LabHowever keep in mind that getting approval from one of these groups is a voluntary, not required, step for manufacturers. So if your prenatal vitamin isnt marked with one of these seals, it doesnt necessarily mean its not good. Bottom line: If youre at all concerned about the quality of the supplement youre taking, talk to your doctor. Figure out if you can stomach itOnce you choose your prenatal vitamin, you might find you have a tough time stomaching it. The most common reasons (and solutions):If you have trouble swallowing it, look for a pill with a slicker coating. You may want to consider a pill sans calcium, since they tend to be smaller (calcium takes up a lot of space  if you do, be sure to talk to your practitioner to be sure you get enough of this essential mineral in other ways). You might also want to try a chewable or liquid prenatal vitamin (though you may have to try a few to find one with a taste that works for you).If it makes you feel nauseous, try taking your vitamin with a meal or snack or right before you go to bed. Still having trouble? Try the above tips  or ask your doctor to recommend a different brand that you may be able to stomach better.If youve got constipation, diarrhea or gas, it could be the extra iron in your pill. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids, eat fiber-rich foods and include regular physical activity in your daily routine. If this doesnt relieve your stomach woes, talk to your doctor about alternatives (i.e., a supplement without iron, or a separate iron preparation that dissolves in the intestines rather than in the more sensitive stomach, or one that is slow-release).Dont Overdo ItMore isn't better when it comes to vitamins. So stick with the recommended dosage, and don't take other extra supplements unless your doctor recommends it. Check in with your practitioner, too, if you're taking herbal supplements; some herbs can be harmful when you're trying to conceive.Keep in mind that prenatal vitamins complement a healthy diet, but they dont replace it. That means its still vitally important to eat a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet throughout your pregnancy. Think of your prenatal vitamin as a backup  not the other way around.Updated 8/27/15"

Pumping at Work Doesn’t Have to “Suck”,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/first-year/what-pumping-taught-me,"I could not have prepared myself for the challenges that came withpumpingbreast milk while I was at work, away from my twin babies. I had thebest breast pump, a comfortable chair, a private room, and a supportive boss. But the stress and emotions I felt about the whole process proved most difficult. SEE ALSO:Pumping Breast Milk 101I had already been experiencing low milk supplyone breast produced much more milk than the other. This was worrisome because I had twins and needed as much milk as possible. I did all the things I could do to increase milk supply and did see small results. Still, pumping and seeing exactly what was in that bottle when I was finished was a stark reminder that it wasnt enough. I had to remind myself that breastfeeding didnt have to be all or nothing. This was the amount I was able to produce, and this is what I was going to feed my babies,along with supplementing. I learned I needed to make peace with that and to go easy on myself. This was just one of many challenges the kids and I would most certainly get through.  Doctors Who Treat Crohn's - Find Crohn's Doctors Near You Experiencing Crohn's Disease Symptoms? Take the First Step to Getting Relief.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Locate-Doctor   The growing doubt I felt about returning to work only made pumping worse. I had a job that I loved and worked with some of the smartest and most inspiring women, but I couldnt help but fear I was doing wrong by my children. I wanted to be with them, but the reality was that I had to work. So, I made it my mission to not torture myself with that decision, and to be the best working mom that I personally could be. And, for me, that meant continuing to pump at work and staying connected to my kids even when I was away from them. Even when hooked up to the pump with its low moan whirring sound and fluctuating pitch, I learned to stop paying attention to each drop filling the bottles and instead direct my thoughts to my babies. I replayed moments in my mind--like how the night before my son fell asleep at my breast while nursing or how my daughter scooted across the floor backwards with the sweetest grin on her face. These moments, even when I was away from my kids, were still about them. And focusing on them helped me to relax, destress, and find peace so that I could produce as much milk as possible.The more I pumped at work, the more it became second nature to me. (Okay, well, not that having a battery-operated device strapped to my chest was ever truly second nature, but the act of it became easier, more comfortable.) Id think about my babies, send a text to our sitter to see how they were doing, look at photos of them I recently took, and even found some time to work. I got into a rhythm with my breast pump, mastering a multi-tasking racket of responding to work emails, while still having a piece of my mind and heart on my kids. Its kind of what happens when we enter the motherhood. We learn to juggle so many things at once and somehow, eventually, we get it all done.MORE:Tips for Pumping Breast MilkPumping, like so many parts of being a mom, teaches us acceptance. We learn what we can or cannot do and work around it, figuring out ways to make our lives the best they can be without getting down about the things we cannot change.

Italian Parents Could Land in Jail for Raising Their Kids Vegan,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/italian-parents-could-land-in-jail-for-raising-their-kids-vegan,"As if it isnt hard enough to feed your kids, what with picky eating and all, a member of the Italian parliament is raising the stakes. Elivira Savino wants to make it illegal for parents to raise their kids vegan. Her proposed law would put parents at risk of jail time for feeding their kids ""a diet devoid of elements essential for healthy and balanced growth,"" which Savino says can include veganism.Savino, who eats meat but not too much, proposed the law, which applies to parents of kids under 16 years old. If passed, parents could be put in jail for up to one year for simply feeding their kids a vegan diet, up to four years if the child develops permanent health problems, and up to seven years if the child dies from nutritional complications. Penalties would be more severe for parents of vegan kids under 3.""I have nothing against vegans or veganism as long as it is a free choice by adults,"" Savinotold Reuters. ""I just find it absurd that some parents are allowed to impose their will on children in an almost fanatical, religious way, often without proper scientific knowledge or medical consultation. Do-it-yourself on these matters terrorizes me.""Salvino said she devised this law following an incident last month in Milan, when a 1-year-old boy was hospitalized for weighing the same amount as the average 3 month-old because, doctors said, he was fed a vegan diet. According to an Italian newspaper, it was the fourth hospitalization of a vegan child in the country within 18 months.The Salvinos proposed law is expected to be brought to Italys parliament floor for debate this year.How you choose to feed your child can be a complicated and very personal choice, and adding potential jailtime into the mix doesn't make it any easier. Still, Savino does make at least the semblance of a valid point: When you make any big nutritional decision, consult your childs doctor. And certainly if your choices mean that your baby is failing to thrive, as in the recent case of the 1-year-old Milanese boy, you should be held responsible. But to punish attentive parents for a personal decision seems like a classic case of (yes, maybe well-intentioned) government stepping into matters where it doesnt have a right or even the expertise to be.So is it safe to raise your child vegan? Yes, say expertsprovided youre extra careful with your food choices and plan meals with the help of your child's pediatrician. And follow the guidelines for vegan toddlers, including:Breastfeeding baby for at least the first 12 months of life, exclusively for the first 6Serving only whole (not refined) grainsServing tofu, beans and other veggie protein sources, and healthy fats, like avocadoes as well asOffering vitamin supplements in consultation with your doctor, if necessaryKeeping an eye on babys weight, and offer more calories if shes not gaining enough"

Vegan Toddler Hospitalized Because Parents Ignored This Rule of Kids and Alternative Diets,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/toddler/0711/vegan-toddler-hospitalized-because-his-parents-didnt-know-this-about-alternative-diets,"A 14-month-old Italian boy, whose parents kept him on a vegan diet, was hospitalized earlier this month with severe malnutrition. He weighed only 5 kg, or 11 lbs, the same as an average 3 month-old.The boy, living in Milan with his mom and dad, was not given any dietary supplements, which lowered his calcium levels to ""the minimum needed to survive,"" Italian paper The Local reports, and aggravated a heart condition (not caused by his diet) to the point that he required emergency surgery. He's recovering well.Following the surgery, hospital staff reported his condition to social services because they said his parents refused to give him a more complete diet even after doctors asked them to. A local court has placed him in the custody of the hospital until the investigation of his parents is complete.  Prescriptions for Crohn's - Prescription Treatment Option Get the Info to Help Discuss Crohn's Treatment Options with Your Doctor.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Prescription   If you and your toddler are vegetarian or vegan, this story probably pisses you off  and rightfully so. To some, these parents, along with several similar ones, will give meat- and meat-product-free families a bad rap.But the truth is plenty of parents raise healthy children with alternative diets because they take care to still meet all of their baby's nutritional needs. No one knows for sure what drove the parents of this little boy to make their dietary choices or exactly what they were feeding him, but it's clear they were not following guidelines and compromised his wellbeing as a result.""It is not a problem to choose different or unusual kinds of nutrition, and we certainly do not want to enter into a discussion of the merits of the decision,"" said Luca Bernardo, the hospital's pediatric director. ""But since birth, the baby should have had support in this case with calcium and iron.""So what are the recommendations for raising a child on a vegan diet?First, as long as his or her eating patterns are well-planned, know that veganism and vegetarianism are ""perfectly healthy for infants and toddlers,"" according to the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Just follow medical recommendations and consult with your pediatrician along the way.Next, doctors still recommend breast milk as the main (or only) source of nutrition for the first 6 months of baby's life. If you do not breastfeed, opt for iron-fortified formula, which comes in soy if you're vegan.When baby is 4 to 6 months or older, you can introduce solids in pretty much the same way you would for a non-vegan or -vegetarian child. Try tofu or beans instead of meat and soy yogurt and cheese.If you're vegan, you may want to consider breastfeeding for more than a year (the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization). Wean with soy-milk formula fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Don't use milk alternatives (soy, rice, almond) during baby's first year.The most important part of feeding your baby or toddler a vegan or vegetarian diet, which can have serious health consequences if ignored, is getting your children enough of the nutrients that normally come from meat and dairy. These are: Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Protein and Fiber.Although this story is heartbreaking and even infuriating to some, these parents do not represent all vegan or vegetarian parents or this lifestyle. Feed your child however you feel is best; just don't confuse your beliefs with their needs."

Gestational Diabetes During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/gestational-diabetes/,"Has your doctor diagnosed you with gestational diabetes (GD or GDM), a form of diabetes that appears only during pregnancy? While it might feel overwhelming at first, it turns out that this pregnancy complication is much more common than you might think. In fact, up to 9.2 percent of pregnant women have GD, according to a 2014 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Know that with careful monitoring and treatment, it can be managed, and you can have a safe and healthy pregnancy.READ MORE:What causes gestational diabetes?Who's most at risk?What are the symptoms?How is it diagnosed?What are the complications?How can you prevent gestational diabetes?How is it treated?What happens to mom and baby after birth?What causes gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes usually starts betweenweek 24andweek 28of pregnancy when hormones from the placenta block insulin  a hormone produced in the pancreas that regulates the body's metabolism of fats and carbs and helps the body turn sugar into energy  from doing its job and prevent the body from regulating the increased blood sugar of pregnancy effectively. This causes hyperglycemia (or high levels of sugar in the blood), which can damage the nerves, blood vessels and organs in your body.Whos most at risk for gestational diabetes?While researchers aren't certain why some women get gestational diabetes while others dont, they do know that you may be at an increased risk if:You are overweight. Having a BMI of 30 or more going into pregnancy is oneof the most common risk factors for gestational diabetes because the extra weight affects insulin's ability to properly keep blood sugar levels in check.You have a higher level of abdominal fat. Recent research published in the American Diabetes Association's journal Diabetes Care found that women who had higher levels of tummy fat in the first trimester of pregnancy may be more likely to be diagnosed with gestational diabeteslater.You are older.Doctors have noted that women over the age of 35 have a significantly higher risk of developing GD.You have a family history.If diabetes runs in the family, you may be more at risk of GD. Women who areAfrican-American, Hispanic, Asian or Native American are also statistically more likely to receive a GD diagnosis.You have a personal history of GD. If you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, research suggests you're more likely to have it again in a subsequent pregnancy.You received a pre-diabetes diagnosis.If yourblood sugar levels are slightly elevated before pregnancy, you may be at higher risk of GD.You have been put on bed rest.Some research has shown that because youre inactive on bed rest, youre more likely to put on more pregnancy weight and, therefore, more likely to develop GD.What are the symptoms of gestational diabetes?Most women with have gestational diabetes have no symptoms, though a few may experience:Unusual thirst.Frequent urination in large amounts (distinguished from the also frequent but usually light urination of early pregnancy).Fatigue (which may be difficult to differentiate from normal pregnancy fatigue).Sugar in the urine (detected at a routine practitioner visit).How is gestational diabetes diagnosed?Youve probably noticed by now that your doctor asks for a urine sample at every office visit. Thats in part to check for sugar in your urine, which can be a sign of gestational diabetes (though one positive screening doesnt necessarily mean you have GD).In addition, the U.S. government now recommends that all pregnant women be screened specifically for gestational diabetes. Around week 28 of pregnancy, your practitioner will give you a glucose screening test, where you'll drink a sugary liquid and have your blood drawn an hour later. If your bloodwork picks up high sugar levels, your doctor will have you take a three-hour glucose tolerance test to determine whether you have gestational diabetes.How does gestational diabetes affect me and my baby?With proper treatment and regular monitoring by your practitioner, gestational diabetes can be managed and is not harmful to either you or your baby. But if excessive sugar is allowed to circulate in a mother's blood and then enter the fetal circulation through the placenta, the potential problems for both mother and baby are serious. Women who have uncontrolled GD are at risk for having a too-large baby (a condition called macrosomia), making delivery more difficult and C-section more likely. They are also at risk for preeclampsia and stillbirth. And because gestational diabetes is considered a pregnancy complication, pregnant women who have it may be more likely to be induced since most doctors won't let their pregnancies progress past their due dates.Uncontrolled diabetes could also lead to potential problems for the baby after birth, such as jaundice, breathing difficulties and low blood sugar levels. Later in life, he or she may be at an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. But it's important to remember: These potential negative effects don't apply to moms who get the help they need to keep their blood sugar under control.What you can do to prevent gestational diabetes?If your only risk factors forgestational diabetes are a family history of the disease and/or advanced maternal age, there may be nothing more you can do to prevent your chances of developing the condition. But if you're overweight, don't eat a well-balanced diet or don't routinely exercise, adopting a few healthy habits can make a big difference. And with enough repetition, they'll eventually require less conscious effort to maintain. The following steps can have a big impact on reducing your risk of developing both gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes, both before you conceive and during your pregnancy:Stay active. Working out under the guidance of your practitioner  even starting with just a 15-minute walk after lunch and dinner  allows your body to burn glucose even without the insulin your body should normally produce. Its a great way to keep your blood sugars in check, and youll probably love the way you feel once you get motivated to move.Eat a healthy diet. Making changes to your diet now not only protects you and your baby during pregnancy, it also helps you to develop better eating habits for life. Consume a well-balanced diet loaded with a variety of fruits and vegetables; lean, healthy protein; and complex carbs. Also, aim to limit your fat intake to 30 percent of your total daily calories, and try to avoid sugary, processed foods. Think high-fiber, low-fat options (whole grains, low-fat dairy, meat, legumes and fish), and watch your portions. Check out ChooseMyPlate.gov for more information on how much you should aim to eat from each food group and what constitutes a portion. While it takes a bit of work at first, it can quickly become routine  and youll soon be an expert on what to eat (and what to avoid).Keep an eye on the scale. With the help of your practitioner, try to maintain a normal weight and BMI: That means aim to gain the right amount of weight during pregnancy and lose the extra pounds after.How is gestational diabetes treated?Fortunately, virtually all of the potential risks associated with diabetes in pregnancy can be eliminated by carefully controlling your blood sugar levels. If youre diagnosed with GD, doctors and researchers recommend the following:Monitor your blood sugar level several times a day. Check first thing in the morning to get your fasting rate and then an hour after you eat each meal to make sure your blood sugar stays in a healthy range (suggested by your doctor). Most doctors suggest that you buy a diabetes kit, which includes needles to prick your finger and a little machine that reads your blood sugar. Dont worry, the finger prick doesnt hurt, and its the most accurate way to tell how your body is processing various foods. Its empowering when you make healthy food choices and your blood sugar reading is good  youre taking an active role in your own health (and, of course, your childs).Meet with a dietitian. She can help you review healthy food options and make a meal plan. Many women stick to their gestational diabetes diet of well-balanced meals long after birth.Keep a food log. After each meal, write down everything you ate along with your blood glucose number. This helps you to better understand what foods are spiking your glucose levels so you can avoid them.Get moving. Go for a walk or take the stairs after a meal to lower your glucose levels.Diet and exercise are often enough to control gestational diabetes  but if they dont, your doctor may suggest that you take supplementary insulin to control it. It can be given in shots, though the oral drug glyburide (a diabetes medication that helps the pancreas produce insulin) is being prescribed more and more often for GD.Your doctor may suggest additional fetal monitoring in your third trimester, including nonstress tests, to make sure your babys heart rate and movements are normal.What happens to you after pregnancy?Research has shown that women with gestational diabetes have a 50 percent chance of developing type 2 diabetes  which is why its so important to make those healthy habits routine during pregnancy and keep a check on your health even after your pregnancy is over. Here are a few ways to stay healthy post-birth:Keep up with doctor visits. Make sure your primary care physician and/or OB-GYN reevaluates you after your postpartum visit  at six weeks and then again every year  to check for continued problems with glucose and HgbA1C (glycated hemoglobin) levels.Talk to a nutritionist. Shell help you to develop a diet you can maintain that will help to control your glucose levels.Continue to aim to eat healthy every day. Try to avoid sugars and refined carbohydrates that spike your blood sugar and can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. Remember, sugar and simple carbs are everywhere  so make sure to read labels carefully (a nutritionist can help you to understand key ingredients to watch out for). Instead, opt for unprocessed foods like vegetables, low-fat meats, dairy and whole grains.Breastfeed for as long as possible. Breastfeeding has been found to decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes after GD. That's because breastfeeding improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, cutting the risk of developing diabetes down the road by half  and the longer you breastfeed, the lower your risk becomes.Fit in fitness. Although its hard to stay active with a baby who requires all of your attention (and more!), try to fit in as much doctor-approved exercise as possible to help you lose the pregnancy pounds and keep your weight in check.What happens to your baby after birth?Babies who are born to mothers with gestational diabetes should be tested for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), even if they have no symptoms, with a simple blood test after birth. This happens immediately after delivery, while you and baby are still in the hospital.After birth, its essential to keep the focus you had during pregnancy on a healthy lifestyle for your whole family  you may find that it helps you stick to your resolutions as well. Teach your child good eating and exercise habits early on: A recent study showed that children born to women with gestational diabetes were six times more likely to develop either diabetes or pre-diabetes compared to those kids born to moms who did not have this condition. To help avoid a type 2 diabetes diagnosis for your child, aim to ensure that he:Eats nutritious meals both as a baby and when he gets older. The same diet you follow during pregnancy and beyond is good for your child, too. When he gets old enough, have him help you in the kitchen  children who help prepare dishes are more likely to eat them.Gets plenty of exercise as he grows. Start by taking walks. As he gets older, toddler soccer and other activities are a great way to get him interested in healthy movement.Maintains a healthy weight. Talk to his pediatrician to make sure his BMI is on target, and talk openly to him about healthy weight and the increase in obesity he might notice in American schools.Updated 2/21/17Related Stories:Gestational Diabetes Menu PlanEating Well with Gestational DiabetesGlucose Tolerance Test"

SPONSORED: 4 Ways to Help Baby Sleep Well Through the Night,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ways-to-help-baby-sleep-well-through-the-night/,"Paid for and provided by PampersBefore you brought your baby home, you may not have realized just how much you love sleep. Your baby, on the other hand? Well, lets just say that he or she would rather do anything than rest those weary eyes at night. How can you help your baby learn to look forward to sleepingand stay asleep? Try these helpful strategies.Create a Bedtime RoutineDont expect it to run like clockwork at first, but establishing a calming and consistent bedtime routine can set the stage in the long run for encouraging your baby to slip smoothly into dreamland. Once you learn to anticipate when he or she is naturally tired (but ideally not overtired), put aside 20 minutes for a soothing bath, final feeding, gentle rocking and a lullaby.Dress Baby for ComfortWith all those adorable prints and super-snuggly materials, babys sleepytime wardrobe can make you wish you were a wee thing again yourself. What your baby wears to bed should first and foremost be functional, comfortable and safeinside and out.Start with a fresh diaper, like Pampers, that is absorbent to keep baby dry, and stretchy to provide a snug, comfortable fit. Avoid overdressing baby (no hats or extra clothing), and keep baby warm and cozy in a sleep sack thats the right size to allow baby to flex her elbows and knees. Prep for a Safe SnoozeOnce your baby goes down, you will finally have some me time (youve earned it, mama!). Enjoy these precious and restorative moments worry-free by making certain babys sleeping area adheres to safety standards. The mattress baby rests on should be clean and firmand fit tightly within his or her bed. The sheet you use to cover the mattress should also fit securely. Any fluffy bedding, blankets, pillows, wedges, sleep positioners, bumper pads, stuffed animals or toys should be left out of the space. And always put baby to sleep on his or her back. If youre swaddling, make sure the blanket is not wrapped too tightly around babys hips, and stop swaddling before baby begins trying to roll over on her own (around two months is a good cut off time).Eliminate Slumber BustersNow that baby is catching those zzzzs, make it last. While there are slumber busters youll never be able to controlteething and colds as a startthere are others you can anticipate.Keep babys room at a comfortable temperature, making sure its well-ventilated and cool.Never smoke in your babys room; in fact, smoking should never happen anywhere near your baby.Keep the noise level at a minimum. Complete and total silence isnt goldenafter all, your newborn is accustomed to your stomachs gurgles and the beat of your heart. But some soft background soundslow music, the hum of a fan or a white noise machinecan work wonders for sustaining sleep, especially if you live in a loud setting. Just be sure to place any noise generating machine at least 6 feet away from babys bed and keep it on the lowest setting.Finally, keep the lights dimand consider adding blackout shades to prevent the early morning sun from waking baby up before theyve gotten their needed amount of shut-eye.This content is provided by and paid for by our advertising partner."

Eating Well in the First Trimester,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well-menu/first-trimester.aspx,"Between early pregnancy nausea, food aversions, and fatigue, eating may be the last thing on your mind these days. Fortunately, you dont have to worry too much about eating or gaining weight in the first trimester, when the baby's needs are still very tiny.

Work from home? Co-sleep? Home-school? Well, there's a stranger out there who's just dying to tell you your opinion is wrong - even if the opinion in question is who you are as a parent.It's an all-too-common struggle that mommy blogger Constance Hall perfectly captured with a recent post describing a conversation she had with a father she met. Stay-at-home moms especially will recognize it.First he calls her a ""stay-at-home mum,"" and she cleverly explains that she doesn't like the term because she does much more with her kids than stay home and ""mum"" all day. After all, he doesn't go by ""cafe-owning dad,"" so why should parenthood steal her identity and not his?

Those “Well-Meaning” Comments About Pregnant Bodies,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/well-meaning-comments-about-pregnant-bodies,"Everyone knows that if you get a kick out of watching strangers (and sometimes even casual acquaintances) say dumb things and make complete fools of themselves, then you should definitely get pregnant. Because this happens to pregnant women all the time.Theres just something about bringing new life into the world that attracts ridiculous comments  you know what Im talking about. Things like, Are you sure it isnt twins? Or, Wow! Are you due tomorrow? Or, Should you be drinking a fourth whiskey cocktail in your condition? (Jokes, friends! No one is drinking whiskey cocktails, or alcoholic cocktails of any kind for that matter, because drinking alcohol is not recommended during pregnancy.)SEE ALSO: How Much Weight You Should Gain During Pregnancy  Talking about Crohn's - Get A Doctor Discussion Guide Experiencing Crohn's Symptoms? Get Info on Discussing it with Your Dr.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Talk   So, yeah, the rude comments can be annoying. But then there are those other comments  comments that most likely are well-meaning and coming from a good place but still make a pregnant woman go from being friendly and confident to paranoid and self-conscious in a hot second. Especially if shes overtired or having a particularly huge day, then a perfectly innocuous comment like the ones below can seem like a cruel insult, punishable only by mockery on the Internet.Here are some comments that seem benign but may send a sensitive pregnant woman into a downward spiral in the blink of an eye. Proceed at your own risk!You dont look pregnant  just like you had a really big lunch. Many a loving partner has uttered this very statement, intending it as a compliment. But guess what: Human babies are beautiful; burrito babies are not. A simple, You look great, sweetie! would be much more appreciated. Better yet, just be quiet and buy her lunch.Alternatively Wow, you really popped! What seems sudden and dramatic and worthy of enthusiastic statements that end in an exclamation point to you might not go over so well with a pregnant woman who has been uncomfortable for months (and may still have a few to go). Plus, popped? Really? Its a womans stomach, not bubble wrap. Surely there are other, more gentle verbs.Are you pregnant? I know the overly curious barista who asked me this the other day was just being friendly. (OK, fine. He wasnt the barista. He works at the gelato shop...and, yes, I was eating gelato. Again. In the middle of winter. Judge away!) Still, this isnt always a harmless or comfortable question. Because what if the answer was no and my baby bump was really a gelato bump? Best to play it safe and wait until the pregnant woman shares her news with you.I cant believe youre still wearing heels. Do you covet my heels? In which case, yay! Or are you afraid Im going to tip over? Please clarify. Immediately!I can tell youre having a girl because youre big everywhere, not just in the stomach. Im sure of it! I know Im having a boy. I know this because my OB looked at the ultrasound and told me. But enough about the gender  would you say this bigness you speak of is more flabby big or a jiggle-y big?Your skin looks amazing! My friends and family know to tread lightly around me when it comes to comments about my pregnant belly. Lately, theyve been focused on my skin, which was flattering at first until I started wondering: Are they talking about my skin to draw attention away from my huge thighs? Whats so different about my skin? Was my skin bad before and thats why they are over-complimenting it now? (I will let you know the answers to all these pressing questions after I get back from the dermatologist tomorrow.)which just goes to show, friends: That almost every comment about the physical side of pregnancy can be misconstrued and misinterpreted given the right mood and circumstances.So whats really going on here  are there too many sensitive pregnant women, or too many people making dumb comments? I think both sides should share the responsibility. I, myself, am adding Chill out! to my to-do list (right below Invest in flats and Figure out gelatos guy work schedule in order to avoid any future interactions). Any fellow oversensitive pregnant moms are welcome to join me.MORE: 12 Best Foods to Eat When Youre PregnantIn the meantime, my advice to well-meaning but nave non-pregnant bystanders is this: Tell her shes beautiful, that youre excited for her, that you cant wait to meet her baby. But leave all discussion of body parts between the neck and the knees (or, in my case, anything except the eyebrows) completely out of it.What was the best compliment and the worst comment you got during pregnancy?

Infant Shots: The 2 Month Well Visit,http://www.whattoexpect.com/blogs/mylittlemonkeys/infant-shots-the-2-month-well-visit,"I *hate* the 2 month well visit. Absolutely, positively hate it. That first round of infant shots always breaks my heart. But, as a mom, I have to do what I feel is best for my babies.I am a mom who vaccinates. My kids have each had all of their infant shots exactly on schedule. All of them have done well with their shots. My oldest daughter had a reaction to her Kindergarten DPT shot, as did my son who turned 4 this summer. They both had the exact same reaction. The arm where they got the shot swelled up and became as hard as a rock. It turned out to be nothing in both of them, but it sure scared me to death!With the infant shots, though, my kids have really never had a problem. Sure, they all get a little cranky, but I really don't see that much of a difference. (Maybe I just have cranky kids!) Only a few times did they ever react to their infant shots by running a low grade fever.Parker had his two month appointment Tuesday. That 2 month visit brings on the first round of infant shots, and the first real torture for a mom. I have only ever had one doctor that would let me nurse the baby while they got their shots. I liked that so much better. With all 4 other kids, though, I have had to hold their arms while the nurse poked their legs. Each time, I put my head as close to their ear as I possibly can and whisper how much I love them, that it's going to be ok, that Mommy's here, or anything else I can think of as they stick those needles into my sweet baby.Parker did really well after his first round of infant shots. He came home and slept most of the day. No fussiness, no fever, no other reactions. Just a whole lot of sleep. Can't complain about that.Now, no more infant shots until 4 months old. I have 2 more months to prepare myself all over again."

Eating Well During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/landing.aspx,
Eating Well During Labor,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/week-40/eating-well.aspx,"To eat or not to eat? When it comes to labor, that is the question  and the answer depends on whom you're talking to. Although some practitioners still say no way to food once contractions begin, many others believe that eating's fine (especially in the early stages of labor, and often all the way through), as long as you're sticking with fluids and snacks instead of a steak dinner. (Not that you'd be much in the mood for meat once those stronger contractions kick in.)So poll your practitioner, and get his or her take on the labor eating debate. Chances are, your doctor will be on board with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines: it's okay for moms-to-be to drink clear liquids if they're having uncomplicated labors. But he or she may still draw the line at solid foods (like toast).Why the eating ban in the first place? It was based on the long-held theory that food in the digestive track might be aspirated if you need emergency anesthesia. But not only are you incredibly unlikely to need such anesthesia, but studies have shown the aspiration rate to be minuscule. Another reason why many practitioners are more likely to send their patients snacking during labor: Recent research has shown that labor is shorter  up to 45 to 90 minutes shorter  in women who are allowed eating privileges. After all, labor lives up to its name  it's hard work, and hard work requires fuel. Laboring on empty can make it tough to summon up the strength for those last pushes.ADVERTISINGIf your practitioner gives the thumbs-down to solids, consider offering up the evidence (including those ACOG guidelines) you've now collected and pleading your case (as in ""please let me eat! I promise I'll lay off the fries!""); but if your practitioner still says no, it's best to heed his or her advice at 40 weeks pregnant. (Of course, you can also eat something light at home before you head for the hospital.)If you do get the go-ahead on eating, think small, and if your practitioner has suggestions, try to stick with them. In general, light snacks can keep your energy up, and liquids will keep you hydrated. Stick withEating Well During Labor: Solid FoodsToast with jam: Bland but sustaining, it'll give you a good energy kick (choose whole-grain toast for an even longer-lasting one), without straining your digestive system. Skip the butter, though, and the peanut butter. You're going fat-free.Plain pasta: It's not the time to partake of a platterful of penne (especially not one tossed with Bolognese), but a small scoop of perfectly plain pasta can be precisely the bland snack you're looking for. Plus, it can be a good way to carbo-load for the athletic event of your life.Applesauce or Jell-O: There's always room for these  they go down easy, as well as offer the energy boost you'll need for those more-challenging delivery room moments.Popsicles or sorbet: Suck on these  they'll keep you hydrated, give you a little jolt of energy, and, if they're actually made with fruit, you'll be cramming in a few last-minute vitamins. (Hey, it's never too late for those!) Plus, they make better choices than ice cream (you don't want to be trying to digest fat or dairy right now).Eating Well During Labor: LiquidsClear Broth: Warm, easy to digest, and nutritious, consider chicken or vegetable broth for the laboring soul  and body. Homemade or low-sodium would be a better choice than high-sodium canned varieties (they'll leave you super thirsty).Beverages: No surprise that water is on the list of ACOG's approved-for-labor liquids, but so is fruit juice (without the pulp), carbonated beverages (like seltzer or Sprite) clear tea, black coffee, and sports drinks.Ice chips: Though long a staple on the delivery-room menu, ice chips may be going out of style (and supplanted by more tasty beverages). But if you're under a no-food restriction during labor, you'll be able to suck on ice  and a few icy chips will be just the refreshing ticket when those breathing exercises leave you parched. Put your coach in charge of being your Ice Man, and making sure they Cometh as needed. (If you're still at home, he'll need to crush his own  the hospital offers an endless supply, already crushed.)Even if you're really hungry (and chances are, eating won't be the first thing on your mind at that moment), resist the temptation to take a final drive through those golden arches on the way to the hospital. In fact, you'd be smart to avoid anything that's high in fat or fiber-stuffed  you don't want to be competing with your digestive tract for energy reserves while it struggles to break down that Big Mac or that tray of bran muffins (plus the last thing you'll need is heartburn or the runs  you'll have plenty of other challenges to keep you busy).And whether you can eat or not during labor, your coach definitely can  and should (don't want him fainting from hunger when you need him most). Remind him to have a meal before you head off to the hospital or birthing center (his mind's probably on your belly, not his)  and to pack a bunch of snacks to take along so that he won't have to leave your side when his stomach starts growling. (Nothing smelly though  you probably won't be very happy about breathing in the aroma of garlic potato chips, especially three hours after he's eaten them.)See more tips for eating well while pregnant."

Eating Well When You're Constipated,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well-menu/constipated.aspx,"Unfortunately, constipation often comes with the pregnant territory. But that doesnt mean you have to sit back (bloated) and accept it. Altering your diet and focusing on fiber can get your bowels moving again and have you feeling more comfortable in no time.

Eating Well When You're Overdue,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/eating-well/week-42/are-we-there-yet.aspx,"You've painted the nursery, stocked up on onesies, written thank-you notes for the shower gifts, and have a month's worth of dinners in the freezer. You're more than ready (make that over-ready) for your little one's arrival  even if he or she doesn't seem in the slightest hurry to arrive. And as you waddle over to the kitchen table to sit down for yet another meal, you're probably wondering where you'll be able to fit it  and whether you should even bother trying. Your baby has got to be finished growing by now  right? And besides, haven't you already socked away more than enough nutrients during the past 40 weeks? A whopping 350 servings of broccoli, 3,000 slices of whole wheat bread, and 40 cases of yogurt later, you certainly must have accumulated some kind of nutritional reserve you can rely on now. Would it really hurt if you cracked open the twin pack of Twinkies you've been saving instead of broiling that salmon fillet (serving 275), or tore into a bag of greasy chips instead of tearing lettuce into a salad bowl (number 527)? You've done your Pregnancy Diet time  can't you just punch off the clock while you're waiting for the contractions to kick in?Not so fast. You may be overdue  but you're still on duty. First thing to keep in mind at 42 weeks pregnant (as you return the Twinkies to the pantry and retrieve that bag of salad from the fridge) is that baby can't live off of nutritional fumes. He or she is still growing up a storm, and still needs that shipment of vitamins and minerals (some of which, such as C and D, can't even be stored in your body and have to be replenished daily). Second, that little brain's still developing  and developing at a fantastic clip. To fuel that brainpower, baby needs all the protein and omega-3s (those fatty acids found in the salmon you're about to broil) you can deliver. And third, baby aside (as if you could put baby aside), there's the matter of your nutritional needs. Remember (as if you could forget) that you're about to begin a physically grueling race to the finish (aka labor), and you'll need all the energy you can muster  energy that you'll get from continued healthy eating. Planning to breastfeed, too? Now's certainly not the time to start tapping into nutritional reserves you'll need once that milk-making factory begins production.Sure you can almost see that light at the end of the tunnel  but that doesn't mean you should put an end to your baby-focused diet (or throw your healthy eating habits into oncoming traffic). Keep eating for two, and concentrate on these last-minute nutritional needs:ADVERTISINGProtein. This power-packed nutrient provides energy to you and brain-building material to your baby  so keep protein by your side (and in your stomach) to the happy end. Not in a meat mood (or a fish one) now that you're bursting at the belly seams? Nibble the day away on lighter protein choices  some yogurt or cottage cheese at breakfast, some cheese at snack time. Or scramble some eggs, stir-fry some tofu, heat up a bowl of miso soup, or micro a veggie burger. Need a bowl of comfort? Quickly cook up some oatmeal or some quinoa, a protein-rich grain with a nutty flavor. (Get even more info on protein during pregnancy.)Iron. In case you haven't heard, labor takes endurance  and lots of it. To make sure you're the little laboring engine that could (and can), you'll need to make sure your iron intake is up to speed. (An iron deficiency can cause extra fatigue  something you won't want to take into the birthing room with you.) Keep looking for iron in red meat, beans, peas, dark-green leafy vegetables, iron-fortified cereals, dried fruits, nuts, and whole-wheat breads  and remember to take your iron foods (and your extra iron supplement, which you should still be taking) together with a vitamin C and calcium source for better absorption.DHA. Known in scientific circles as docosahexaenoic acid, DHA is an omega-3 that will give your baby's brain a boost  even this late in the game. A hearty DHA intake can also help prevent postpartum depression, another reason to keep this fabulous fat coming. Where can you find it? In all the usual suspects  from such fatty fish as wild salmon, sardines, and herring to DHA eggs. (Learn all about why this is such a good fat during pregnancy.) And don't quit your DHA habit once baby's in your arms instead of in your belly  especially if you'll be breastfeeding. (The DHA content of your little one's brain triples in the first three months of life.)See more tips for eating well while pregnant."
Eating Well to Fight Postpartum Fatigue,http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/week-2/postpartum-fatigue.aspx,"Feeling more like an old zombie than a new mom? Not surprising, given the hours you're keeping (24/7), the demands of baby care (and babies are notoriously demanding), and the fact that you're still recovering from the physical challenge of a lifetime (they dont call it labor for nothin). Maybe getting significantly more rest isn't in the cards until baby's sleeping through the night (which is why you should be napping when your baby naps, whenever possible). Meanwhile, you can pick yourself up by eating the right food after pregnancy. To fight postpartum fatigue, choose foods for long-term energy instead of the momentary rush, and you'll find yourself with more get-up-and-go when you need it the most (hello, 3 a.m. feeding). Here's how:In This Series first yearRecovering from Childbirth: Surviving Food in Hospitals first yearSafe Eating After Pregnancy - Hello Sushi! first yearToning Your Tummy: Four Ways to Tackle Belly Fat After... first yearSix Tips for Smart Snacking Postpartum first yearExercise After Baby - Getting Back in the Exercise Saddle first yearPostpartum Yoga for TwoGo for the slow burn with your food after pregnancy.Bank those energy fires with foods that burn slow and long. Best bets: complex carbs and protein, preferably eaten in combination. Try whole-wheat toast with peanut butter (nursing moms should check p.b. out with their practitioner if there's a family history of allergies), dried fruit and nuts, precut veggies or whole-wheat pita with bean dip, and lean deli-sliced turkey rolled up with a slice of low-fat cheese and served up with raw carrots to fight postpartum fatigue. Get more eating-well recipes.Just say no.So sweet but so cruel, caffeine and sugar pick you up just to drop you  hard  when you need the boost to get you over postpartum fatigue the most. To avoid that crash-and-burn effect, limit both. Start your day with a cup or two of coffee  but just say no to the third, fourth, and fifth. Instead of a Kit Kat, reach for a sweet that won't let you down 20 minutes later: a whole-grain muffin, munched on with string cheese for extra staying power, are better foods after pregnancy.Graze throughout the day on healthy foods after pregnancy.Take a hint from your baby  who's wise beyond his or her years when it comes to eating. Rather than taking a three-meal-a-day approach (or worse still, skipping two out of three), graze the day away baby-style. Eating five or six mini-meals a day will keep your blood sugar and energy levels on an even keel. Plus, since lighter meals are easier to process, they don't divert to your digestive system energy you desperately need to fight afternoon postpartum fatigue. Keep food after pregnancy snacks high in protein and complex carbs (best eaten in combo) at the ready wherever you are: low-fat cheese, hard-boiled eggs, trail mix, frozen grapes, raw veggies and hummus dip, fresh and dried fruit, soups (very sustaining when topped with a scoop of cottage cheese), and whole-grain crackers and cereal. For a quick meal-on-the-run (and when won't you be on the run?), stock up on sandwich wraps or whole-wheat tortillas, easily filled with roasted turkey or rotisserie chicken.Spend wisely.Let's face it  time isn't on your side these days. So rather than wasting it on repeated trips to the kitchen, keep the right foods where you're likely to grab them. Keep a small dish of walnuts and dried apricots next to the glider you nurse in, individual boxes or bags of cold cereal in your bed-stand drawer, an apple and a nutritious granola bar in your diaper bag. And for those times when you do find yourself in front of an open fridge, make sure that healthy snacks are within grabbing distance (including plenty of precut veggies, fruit salad, cheese, and hard-boiled eggs).Drink up.Dehydration can trigger exhaustion  and you have enough reasons to be tired already. Especially if you've recently delivered (you've lost lots of fluids during delivery and through postpartum sweating) and most especially if you're nursing, be sure to drink at least 64 ounces of water or other hydrating liquids a day. Is your urine dark, or scant? That's your body's way of cluing you in to dehydration  listen up and drink up.Limit alcohol.Even when you're well rested, alcohol has a tranquilizing effect. These days, that once-relaxing glass of wine may heighten your postpartum fatigue. A little goes a long way when you're sleep deprived, so drink alcohol sparingly, if at all. Something else to keep in mind before popping the cork or refilling your glass: Alcohol can put you to sleep, but can also wake you up in the middle of the night (and you already have someone doing that)."

The Secret to a Well-Adjusted Child?,http://www.whattoexpect.com/wom/pregnancy/0122/the-secret-to-a-well-adjusted-child-.aspx,"Summary: Co-parenting emphasizes you and your partner working together to raise your child, enforce the same rules, and dole out the same discipline. This, in turn, can help you feel supported as a new mom  and help you raise a happier child for years to come, finds a new study.Bringing a child into the world means lots of new and often complicated decisions for you and your partner: Natural birth or epidural? Go back to work or stay at home with the new baby? Co-sleep or crib? To prepare, you have no doubt spent time in birthing classes together to learn how to navigate the labor process. But have you thought about doing the same to prepare for parenting together? Learning how to parent cooperatively  or co-parent  with your partner won't just help you feel more supported and less stressed in your role as a new parent. It can also have lasting positive effects on your child's wellbeing, suggest new findings published in the Journal of Family Psychology.What exactly is co-parenting, anyway? In a nutshell, it's when parents actively work together to raise their child by agreeing on parenting strategies, then following through by supporting each other's efforts. The term is often used in relation to divorced couples, but it's equally applicable for married ones: When you co-parent, you and your partner work to emphasize the same family values to your child, enforce the same rules, and dole out the same discipline. You also collaborate to uphold day-to-day priorities that are important to you, whether it's reading with your child every night before bed or eating family dinners together.  Crohn's Prescription - Info On Prescription Treatment Learn about a Treatment Option. See What's Possible for Your Crohn's.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Prescribe   Study researchers assigned 163 married couples expecting the birth of their first child to participate in co-parenting classes or be part of a control group that did not participate in co-parenting classes. The eight-session co-parenting series was spread across the second and third trimesters as well as postpartum, and sought to equip moms- and dads-to-be with tools to help them co-parent effectively.Researchers continued to follow the new families until the children reached the age of 7. Parents regularly completed surveys pertaining to their child's behavior and development; as the children reached school age, their teachers rated the children on learning engagement and academic motivation. The findings might not surprise you: Children of parents who participated in co-parenting classes tended to be better adjusted socially and emotionally, both at home and at school.Couples who receive guidance in transitioning to parenthood seem to build stronger family relationships, which appear to have a long-term impact on how a child develops. Frequent fighting about parenting issues has been shown to have a negative impact on kids, experts say, because it makes them feel like they're in the middle, which can lead to guilt.The study looked specifically at a co-parenting program called Family Foundations. And though Family Foundations classes aren't currently available, there are plenty of co-parenting strategies that you and your partner can work on right at home, before and after the birth of your child:Agree upon rules and strategies ahead of time. Whether it's a baby sleep strategy, discipline tactics or TV rules for your toddler, make a list of a few hot-button parenting topics, ideally before baby arrives, and discuss them. Decide on a route together  and stick to it.Discuss shared expectations. What values and goals do you have for your child? See how they match up with your partner's expectations, and find a way to incorporate both.Keep it positive. When you and your partner disagree (and you will!), it's totally normal. But it's important to make a conscious effort to avoid undermining or putting down each other, especially in front of your child.Discuss differences. Talk about disagreements and come up with an action plan that presents a united front to your child.Photo Credit: Lea Csontos | Stocksy3 things to read next:Different Parenting Stylesand What Dads Can Teach MomsDid You Pick the Right Mate to Be Your Co-Parent?How Positive Parenting Can Work for Your Family"

Nausea and Morning Sickness During Pregnancy,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/morning-sickness/,"You're sailing along on your early pregnancy adventure at (so far, so good, you're thinking  just a touch of tenderness around the nipples, a little urinary frequency, a few blue veins across your chest, but nothing you can't handle). Until one day, you wake with a strangely icky feeling in the pit of your stomach. Could it be seasickness? Sure does feel like it (that, or the worst hangover you've ever had). Well, in these pregnant parts, it's called morning sicknessand chances are you'll be bunking with it for the next few weeks.Whats going on in there today? Download the What To Expect app for week-by-week updates, news, tips from experts and more!When does morning sickness start?If you're among the estimated three in four women who suffer from symptoms related to this misnamed malady in the first trimester of pregnancy, you already know the bad news: Although that nauseous, queasy feeling in your stomach often starts when the sun rises, it can hit at any time of the day or night. Also sometimes known as nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), symptoms typically start around week 4 to week 9 of pregnancy and peak somewhere between week 7 and week 12. And since that sense of smell is extra-keen in a newly pregnant woman, morning sickness causes many women have strong aversions to certain foods and smells, too.ADVERTISINGThe good news: For the vast majority of expectant moms, the worst of it is over between weeks 12 to 14 (though a few women continue to experience symptoms into the second trimester, and a very few, particularly those expecting multiples, may suffer some well into the third). Even better news: Though morning sickness might make you feel lousy, its not harming your baby.What causes morning sickness?No one knows for sure  though theres no shortage of theories. It could be triggered by the increased level of the pregnancy hormone hCG (which peaks around the time morning sickness is worst). Rising levels of estrogen and progesterone levels relax the muscles of the digestive tract, making digestion less efficient. The rapid stretching of the uterine muscles likely doesnt help, nor do other body changes (such as that keener sense of smell or the metallic taste many women experience during pregnancy). Skipping meals can contribute to an empty and nauseous feeling as well.Causes of Morning Sickness:Hormone LevelsSensitivityStressFatigueFirst-time pregnancy statusGeneticsNot all pregnant women experience morning sickness  and not in the same way, either. Some have only occasionally queasy moments, others feel queasy round the clock but never vomit, others vomit once in a while, and still others vomit frequently. There are probably a few reasons for these variations:Hormone LevelsHigher-than-average levels (as when a woman is carrying multiples) can increase morning sickness; lower levels may minimize or eliminate it (though women with normal hormone levels may also experience little or no morning sickness).SensitivitySome brains have a nausea command post thats more sensitive than others, which means theyre more likely to respond to hormones and other triggers of pregnancy queasiness. If you have a sensitive command center (you always get carsick or seasick, for instance), youre more likely to have more severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Never have a queasy day ordinarily? Youre less likely to have lots of them when youre expecting.StressIts well known that emotional stress can trigger gastrointestinal upset, so its not surprising that symptoms of morning sickness tend to worsen when stress strikes.FatiguePhysical or mental fatigue can also exacerbate the symptoms of morning sickness (conversely, severe morning sickness can increase fatigue).First-time pregnancy statusMorning sickness is more common and tends to be more severe in first pregnancies, which supports the idea that both physical and emotional factors may be involved. Physically the novice pregnant body is less prepared for the onslaught of hormones and other changes its experiencing than one thats been there, done that. Emotionally, first timers are more likely to be subject to the kinds of anxieties and fears that can turn a stomach  while women in subsequent pregnancies may be distracted from their nausea by the demands of caring for older children. (Generalities never hold true for every expectant mom, though, and some women are queasier in subsequent pregnancies than they were in their first).GeneticsWomen whose mothers had morning sickness have been shown to be more likely to develop the condition themselves.What you need to knowIn the short term, not eating very much isn't a problem: Your baby is fortunately teeny tiny when morning sickness is at its worst and doesn't have very much in the way of nutritional needs yet. (By the time he or she does, you'll almost certainly have your appetite back, in spades!) Even women who have such a hard time keeping food down that they actually lose weight during the first trimester arent hurting their babies, as long as they make up for the lost weight in later months. Keep an eye on your urine, though: It should be clear or light colored, like straw, not dark (which is a sign to drink up).However if youre not able to keep anything down, including fluids, it may be a symptom of hyperemesis gravidarum, a more serious condition which affects up to 2 percent of women with morning sickness. If your nausea is continuous and severe and you vomit several times a day, make sure to see your doctor: You may require additional treatment to protect both you and your baby.What you can to ease morning sicknessDoesn't make you feel any better that you and most of your belly mates are all sailing the SS Queasy together (especially as your head is busy bobbing in the toilet)? Maybe the following nausea-nipping tips will:Stick to foods that appeal, for now. Even if it's the same foods over and over and over again. Avoid eating (or seeing, or smelling, or even thinking about) any dishes that trigger the queasies (spicy and acidic foods may be particularly challenging, as well as anything with a strong aroma). Chances are you'll be able to find a few healthy foods that you can keep down (or at least contemplate coming fork-to-face with)  and that will take care of most of your nutritional requirements until a more varied diet becomes palatable. Choose only sweet foods if theyre all you can tolerate (get your vitamin A and protein from peaches and yogurt at dinner instead of broccoli and chicken). Or select only savories if theyre your ticket to a less tumultuous tummy (have reheated pizza for breakfast instead of cereal). Don't worry too much about getting your Daily Dozen in the short term, since your baby (and his or her needs) is pretty tiny now. And remember, no one food has a monopoly on any one nutrient  so if you turn green at the thought of anything green, get your vitamin fix from a sweet, juicy cantaloupe instead.Eat early Morning sickness doesnt wait for you to get up in the morning. In fact, nausea is most likely to strike when youre running on empty, as you are after a long nights sleep. Thats because when you havent eaten in a while, the acids churning around inside your empty tummy have nothing to digest but your stomach lining  which, not surprisingly, increases queasiness. To head off heaving, stock your nightstand full of trail mix, crackers, and cold cereal to munch on first thing in the morning. Its a good idea to even have a little nocturnal nibble if (or rather, when) you wake up in the middle of the night to pee.and right before bed. For the same reason, try eating a light snack high in protein and complex carbs (a banana muffin and a glass of milk, string cheese and a handful of dried apricots) just before you go to sleep to help ensure a happier tummy when you wake up.Be a grazer. The idea is to keep your belly a little bit filled all the time (don't overfill it, and don't let it get completely empty). Eat six to eight small meals throughout the day rather than three large squares  again, when your tummy's empty, youre more likely to feel nauesous. Plus, smaller meals are easier to digest  and less likely to trigger the queasies (or to overflow via vomiting). And dont leave your house without a stash of snacks that your tummy can handle (dried fruit and nuts, granola bars, dry cereal, crackers, soy chips or pretzels).Try the combo. No, not the double cheeseburger combo (that's the last thing you need right now)  the protein-and-complex-carbohydrate (dried apricots, crackers, dry whole-grain toast) pregnancy diet combo. Taken separately, these food groups are both good for baby. Taken together, they're good for baby  and keeping nausea at bay.Don't go overboard with fat. The more you steer clear of greasy foods, the happier your tummy will be. Not only are fats hard to digest, but they can send your nervous system into warp speed ahead, aggravating your nausea.Tread gingerly. It's true what the old wives (and midwives) have been saying for centuries: Ginger can be good for what ails a queasy pregnant woman. Its been shown in more than one scientific study to reduce nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. So stock up on staples such as ginger snaps, real ginger ale, ginger tea, ginger candies, ginger biscuits, crystallized ginger or ginger drinks. Use ginger when youre cooking (ginger carrot soup, ginger muffins), and infuse your tea with it. Even the smell of fresh ginger (cut open a knob and take a whiff) may quell the queasies. It'll help put a damper on nausea.When life gives you morning sickness, make lemonade. Another trick of the queasy trade: lemons. Many women find the smell  and taste  of lemons comforting. Sour sucking candies or a sniff of freshly-cut lemon may be your ticket to relief.Switch off. Often, what starts out as a comfort food (its the only thing you can keep down, so you eat it 24/7) becomes associated with nausea  and actually starts to trigger it. If youre so sick of crackers that theyre actually beginning to make you sick, switch off to another comforting carb (maybe itll be Cheerios or watermelon next).Drink up. Making sure you get your eight glasses of fluid a day is especially crucial if vomiting is leaving you high, dry, and dehydrated. Cant stand water? Try sucking on Popsicles. Some women find that drinking and eating at the same sitting puts too much strain on their digestive tract; if this is true for you, try taking fluids between meals. If youre finding liquids are easier to get down when youre green, drink your vitamins and nutrients with soups, smoothies and shakes (many women find icy cold fluids and foods are easier to get down, too).Smell (and see) no evil. Thanks to a much more sensitive sense of smell, pregnant women often find once appetizing aromas suddenly offensive  and offensive ones downright sickening. So stay away from smells that trigger nausea  whether its the sausage and eggs your spouse likes to make on the weekends or the aftershave of his that used to make you head over heels (but now makes you head for the toilet). Steer clear, too, of foods that you cant stand the sight of (raw chicken is a common culprit).Supplement. Take your prenatal vitamin to compensate for nutrients you may not be getting, at whatever time of day youre least likely to cuck it back up. Make sure it's iron-free, at least until the morning sickness during pregnancy passes. Take it with a meal, and consider a coated, powder or chewable one, which may agree with your stomach more. Afraid that vitamins will only make matters worse  besides being hard to choke down? Actually, that one-a-day can decrease nausea symptoms (especially if you take a slow-release vitamin thats higher in quease-combatting vitamin B6). If your symptoms are particularly rough, ask your practitioner about taking a vitamin B6 supplement.Try Sea-bands. These 1-inch wide bands worn on both arms put pressure on acupressure points in the inner wrist. They cause no side effects and are widely available at drug and health food stores and have been shown to lessen pregnancy nausea.Take time to relax. Try any of the classic stress-reduction techniques, like meditation and visualization or prenatal yoga. And as always, hit the sack for as many hours as you can clock every night.Use complimentary approaches. There are a wide variety of complementary medical approaches, such as acupuncture, acupressure, biofeedback or hypnosis, that can help minimize the symptoms of morning sickness  and theyre all worth a try.Treat your mouth well. Brush your teeth or rinse your mouth after bouts of vomiting if you can stomach it when your tummy has settled a bit, as well as after each meal. (Ask your dentist to recommend a good rinse, or use plain water; you can also brush your teeth with water or a milder tasting toothpaste if your usual brand is contributing to the nausea.) Not only will this help keep your mouth fresh and reduce queasiness in the future, it will decrease the risk of damage to teeth that can occur when bacteria feast on regurgitated residue in your mouth.Ask your doctor about medication. If your morning sickness is severe, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking an FDA-approved drug to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. You'll likely be prescribed two tablets daily at bedtime, and if your symptoms are not mitigated, your dose can be increased to a maximum of four tablets daily with the approval of your doctor. Dont take any medication (traditional or herbal) for morning sickness unless its prescribed by your practitioner.Updated 8/17/20163 Things to Read Next:Eating Well When You're Too Nauseated to EatDealing with Loss of Appetite During PregnancyEarly Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy"

Flu During Pregnancy: What You Need to Know to Stay Safe,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/flu-during-pregnancy/,"When youre expecting, your body suppresses your immune system in order to support your baby  leaving you more susceptible than usual to viruses. That means youre more likely to get sick with a cold, flu or other illness while youre pregnant. The flu, which most often announces itself with body aches, fever and/or chills, can be dangerous for pregnant women, potentially leading to serious complications requiring hospitalization. Thats why its so important that all expectant moms get a flu vaccine before flu season arrives.Whether youve already caught the flu or are deciding whether you need to get immunized against it, heres what you need to know to protect yourself and your baby.What causes the flu during pregnancy?Cases of the flu are caused by influenza viruses. Because the influenza virus is constantly mutating, there are an unlimited number of flu viruses  which also explains why the flu vaccine is different each year (and why even if youve had the shot in the past, you need to get a new one each flu season).ADVERTISINGWhat are the symptoms of the flu?Influenza (aka the flu) is more severe and comes on more suddenly than a cold. Symptoms include:Fever (usually 102F to 104F or higher)HeadacheChillsA sore throat that generally worsens by the second or third dayIntense muscle sorenessGeneral weakness and fatigueOccasional sneezingCough that can become severeHow long does the flu last?Symptoms of the flu typically last two weeks, though they can last longer.Can the flu be dangerous during pregnancy? Being pregnant definitely puts you at greater risk for the flu's more serious complications, like pneumonia. In fact, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized from complications of the flu than non-pregnant women of the same age (which is why getting the flu shot as a preventative measure is such a good idea).Can having the flu during pregnancy harm my baby?But what happens if you didnt get the flu shot for some reason and then you do end up getting the flu? Here are some worries you may have:Miscarriage. The flu is unlikely to increase your risk for miscarriage: Your body is programmed to protect your baby-to-be, even when youre feeling miserable. That said, having a high fever does increase the risk of miscarriage and other complications.Autism or other developmental disorders. Though you may have heard about some research that found a slightly higher risk of autism in children whose moms had the flu during pregnancy, its unlikely that the flu itself is the contributory factor to the increased risk. Most experts agree that a high fever is more likely the cause.Preterm birth. There appears to be a slightly higher risk of premature labor and preterm birth in women who have an untreated case of the flu during pregnancy.Birth defects. High fevers during the first trimester have been linked to birth defects in the baby.As you can see, all of the above are reasons why its so important to treat any fever as recommended by your practitioner (whether you have the flu or another infection).Can I get the flu shot during pregnancy? Yes, it's safe to get the flu shot during pregnancy. In fact, you definitely should get it: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all moms-to-be get the flu shot to keep safe during flu season. As an added bonus, getting immunized during the last trimester of pregnancy not only protects you, but it also helps protect your baby from the flu until hes old enough for a flu shot himself.The flu vaccine offers the most protection if its given before flu season or early on during it (preferably by October). Its never 100 percent effective because it protects only against the influenza viruses that are expected to cause the most problems in a particular year. Still, it greatly increases the chance that youll escape the season flu-free.Keep in mind that the nasal spray vaccine (FluMist, which is made from live flu virus), is not approved for or given to pregnant women, so youll have to stick with the needle version during pregnancy.What happens if I get the flu while pregnant?The same tips that can help keep you comfortable when youve got a cold can also be used when youre down with a bout of the flu. They include:Resting when you feel fatiguedEating well: Focus on eating lots of vitamin C foods (kiwis, pineapple, oranges, grapefruit, blackberries, raspberries, tomatoes, edamame, kale, broccoli and spinach) and foods that are high in zinc (lean red meat, skinless chicken breast, eggs, chickpeas, lentils, black beans, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, kale, garlic and pumpkin seeds) to help boost your immune systemTaking your prenatal vitamin, which offers a pregnancy-safe dose of vitamin C and zinc in addition to the folate, calcium and other nutrients you and your baby needDrinking plenty of fluids to soothe your sore throat and replace whats lost by feverHaving a couple spoonfuls of honey, which can be soothing and actually help suppress a cough as well as an OTC cough suppressantSince a fever can be dangerous for you and your unborn baby, youll need to take steps to reduce it:Take a fever-reducing medication (acetaminophen  a.k.a. Tylenol  is the safest bet; see below for the medications you should avoid)Try a tepid bath or showerDrink plenty of cool beveragesKeep clothing and bed covers lightRemember, too, that if you're suffering from flu symptoms, it's important to call your practitioner. Because the flu can be serious in pregnant women, your practitioner will probably want to treat you with an antiviral mediation like Tamiflu. Antiviral medications work best if you take them within two days of getting sick. The sooner youre treated, the safer you and your baby will be.Safe medications for the flu during pregnancyWhile many of the medications you used to reach for before you became pregnant are off-limits now, there are still some meds that are safe to take to relieve symptoms of the flu during pregnancy:Antivirals. Tamiflu and other antivirals are safe (and important to take) if prescribed by a practitioner who has diagnosed you with the flu.Acetaminophen. If you're running a fever or suffering from nasty body aches or headaches, it's generally considered safe to take products containing acetaminophen, such as Tylenol.Cough remedies. Expectorants (like Mucinex) as well as cough suppressants (such as Robitussin or Vicks44) as well as most cough drops are considered safe during pregnancy, but ask your practitioner about dosing.Some nasal sprays. Most steroid-containing nasal sprays are fine to use during pregnancy, but check with your doctor about brands and dosing. Plain saline drops and sprays are always safe to take when you're expecting and can help clear and moisturize a stuffy nose.Some antihistamines. Benadryl and Claritin often get the green light during pregnancy, but be sure to check with your practitioner before taking them. Some doctors will advise staying away from those medications in the first trimester.Remember: Never take any medication (prescription, over the counter or homeopathic) without consulting with a doctor who knows youre expecting.And dont put off calling the doctor or refuse to take a medication she prescribes because you think all drugs are harmful in pregnancy. When it comes to the flu, the sooner youre treated, the safer you and your baby will be.Medications to avoid during pregnancySome of the medications that could help with flu symptoms when youre not pregnant are off-limits to moms-to-be because they may cause harm to their unborn baby. These include:Some pain relievers. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), or naproxen (Aleve) are off-limits during pregnancy because they can be harmful to mom and baby.Most decongestants. Decongestants like Claritin-D, Sudafed or DayQuil should be avoided when youre expecting (though those featuring phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine may be okay to take during pregnancy with your doctors approval). Even those experts who say its okay to take certain decongestants will caution that its only safe to use after the first trimester and only as long as its used in a limited amount.Some nasal sprays. Steer clear of nonsteroidal nasal decongestant sprays containing ozymetazoline (like Afrin) unless given the green light by your practitioner. Many will tell you to avoid these sprays completely while you're expecting, while others will advise only limited use (one or two days at a time) after the first trimester.Homeopathic remedies. Never take Echinacea or other supplements (like zinc and vitamin C) without medical approval.Updated 2/28/173 things to read next:Stuffy Nose During PregnancyStomach Bugs During PregnancyAllergies During Pregnancy"
Tips on Writing a Birth Plan,http://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/labor-and-delivery/birth-plan/,"By this point in your pregnancy you've spent a lot of time thinking about baby names, which brand of car seat to buy and whether you're going to stay home or go back to work after your sweet baby arrives. But have you given any thought to how you want your labor and delivery experience to go? This is the perfect time to create a birth plan. The big day will be here before you know it!What is a birth plan and what should it include?A birth plan is just that  a plan that communicates your wishes and goals for before, during, and after labor and delivery. In it, parents-to-be can offer up their best-case birthing scenario: how they'd ideally like labor and delivery to play out if all goes to ""plan."" Besides listing those preferences, the typical birth plan factors in what's practical, what's feasible, and what the practitioner and hospital or birthing center will accommodate (not everything on a birth plan may fly with them) or have available. Some practitioners routinely ask an expectant couple to fill out a birth plan, while others are happy to oblige if one is requested.Why create a birth plan?Not only can a good birth plan deliver a better birth experience, but it can also head off unrealistic expectations, minimize disappointment, and eliminate major conflict and miscommunication between a birth mom and her birth attendants. It's also a springboard for dialog between patient and practitioner. Not sure how yourpractitioner feels about some of your birth preferences? Now, well before labor starts, is the time to find out.What to keep in mind about birth plansA birth plan is a written understanding  not a binding contract  between you and your practitioner, and though chances are very good that your plan can be carried out just they way you drew it up, there's always the chance that it won't. For example, a birth plan you design ahead of time may not end up being medically advisable  or what works for you in the moment  and may have to be adjusted at the last minute for your baby'swell being and yours. Or, a change of mind (yours) can also prompt a change of plan (you were dead set against having an epidural, but somewhere around 5 cm, you become dead set on having one). That's why the most important part of a good birth plan is flexibility. Childbirth is unpredictable: The best-laid plans don't always go, well, according to plan.Your birth plan checklistThere's no right or wrong way to write a birth plan. Some birth plans cover just the basics, while others are extremely detailed. And because every expectant woman is different  not only in what she'd like out of the birth experience but what she can likely expect given her particular pregnancy profile and history  a birth plan should be individualized.If you're wondering what you should include in your personalized plan, use the following four areas as a guide:Requests before birthRequests during labor and deliveryVaginal vs. C-section birth preferencesRequests for newborn careRequests before birthWhat do you want the atmosphere where you give birth to be like? List your desires, remembering that not all choices may be permitted. Some issues or scenarios you may want to tackle include:Who you'd like to have with you (besides your partner) during labor and/or at delivery  including a doula, your other children, friends, familyEating or drinking during active laborBeing out of bed (walking around or sitting up) during laborBeing in a tub for labor and/or birthPersonalizing the atmosphere with music, lighting, items from homeTaking photos or videosWhat equipment  exercise ball, in-room shower, birthing tub  you may want available to you (permitting your chosen facility can accommodate your request) for use in active laborSpecific birthing positions you'd like your practitioner to support you inRequests during labor and deliveryThis is where you can be clear about how you want to labor, the manner in which you will manage labor pain, and what labor procedures you are comfortable with. Issues or scenarios you may want to address are:The type of birth you're planningThe use of an epidural or other pain medication  or wishes about alternatives to pain medsArtificial rupture of the membranes and/or leaving membranes intactExternal and internal fetal monitoringThe use of an IV or catheterThe use of oxytocin to induce or augment contractionsYour practitioner's position on episiotomies vs. natural tearingThe use of interventions like forceps or vacuum extraction to assist in the birth of your childVaginal delivery vs. C-section preferencesEven if you know you don't want a medical induction or C-section, it's important to prepare for unexpected events by listing your preferences regarding those processes. However, know that your health care provider may advise against some of your preferences, especially if you are high risk or experience a medical emergency during labor and delivery. Requests for newborn careHow do you want the moments after your baby's birth to unfold? Use this part of your birth plan to share your expectations of care for both you and your baby during recovery. Here are some issues and scenarios to consider:Special requests around suctioning baby, such as suctioning by the fatherHolding the baby immediately after birth, allowing baby time to creep from belly to breastPlans for breastfeeding immediately, having a lactation consultant there to helpWhen to cut the cord, and cord blood bankingHaving your partner catch the baby and/or cut the cordPostponing weighing the baby and/or administering eye drops until after you and your baby greet each otherSpecial requests around the placentaExample birth plan templatesIf you're still unsure about what should go in your birth plan or feeling overwhelmed by all the decisions surrounding your baby's birth, don't worry: There's plenty of online resources to help. You can download a customizable, extensive birth plan template to print out and fill in based on your responses to the options listed above (and perhaps those not addressed). My Birth Plan and Earth Mama are good places to start.Once you've finished, print out that first version of your birth plan and take it to your next practitioner visit as a means for opening up discussion. After you talk about your preferences for your childbirth experience with your practitioner, listen to what he or she has to say about your labor options. If there are any changes you need to make, update your birth plan. Make several copies of your health care provider-approved birth plan and have them available for the labor and delivery nursing team, as well as the post-birth nursing team.Bottom line: Birth plans, though by no means necessary, are a great option, one that more and more expectant parents are taking advantage of. To figure out whether a birth plan is right for you and what should be in it, talk it over with your practitioner at your next visit.3 Things to Read Next:What Really Happens During LaborNatural Ways to Induce LaborVideo: Packing Your Hospital Bag"
"Baby's Name Might ""Shape"" Baby's Face, New Research Finds",http://www.whattoexpect.com/news/pregnancy/baby-name-might-shape-face-study-finds/,"As if the pressure to name your baby isnt enough between fearing your mother-in-laws reaction to picking a name you and your partner can just finally agree on. Oh, and then theres the fact that your child will go by that name forwellforever. But now, a new study adds more pressure to the mix: People might actually conform their facial features to fit the stereotypes of their birth name. Now naming your baby is really NBD because shell grow into it, eventually. Right?What the study looked atFrench and Israeli researchers hypothesized that a name impacts not only how a person is perceived, but that people adapt their facial features to fit the look of that name what they call a Dorian Gray effect. In other words, a person is treated a certain way because of their given name, and they begin to conform their facial expressions to that treatment. Put another way, a name can actually ""shape"" a person's face.The resulting set of eight studies, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, looked to test the relationship between a persons name and appearance. In six of the studies, the researchers tested how well people in France and Israel could match up a photo of a face to a name. In two other studies, a computer analyzed several thousand photos of people and their names and had to perform that same photo-name matching task.

See What's Possible Today.  www.CrohnsTreatment.com/Discuss-Crohns   What researchers foundIn one of the experiments, participants were able to accurately pair one of five names to a face 35 percent of the time. Thats significantly more often than the 20 percent odds theyd have of making the match at random. The trained computers were also more accurate at matching up names to faces. In fact, by looking for similarities around a persons eyes or mouth the areas of our face we can change the most using our facial muscles computers could accurately guess a name about 60 percent of the time.Interestingly, in other experiments, Israelis were more able to identify other Israelis by name but not French people; the inverse was true for French people who were shown photos of Israelis.What the study meansThe authors warn that this study just chips at the surface, and lots more research is needed to confirm that any of these name-face links actually exist. They say it's possible that there are other explanations, one of which could be that people are just really good at process of elimination i.e. two of the five names on the list are easy to rule out, putting the odds smack at one in three.Then theres the explanation that may make the most sense: There could be a genetic component. Parents of a certain ethnicity are more likely to be drawn to some names over others, meaning names actually share similar physical, genetic traits (Patricks, lets say, might be more likely to have fair Irish skin and blue eyes).Or maybe its simply since babies often look like a mix of both Mom and Dad, parents just do a really good job of picking a name they actually deep down think would fit themselves.Whatever the case may be, don't get hung up too much on these findings. In the end, you will pick a name thats right for your baby. And if not, you can always change it.MORE BABY NAMES:25 Unique Baby Names for Girls25 Unique Baby Name for Boys15 Enchanting Biblical and Religious Baby Names"
