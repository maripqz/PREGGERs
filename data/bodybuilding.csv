Lifting For Two: Nicole Moneer's Full-Body Pregnancy Workout
The weights don't always have to go back on the rack when you find out you're pregnant. Here's how Bodybuilding.com athlete Nicole Moneer modified her workouts and kept training into the third trimester!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lifting-for-two-nicole-moneer-full-body-pregnancy-workout.html,"The difference between the first trimester in a pregnancy and the second and third is, to say the least, dramatic. As I detailed in my ""Guide to a Fit First Trimester,"" you experience a lot of mysterious and powerful feelings for those initial 12 weeksthirst, sleepiness, nausea, and bizarre cravings in my casebut you don't necessarily feel like you've got a living, wriggling person growing inside you. But then, at some point, that baby announces his or her presence with authority!This is when you start to feel really pregnantespecially in a physical sense. How women respond to this change varies incredibly from person to person. A number of people were shocked to see I was still lifting weights halfway through my pregnancy. I had to remind them that every woman is unique, just like every pregnancy is unique.My hope is that I can help you get the most benefit out of whatever training you can manage during the second and third trimesters of your pregnancy. To be clear, not all women feel like they can work out during this time, and in some cases, it's medically necessary for them not to. So check in frequently with your health care provider.But if you're up for it, join me as I show the modifications that allowed me to keep training all the way through my pregnancy!Nicole Moneer's Full-Body Pregnancy Workout Watch the video - 13:01 Nicole Moneer's Full-Body Pregnancy Workout Squat variations triset1Hip-width squat3 sets of 10-15 reps  Sumo squat3 sets of 10-15 reps  Split-stance lunge squat3 sets of 10-15 reps  2Thigh adductor3 double dropsets of 10 reps (don't take any sets to failure)  3Thigh abductor3 double dropsets of 10 reps (don't take any sets to failure)  4Seated cable rear-delt fly (chest expansion)3 sets of 10-15 reps  Note: Performed seated on exercise ball.5Knee push-up8-10 per side  6Seated dumbbell shoulder press3 sets of 10-15 reps  Superset7Seated biceps curl3 sets of 10-15 reps  Seated overhead triceps extension3 sets of 10-15 reps  Note: Rest 1-2 minutes between sets, or as needed. NotesKeep moving, keep active, and don't overdo it.Focus on opening up posture with arm exercises.Be confident, but reasonable. Every woman comes into pregnancy from a different place, and has different challenges to overcome and choices to make.Rest! A huge part of taking care of yourself and your child isn't working outit's resting.How to Hold On to FitnessDuring the second trimester, making customizations and listening to my body became far more important than it had seemed during the first trimester. If I felt the muscles in my abdomen stretching, I immediately switched to a seated exercise, decreased the weight, or stopped the exercise altogether. If something didn't feel good, I changed it up or didn't do it.You must take care, because reckless movements can lead to bleeding or tightening of the uterus or stomach, among other complications. If you are not a veteran lifter, hire a professional to teach you training adjustments. I accepted that many of my former ""normal"" activities would need modification, and I would probably experience greater muscle soreness.You must take care, because reckless movements can lead to bleeding or tightening of the uterus or stomach, among other complications.Here are some of the major adjustments I made:I kept teaching cardio-kickboxing classes, but I took needed breaks and kept the class moving even when I wasn't.I made the switch to push-ups from the knees. Before, I repped single-arm push-ups!I took Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off from the gym. I eventually worked down to two workouts per week, and that was plenty!I cut my cardio way back. Trust me, once you get past Week 30, just getting around is enough of a battle!No more crunches. I did a modified plank for a while, but eventually, core work ceased to really be feasible or advisable.As a special reward for all of this workand because it just felt greatI got deep-tissue pregnancy massages once a week, with special focus on my TFL [tensor fasciae latae], IT, sartorius, and glutes. I highly recommend this, but make sure your practitioner is trained in pregnancy massage specifically! I would always feel great after my massage, but the next day I was usually tight again from sleeping on my side.Keep on SquattingSquatting isn't just the best lift in weight training; it is also one of 12 natural positions for birth. I wasn't sure if I was going to give birth squatting, but I definitely kept doing squats throughout my pregnancy. This is one of my major messages to pregnant women: Just because you can't do what you used to doesn't mean you can't do anything! We can all benefit from using our muscles in some way.In the second half of my pregnancy, I was doing sets of 12 of unweighted Smith machine squats.It's the reverse of normal lifting, where you exercise, get progressively stronger, and increase the challenge. I lowered the weight, did more reps, and once I couldn't do a lift anymore, I just let it go.Just because you can't do what you used to doesn't mean you can't do anything! We can all benefit from using our muscles in some way.Even with just a few weeks to go, squats felt so good to do. I did multiple variations: sumo, hip-width, and sometimes narrow to strengthen all the muscles around my hips. I also did a lot of lunges. I knew I'd benefit from having a strong and flexible lower body, both during my birth and in those crucial post-partum recovery weeks.In the third trimester I felt the weight pulling as I carried dumbbells, so I carried them by my shoulders. For this reason, I also began relying on the Smith machine. It was safer with the weight, giving me stability and balance so there was little chance of me falling. If you are at home, squat into a chair, sit up, and stand up. Dial things back however you need.Some Numbers Go Down, Others Go UpYeah, about the weight: I allowed myself to gain 20 pounds through 30 weeks without freaking out the slightest bit. Moms need to have a healthy weight to have a healthy baby weight, and the amount that women gain can be widely variable. If you were underweight to begin with, you actually might gain more. It's not unheard of for women to gain 40 or even 50 pounds over the course of a pregnancy, and that's OK.With those crazy first-trimester cravings out of the way, I put my focus on eating quality food and didn't worry about counting calories precisely. I ate lots of protein, vegetables, and healthy fatssound familiar?Supplement-wise, I kept taking my whole food-based prenatal, and since I avoid store-bought dairy, I got extra calcium from leafy greens and supplements. I also started drinking Rejuvalec, a fermented wheatberry drink high in vitamin B, which I felt helped with nausea, my energy levels, and clear skin.  Sleep Get it When and How You CanSure, working out when you're pregnant is hard. But it's not nearly as hard as sleeping. Getting quality rest was the ultimate challenge!Unfortunately, sleeping doesn't get any less important as your pregnancy progresses. In fact, it becomes more precious, especially because you know some seriously sleepless nights are right around the corner once that baby is born.It got to the point where I sometimes needed a hand getting up and getting out of bed. In time, even the simple act of lying on my side became difficult because of all that weight. I slept on my back a lot, but propped upright with pillows. Sitting up helped me sleep slightly better. If I slept on either hip, my muscles would tighten up.My recommendation: Get pillows and a Snoogle. A Snoogle is a pregnancy pillow that helps prop up your legs so you can sleep in the fetal position. I hated sleeping on my side until I got one. If this doesn't work for you, well, keep looking until you find what does!Finding the Perfect LineupThe day I became pregnant, I became part of a clubthe mommy club. I heard all the storiesthe good and the bad, the danger and the joy. I saw that labor and delivery, while scary and overwhelming in many ways, could also be wonderful!I knew I wanted a healthy, natural delivery. I wanted to avoid medical intervention. I wanted a midwife, rather than a doctor. I had a vision and a plan, but also recognized that anything could happen the day of the birth. Still, I planned ahead to have the right team with me: my midwife, my doula, my partner, and my mom's best friendshe was there in my late mother's absence. I know other women who only wanted their partner there with them. That's their team, and it's fine, too. What's important is that you make full use of yours.It's like what do we do at Bodybuilding.com. We surround ourselves with like-minded people who share our goals, people who have overcome challenges and can help us do the same. I took that mentality with my pregnancy and birthing: teamwork, community, support. As the day got closer, I took great comfort in knowing who would be at my side.Fitness can teach you a lot about pregnancy, and vice versa. Set your own goals, then open yourself to others' remarkable stories and use that to keep your mindset positive. Then fearlessly transform your life!"

You have a wonderful new little person in your life who depends on you for everything. This is a magical, important time for both of you, and things like exercise and nutrition are probably far from your mindas they should be.It's important not to rush things. The journey to pregnancy is long, and it can be just as long a journey to get back to your prebaby body. But that doesn't mean you have to sit still. On the contrary, you need to keep moving!Months 1-3 Overview Watch The Video - 09:31In this video and article, I go over everything you can do in the weeks following your delivery to get prepared for when you're ready to begin my Jamie Eason's Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer. I include things you can do in the early days, such as walking, and some simple core and fitness routines for after you get the ""green light"" from your doctor.The Early DaysLet's be realistic. Despite your best intentions for getting back into pre-pregnancy shape, your baby, your bodyand of course, your doctorwill be calling the shots for a while. So while you're adjusting to your new life, keep your focus where it matters most: on you and your baby.It may not feel like it right now, but this time goes by fast, and you don't want to miss anything. You'll be better prepared for the training that's just around the corner if you embrace a healthy approach and set small, achievable goals now. Plus, you'll be less likely to feel discouraged once you're ready to begin working out.While you're adjusting to your new life, keep your focus where it matters most: on you and your baby.For the first few weeks after pregnancy, your primary goal can be as simple as going for a short daily walk. As your doctor will tell you, walking is important to get your blood flowing, prevent blood clots in your lower extremities, and help improve your bladder and bowel function. It's also great for your mental health. So get out the stroller and let's go outside!Once you're up to it, I recommend that you squeeze in walks whenever possible, even if they're just a few minutes long. Try to walk with your baby in a stroller for about 20 minutes a day, but don't worry about measuring it closely. If you need to rest or go home after just a few minutes, that's fine. If you feel good enough to walk more than 20 minutes, great, but don't push yourself.Listen to your body, and rest when it tells you to rest. When you transition to my Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer, you'll be turning up the intensity soon enough.The ""Green Light""Most doctors will give mothers the green light to work out at around 4-6 weeks after a vaginal delivery, and 6-8 weeks after a cesarean birthalthough this may be different in your case. That's why it's crucial that you talk to your doctor and make sure you're OK to start doing more than just your daily walks.Personally, I recommend not starting a full fitness program with strength training and cardio until your baby is sleeping through the night. This might take as long as three months or more. Why is this so important? For you to really benefit from a strength-training fitness routine, you need to be getting more than just a few minutes of rest here and there. You need real recovery, and that means sleep! Plus, by this time, most breastfeeding mothers will have established a consistent milk supply and something resembling a feeding schedule.PlankWhat Do I Do Until Then?Fortunately, there's a lot you can do before that three-month markor wherever it happens to fall for you. Once you have your doctor's permission, you can start doing some simple workouts focusing on your abdominals and your back, in addition to your walking routine. Both of these muscle groups will be considerably weakened by everything you've gone through, but you'll be using them a lot as you lift and move about with the baby.Important note: Be sure to check for diastasis recti (abdominal wall separation) before engaging in any abdominal wall exercise. This video details how to perform a self-check. If you have diastasis, ask your doctor about the therapeutic options available before you start working out.Diastasis Recti  Watch The Video - 01:32I've also created a complete plan for the period after you've gotten permission to begin exercising and you're ready to begin the full training plan detailed in the Training Overview video. For now, you'll be doing short core and back-focused workouts 3-4 times a week along with your normal walking. Do these preparatory workouts until your doctor clears you to increase exercise.

If you haven't watched the Months 1-3 video and looked at that program, do so before watching this video.For the last couple of weeks of that program, you'll work on your core and back strength, and increase the intensity of your daily walks. Once you're feeling comfortable with those circuits, and if you and your doctor think you're ready, it's time to take it up a notch and begin the circuit training program I created specifically for new moms.It's no coincidence that the Months 1-3 plan, this 12-week plan, and my 12-week LiveFit plan add up to roughly nine months total. That's how long you were pregnant, and my hope is that this three-pronged approach is exactly what you need to recapture your pre-pregnancy physiqueor maybe even your best physique ever. How does that sound?In this video and article, I'll give you an introduction to circuit training, outline the plan you'll be following for the next 12 weeks, and answer some of the questions you may have along the way.Training Overview Watch The Video - 12:42Am I ready for this?Jamie's Nine-Month PlanMonths 1-3: Post-pregnancy circuits Months 4-6: Post-pregnancy fitness trainer Months 7-9: LiveFitIf you've been feeling good and getting stronger, you're likely ready for the next stage of training. But if you're having any lingering pain, or if something simply doesn't feel right, be sure to talk to your doctor before you move on. If you have any symptoms of diastasis recti (abdominal wall separation), you may need more time before starting this section of the program. You can see a video about how to check for diastasis recti in the ""Months 1-3"" page.Of course, I understand that being ready means more than being physically prepared. You're probably still settling into life with your little one, and it can be daunting to think about finding any ""me time"" in your day for working out. The Time Management Overview can help with that to some degree, but missed days are bound to happen, especially in the first phase of the program.Don't sweat it. When this happens, simply start where you left off and keep going. Remember, this is a journey, not a daytrip. The important part is not to give up. This circuit-training program is meant to work with your busy schedule. Morning, noon, or night, fit it in where you can.What is circuit training?Circuit training is a style of training where you perform multiple exercises in a series. Your goal is to complete each exercise with little to no rest in between them, like you're doing one big, giant set. Then you rest and perform either another round or two of the same circuit, or a different circuit of exercises.Circuits are perfect for new moms because they work a lot of muscles in a short amount of time and can be customized for specific goals. Over the coming months, you'll perform circuits that build strength, add muscle mass, increase endurance, and strengthen your core muscles. Routines like my Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute Workoutwhich you'll find within the programare perfect for when you have a short window of time, want to get your heart rate up, and burn some calories.Circuits are perfect for new moms because they work a lot of muscles in a short amount of time and can be customized for specific goals.Another great thing about circuits? You can do them with weights like dumbbells or a medicine ball, or simply using your own body weight. So even if you don't have access to a gym right now, you can still make this plan work in less than half an hour per day. This type of routine is perfect if you can take advantage of your baby's naptime to do your training at home.For the first month of this program, you're going to use only your body weight. I found that with the right combination of exercises, this gave me all the challenge I needed. But if you feel like you want more intensity, feel free to add a medicine ball to some of the exercises.Phase 1 Weeks 1-4For the next eight weeks, you're going to train six days per week, with one well-deserved rest day every Sunday. During the first four weeks, which comprise Phase 1 of the program, you'll be alternating two circuits of bodyweight movements with two core-focused circuits. This arrangement makes it very easy to get back on track if you miss a day.Here's how it looks:WEEK 1-WEEK 3Monday: Napping baby circuitTuesday: Ab circuitWednesday: Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute WorkoutThursday: Swiss ball circuitFriday: Napping baby circuitSaturday: Stroller/carrier workoutSunday: RestWEEK 2-WEEK 4Monday: Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute WorkoutTuesday: Ab circuitWednesday: Napping baby circuitThursday: Swiss ball circuitFriday: Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute WorkoutSaturday: Stroller/carrier workoutSunday: RestOnce you're done with the first two weeks, you'll repeat: Week 3 will follow the exact same schedule as Week 1, and Week 4 will look like Week 2.You may have noticed that Saturdays are special during this month. I encourage you to get outside and spend time with your new baby. For this, I've designed two workouts you can do on a walk!The first is a stroller workout you can do on pretty much any street or in any park. You'll do things like bodyweight squats, lunges, and side leg raises while you're pushing the stroller, and step-ups, dips, and push-ups while it's parked.The second option is a workout you can do while your baby is strapped to you in a sling or a carrier. Choose one of these two workouts on Saturday while you're spending time with your baby. It should take no more than 15-20 minutes. Then, on Sunday, you'll rest up for the week to come.I encourage you to get outside and spend time with your new baby.Phase 2 Weeks 5-8After four weeks of alternating these bodyweight circuits, you'll be ready to step up your training and incorporate free weights. In this four-week phase, you'll perform routines I designed and followed myself to begin increasing both strength and muscle mass. This is when you'll really start to feeland possibly seethe gains you've been working for. Your baby is probably sleeping better by now, which means you're likely sleeping better too, and proper rest is really important for reaching your training goals.Just like in Phase One, you'll be training six days per week. But this time around, your week will be split into three strength workouts using a combination of weights and body weight, and three cardio workouts. Also unlike Phase One, each week in Phase Two will look the same:Phase twoMonday: Lower-body strength workoutTuesday: CardioWednesday: Upper-body strength workoutThursday: CardioFriday: Full-body strength workoutSaturday: CardioSunday: RestFor your cardio workouts, you can perform either the nap circuit or the 15-minute workout from Phase One, or if you prefer, 30 minutes of cardio training of your choice. If you're at home, consider running or jumping rope. If you have access to a pool, even swimming laps at a good pace can really get your heart rate up, so consider that as well.Your week will be split into three strength workouts using a combination of weights and body weight.Phase 3 Weeks 8-12Phase 3, the last four weeks of the plan, is where you really start focusing on regaining any muscle you may have lost, and hopefully growing new muscle as well! You'll follow a traditional four-day split:Phase ThreeMonday: Back and bicepsTuesday: RestWednesday: Shoulders and absThursday: RestFriday: Legs and calvesSaturday: Chest, triceps, and absSunday: RestWhere's the cardio, you ask? You can definitely still spend as much time walking the as you want and as your schedule allows, but the focus is to build muscle and strength during final four weeks. Remember, every bit of muscle you add actually burns fat, because muscle is ""metabolically active"" tissue, meaning it burns calories even at rest.Push-upsCan I do this at home?Home workout essentialsAdjustable dumbbellsSwiss/stability ballAdjustable benchJump ropeMedicine ballAdjustable barbellI did many of my workouts at home. Although it's tough to lift as heavy or hit the muscles with as much variety as you can at the gym, with just a little equipment you can still get a great workout.For me, being able to be home with my son and squeeze in a workout here and there was worth investing in a few key pieces of equipment. Dial-up dumbbells are ideal because they take up little space and offer a lot of variety. An adjustable bench or a platform is also a great accessory if you have the space. A jump rope, a medicine ball, and a stability ball don't cost much, and can be used a number of ways as well.If you have room in your life for one more item, I recommend a 25- or 30-pound barbell to which you can add weight plates. You can use it many ways for your legs, chest, shoulders, and arms. Buy new or check the local classifieds, Ebay, and Craigslist for people looking to unload equipment. Often, it has barely been used, and they are willing to sell it for a bargain just to make space.On the other hand, once you're ready, there's nothing wrong with bringing your baby to the daycare at your gym, if it has one. I waited until my son was sitting up and had good neck controlat around 6 monthsto take him.I know it can be hard to be away from your baby even for just an hour or two to exercise, but it's important to remember that your well-being affects the whole family. What's good for you is good for them, too!You can do this!So now that you have your plan to get back to training, be sure to watch the Nutrition Overview, Supplementation Overview, and Time Management Overview videos. Just like any other training plan, this is a complete approach, and making the most of it requires more than just breaking a sweat.JAMIE EASON SIGNATURE SERIESSUPPORT YOUR RESULTS WITH JAMIE EASON'S PERSONAL SUPPLEMENT LINE!

While many doctors will recommend you keep taking your prenatal multi while you're nursing, you want to be really careful taking more than that. There are even some supplements that you should definitely avoid if you're breastfeeding. Be sure to consult with your doctor and get their permission before starting any new supplement regimen, including this one.Truth be told, you really don't need much in the way of supplements post-pregnancy to stay in good health. But in my case, I did find that adding some clean protein made with natural ingredients really helped me meet extra nutritional needs I had after my son was bornespecially once I started training again.In this video and article, we're going to discuss whether supplemental protein has a place in your post-pregnancy plan. I'll share a couple of protein baking recipes that were staples in my house when I began training again. I'll also discuss supplement options for both nursing and non-nursing mothers.Supplementation Overview Watch The Video - 06:08How much protein do I need?Giving birth is hard on you. It takes time, rest, and plenty of calories for you to begin to recover. And if you're breastfeeding, you have a significantly higher demand being placed on your body from milk production.In addition to needing extra calories, nursing mothers also require additional protein. The recommended daily allowance of protein for pregnant and nursing women is nearly 50 percent above what it is for non-nursing women. And if you're looking to start training regularly or add muscle, those needs actually increase so you can adequately support exercise recovery and muscle growth.Once I began the Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer, I raised my daily protein intake to 1.5 grams per pound of body weight, which is what is usually recommended for athletes who are training hard and want to gain muscle. A level this high isn't necessary for everyone, though. The USDA recommends a minimum of just 71 grams of protein per day for breastfeeding moms, but every mom is a different size and weight, and may have different dietary and fitness goals.The recommended daily allowance of protein for pregnant and nursing women is nearly 50 percent above what it is for non-nursing women.A nursing mom needs between 200 and 500 extra calories per day to maintain milk production. But rather than counting calories, I simply listened to my body and paid attention to hunger cues, eating when I felt the urgeusually with additional protein. Since it's important to avoid certain types of fish when breastfeeding and I don't eat much dairy, it was sometimes hard to get enough protein from food alone.For this reason, I often relied on a natural protein powder like the ones I created for my Jamie Eason Signature Line. They're all free of artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, and sweeteners. I would either drink my protein as a shake or make homemade protein cookies, bars, and pancakes.If you know me, you know that I love baking with protein. Before I gave birth, I made all sorts of protein treats and froze them along with lots of other foods. These are easy snacks you can eat any timelike while you're nursing, or when you're too exhausted to even think about cooking.Some of my favorite protein recipes include pumpkin protein bars, cinnamon swirl protein bread, and many others from LiveFit and the Post-Pregnancy nutrition overview page!Beyond ProteinSo now that I've given you an overview of how protein can help you post-pregnancy, let's talk about some other specific supplement recommendations for both nursing and non-nursing moms.Aside from a protein powder made from natural ingredients, other safe options for nursing moms include a probiotic free of artificial sweeteners, as well as essential fatty acids such as krill oil, which is typically lowest in mercury. Another option to consider, especially with life being so busy, is a superfruit or greens product.As Dr. Dugan discusses in the video above, there may be some additional supplements that can help you, depending on your circumstances. Vitamin D, iron, and calcium are common deficiencies in new moms, for instance. Do your research, talk to your doctor, and learn your specific needs!  If you're not nursing, it's still important for you to get adequate protein to help regain any muscle you may have lost, so I recommend a natural protein powder, which you can take any time of daybut especially post-workout.In addition to the supplements I mentioned for nursing moms, you might also consider a pre-workout, multivitamin, and branched-chain amino acids.Supplements for nursing moms Jamie Eason Whey Protein Isolate Jamie Eason Skinny Bugs probiotic Jamie Eason Signature Series Krill oil Greens supplement Depending on needs; ask your doctor Calcium Iron Vitamin D Supplements for Bottle-Feeding Moms Jamie Eason Whey Protein Isolate Jamie Eason Skinny Bugs probiotic Jamie Eason Signature Series Krill oil Greens supplement Pre-workout Jamie Eason Signature Series Multi-vitamin Branched-chain amino acids Keep it simpleLet's be absolutely clear: You shouldn't rely on protein powder as your primary source of protein. This is true for all fit people, new mothers or not. You need whole foods and good nutrition, now more than ever! But if you're looking to fill the gaps in your diet, the ideas and recipes I provided here are a great place to start.Before you start training, be sure to watch the other videos in this series, including the Months 1-3 Overview and the nutrition, training, and time-management videos.

I'll talk about the old ""eating for two"" myth, and outline a nutritional approach to help you feel your best and work your way back to fitness.Nutrition Overview Watch The Video - 09:10Jamie Eason's Post-Pregnancy Trainer: Nutrition OverviewShare Videohttp://content.jwplatform.com/previews/Y4aIQS8t-HhhvXS5R<iframe src=""http://content.jwplatform.com/players/Y4aIQS8t-HhhvXS5R.html"" width=""320"" height=""260"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""auto""></iframe>Share VideoRelatedNext UpShaun Stafford's Wave-Load Back Workout00:0009:0500:0009:05Nutrition for nursing momsGiving birth is hard on the body. It takes time, rest, and plenty of calories to recover. And if you're breastfeeding, there's extra demand being placed on your body for milk production. When a mom is breastfeeding, she needs additional calories, protein, and other nutrients to both maintain her body and provide protein in breast milk for her baby. On average, a nursing mother needs about 35% more protein a day than a non-nursing mother.If a nursing mother doesn't eat animal products, she may need extra vitamin B12 as well. Other crucial nutrients that new mothers sometimes find themselves deficient in include iron, calcium, and vitamins C and D. Eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, protein, whole grains, and dairy product should be adequate to ensure that a nursing mom gets all that she needs. But stay in dialogue with your doctor to make sure you're avoiding any deficiencies.Eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, protein, whole grains, and dairy product should be adequate to ensure that a nursing mom gets all that she needs.That may sound like a lot to keep in mind, but post-pregnancy rehabilitation expert Dr. Sheila Dugan says you can stay on top of the game by keeping these principles in mind:Prioritize protein at every mealEat whole foods more often than highly processed onesPrioritize nutrients and macronutrients more than caloriesPlan aheadSurround yourself with what you know are good foods.Better planning, better food, better health. That sounds a lot more approachable, doesn't it?The Magic of Meal PrepWhere do I get my extra calories?I'm a fan of protein-rich snacks. To get your extra calories for the day, just pick any two of the snacks on the meal list below, or just follow the sample meal plan for your day of the plan!I knew that once my baby was born, I wouldn't have much time for cooking. So my goal while pregnant was to cook in bulk and freeze individual portions so I'd have healthy meals ready and waiting after we brought the baby home. It was a lifesaver!Of course, meal prep doesn't sound like much fun if you've never done it before. But here's the key: Don't let it sneak up on you. Pick one day a weekpreferably on the weekendand assemble your team and your supplies. You can knock out a week's worth of dinners in a single afternoon.Heading into the store when you're exhausted and in a hurry to get home to your baby is a guaranteed way of forgetting what you need and grabbing lots of stuff you don't want. Instead, have several of your favorite healthy meal recipes printed out and ready to go, so when you go to the store, you'll be sure to get exactly what you need.You may take this approach out of necessity at first, but that could change. Once you get into my training plan and start to see your body change, don't be surprised if you stick with itbecause it works!How much should I eat?When you were pregnant, you probably heard the old saying about ""eating for two."" Unfortunately, this isn't quite true. During pregnancy, your caloric intake only needs to increase by around 300 calories a dayalthough it can sure feel like more than that when you're having a craving!So what about after pregnancy? The general guideline is that you need to take in an additional 200-500 calories more than normal to support milk production. Here's a calculator to help you determine what that number looks like for you.Calorie Calculator WeightSelect OnePoundsKilogramsMinimum caloric intake ***Note: Dont count calories too strictly during this time. Listen to your hunger cues and make sure youre eating enough, especially while training.If you aren't breastfeeding, Dr. Dugan advises, you can get back to your regular pre-pregnancy calorie count once you're done healing from the birth and pregnancy. However, once you start training more intensely, consider raising your calories by about 500 per day, as well as increasing protein intake to around a gram of protein per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight.But bear in mind, these numbers are only guidelines. If you feel hungry, eat moreespecially while you're breastfeeding. I did! This isn't the time to count every calorie. The goal instead should be to make every calorie count. Try to eat the most nutritious foods possible at all opportunities.What types of foods should I eat?Whether you're breastfeeding or not, make every effort to eat wholesome foods that have been minimally processed. Focus on nutrient-packed vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean meats, and healthy fats. The approved foods list from my LiveFit trainer will work perfectly for you here as a reference.Note: I've also included sample meal plans for every day of the trainer, so when you go to get your day's workout, you can see those, too.Whether you're breastfeeding or not, make every effort to eat wholesome foods that have been minimally processed.But if recipes are your thing, here's a comprehensive list of the healthy options listed in the daily pages of the Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer.

Staying Fit While Pregnant
Not sure how to maintain your fitness while you're pregnant? Fit mama and FitMiss athlete Noora Kuusivuori has the info you're looking for!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/staying-fit-while-pregnant.html,"Being pregnant is an extraordinary experience. There's nothing else like it in the world. Your body goes through amazing changes, and you live each day of those nine months knowing you're growing another human! However, strong opinions abound about what you should and shouldn't do as a pregnant woman, especially when it comes to fitness. The further along I get in my pregnancy, the more likely I am to hear questions like ""Why are you still in the gym?"" and ""Why are you still lifting weights?"" My question back to them is always ""Why not?"" I trained before I was pregnant, and now, well into my third trimester, I'll keep training. Staying active has helped me stay healthy and within the recommended weight-gain guidelines, which is about 30 pounds. This is my second pregnancy, so I know that working out helps my postpartum recovery feel easier, and the road to getting my body back won't seem so overwhelming. Staying active has helped Noora stay healthy and within the recommended weight-gain guidelines.If you're pregnant and want to know a little more about how to train, eat, and use supplements, then read on! I'll go over my pregnancy fitness regimen and how it differs from my usual routine. Then, you can take that gorgeous baby bump of yours and hit the gym!*Before beginning or modifying an exercise program during pregnancy, consult with your doctor or midwife. Lifting Weights If you were training with weights before you were pregnant, it's generally safe to continue while you're pregnant. In fact, current national and international guidelines recommend that healthy women should perform resistance training throughout pregnancy.1-3 However, make sure you check with your doctor or midwife before starting. Lifting weights is important, because strong muscles will help you carry that extra person with you at all times. Having a strong back and legs will also help alleviate some of the pain associated with a growing belly. Improvements in overall body strength, core strength, and posture can prevent musculoskeletal discomforts and help during labor and delivery.4 Working out while you're pregnant can help alleviate pain, improve posture, and strengthen your core.When you're in the gym, make sure you listen to your body. You can't get ""more fit"" while you're pregnant, so adjust your mindset. Stick to maintenance instead of gaining or losing. If something doesn't feel right, just skip it. Exercises that call for you to lie flat on your back or lean your abdomen against a pad may start to feel uncomfortable, so look for alternatives. I love using dumbbells, because I can work them around my kangaroo pouch. In general, I've decreased the weight I use by 30-50 percent. I still want to challenge myself, but I also want to make sure I'm being safe. I like to slow down my repetitions, do negatives, or do more reps than I normally would. You can still feel the burn, even with lighter weight. Stretching I typically don't have the time or patience for yoga classes, but because I can't train as intensely as I usually do, I've started to explore them. And I can honestly say that my body loves doing yoga! As my baby gets bigger, my muscles start to feel more tense. Stretching has helped to loosen me up and keeps me feeling limber and ready for labor. The more flexible I am, the easier it is for me to move around. It's especially important in that third trimester, when it's damned near impossible to bend over or reach anything below my knees!MusclePharm: 100% Whey IsolateUltra-Fast-Release Protein To Accelerate Muscle Building!Go Now!Nutrition I didn't eat enough protein during my first pregnancy. Like most women, I just craved carbohydrates. My son was born two months early, and he was tiny! He was far smaller than a set of twins born at the same gestational age. I asked their mother what she did to make sure that her babies were a healthy weight, and her answer was that she ate lots of protein. So, I took a leaf out of her book during my second pregnancy and made sure to eat more protein. I've used MusclePharm 100% Whey Isolate in shakes and bakes throughout my pregnancy and have done a much better job getting enough protein this time around. I also add my favorite Combat Crunch bars as snacks. To grow big and strong, your baby needs a balanced, varied, and healthy dietjust like you!Along with protein, I eat plenty of carbohydrates. When I'm not pregnant, I usually stick to a pretty low-carb diet, so eating as much fruit, quinoa, oatmeal, and rice as I want has been pretty fun. I also try to eat a good variety of healthy vegetables like spinach, kale, and other greens. For healthy fat sources, I like avocado, olive oil, salmon, nuts, and coconut oil. To grow big and strong, your baby needs a balanced, varied, and healthy dietjust like you! Hydration When you're pregnant, you share fluids with another human, so it's especially important to drink a lot of water. There's no reason to carry around a gallon jug, but instead of those sodas or juices you usually drink, make the switch to water. Supplementation Supplements like fat burners and pre-workouts should be cut as soon as you have a positive pregnancy test, but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy the benefits of other supplements. A prenatal vitamin with folic acid should be first on your list. Besides the MusclePharm Isolate protein powder, I also like to take MusclePharm fish oil, because the DHA is important for my baby's brain and eye development. The 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services dietary guidelines recommend that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding consume 8-12 ounces of seafood per week, or about 300-900 milligrams of EPA+DHA per day.5 Studies suggest that children whose mothers consumed DHA during pregnancy have better problem-solving skills.6,7 Studies suggest that children whose mothers consumed DHA during pregnancy have better problem-solving skills.I've also continued to use BCAAs, which are generally considered safe to use during pregnancy, but I still recommend talking to your doctor before using them. High levels of BCAAs in children may pose some risk, so if you're already getting enough protein via whole foods, you may not need to supplement with additional BCAAs.Mental Health Growing a new life is a magical process, but it can also be scary and stressful. Do your best to enjoy this time. Stop worrying about how you'll lose the baby weight or if you've decorated the baby's room enough. Instead, cherish all the kicks and punches, and remember that the pregnancy period is just a short time of your life. You can start bonding with your baby while he or she is still in your belly. I've already created a special bond with my daughter by talking to her and acknowledging her movement in my womb. She moves around a lot when I work out, so I rub my belly and give her props for her big strong moves. Whatever your way of bonding with your baby, it's never too early to start!

They're tiny, delicate, a little wild, andof courseadorable. Know what else they are? Unpredictable. Who can blame them? They've been dropped into a brand-new world, and they don't even know what they need yetexcept you, of course.From day one, that little person pretty much owns you and your time. Trust methat will change, but not overnight. And even when you finally feel ready to start working out and your doctor says it's OK, you still might not see how you could possibly find the time.I know the feeling! I was there too. But with experience, I found that post-pregnancy was a great opportunity to examineand attack some of the biggest reasons women say they ""can't"" get fit. That's right: This is an opportunity!On this page, I'll talk about some of the ways you can rebuild your fit life in the middle of a crazy, unpredictable schedule. We'll go over managing your expectations, preparing your space, setting your priorities, and a skill that, let's face it, many moms have trouble mastering: sharing responsibility.Let's figure out how to make this work. You deserve it!Time Management Overview Watch The Video - 10:59Solution 1 Manage your expectations Jamie's Nine-Month PlanMonths 1-3: Post-pregnancy circuitsMonths 4-6: Post-pregnancy fitness trainerMonths 7-9: LiveFitMany women find they are able to exercise to some degree throughout most of their pregnancy, depending on their specific circumstances and what their doctor says is OK. But all of that changes when the baby comes. You don't even know what you'll be recovering fromonly that you'll be recovering. For instance, I developed a painful condition called De Quervain syndrome because I could only nurse my son on one side. I definitely never saw that coming!But acute conditions like that aside, your first couple of months as a mom are still pretty difficult, whether this is your first child or your fourth. People say it's like a haze or a dreamand they're right. You sleep when you canor if you can. You struggle to solve problems you knew you'd have, and some you couldn't have predicted. Plenty of women also have to deal with going back to work, or their partner doing so, before they feel ready.Because there's so much going on, many women gladly wait until they get a ""green light"" from their doctor to begin exercising, usually at around 6-8 weeks. But if it takes longer than that for you, then that's OK. I can't emphasize that enough!I know that when you're in bed and not feeling great about how your body looks, it can be easy to set big, ambitious goals on little, ambitious timelines. Resist the urge! The nine-month plan I describe in the program overview is just one possible outcome. You might need longer than thatmaybe a lot longer. That's fine. What matters far more is simply making progress and making healthy choices.My biggest advice is to make the three-week ramp-up plan to the Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainerwhich I talk about in the Months 1-3 Overview last as long as you need it to. But while you're keeping things simple, keep your eyes open for opportunities to make a ""system"" to give yourself a bit more time. Maybe it's as simple as having your partner take a daily feeding, so you can slip into your workout clothesor just into bed.And if your body says that you need to hit ""pause"" for a few days, you can just pick up where you left off when you're ready.And if your body says that you need to hit ""pause"" for a few days, you can just pick up where you left off when you're ready.Solution 2 Prepare your spaceHome workout essentialsAdjustable dumbbellsSwiss/stability ballAdjustable bench Jump ropeMedicine ballAdjustable barbellI've heard many, many women say they ""can't"" train effectively at home for one reason or another. They don't have the physical space, for instance, or they simply can't avoid getting pulled in a million different directions. I understand these concerns, but I think that in most cases, there are solutions. Prepare your space before you start working out, and you'll be able to thrive in it!What does this mean? Let me give you a few examples. I did the majority of my workouts during this trainer at home, but make no mistake: I didn't have a ""home gym,"" per se. All I had were a few key implements, but I chose them carefully.Sometimes, you may have to train in one room, sometimes another, depending on what's happening and who's sleeping or playing where.For instance, rather than buying a whole range of dumbbells, I picked out adjustable ones. They take up the same amount of space, but you won't outgrow them in just a few workouts like you do with nonadjustable bells.I could tell you to always train in the same place in your housesay, the garage or the living roombut that doesn't always work. Sometimes, you may have to train in one room, sometimes another, depending on what's happening and who's sleeping or playing where. So instead, I'll just say to have a dedicated space where you store your fitness essentials, so you can find them quickly and take them where you need to go to train.I's crucial to make everything as convenient as possible. All it takes is one excuse like, ""Ugh, I have to go to the garage to find the so-and-so"" to make a workout disappear. That's one reason to train during the morninglike, early morning before your excuses have a chance to wake up and get in the way.Put your workout clothes by your bed so you can scoop them up and not wake anyone. Prepare tomorrow's workout today, and watch your excuses go up in smoke.Solution 3 Establish your fitness prioritiesI know what it's like to feel as if you have to choose between options you'd prefer not to have to choose betweenlike ""sleep or a workout,"" for instance, or ""dinner or cleaning."" But it's a part of parenthood, and especially new parenthood. So what do you do ifor rather, whenyou find yourself in a position where you can't do it all? Stick to your fitness priorities.Here's what they are during this trainer:SleepMovementWorking outNutritionLet me break it down.Sleep: Fitness needs sleep. Even with my background in fitness, getting back to the gym wasn't even on my radar until my son was 3 months oldand barely then. I was waiting for him to get on a more regular sleep schedule, and I was still feeling tired more often than not. I know for some women, even this timeline seems ambitious.But I also knew from experience that without proper sleep, I wouldn't be able to regain my lost muscle anyway, so I was OK waiting. This can be hard for some people to understand, especially if they've never really prioritized sleep in the past. But those of us in the fitness industry know that if you want to change your body, you need sleep. Your baby definitely knows this! So until you are getting sleep regularly, that's your highest fitness priority.Movement: During the first 1-3 months after your pregnancy, you're ahead of the game if you're able to get outside and walk every day. Not run, walk. It's OK if that's as far as your fitness ambitions go for a while. Simply moving is a much higher priority than getting fit.  Working out: If you have family, friends, or a sitter to watch the baby, you might even be able to squeeze in some time at the gym. But, as I mentioned earlier, it's not crucial. When you're ready, simply working out on a consistent basis is a higher priority than crushing it at the gym. A lot of babies enjoy watching their moms exercise, especially with some music on. You can have your own little audience while you take the first steps in regaining your pre-baby body.Nutrition: It may surprise you to see nutrition here, toward the bottom. When you do something like prepare for a competition or event, sure, nutrition is the highest priority. But new moms usually can't afford to be that scientific. Your baby's digestion is still immature, and if you're breastfeeding, some of your favorite fit foods may make for some sleepless nights.Should you make healthy choices? Of course. But understand that, for a while, simply getting enough calories is more important than dialing in your macros. If you're really hungry, it may be a sign that you need to eat more! Your body is going through a lot right now. Babies have a way of complicating the best-laid plans, so get ready for it.Solution 4 Share responsibilityYou've heard people say it takes a village to raise a child. They're not lying! And once you set the goal of reclaiming your fitness level and physique, you'll need make use of whatever support system you have. Those who love you will want you to feel good, and they know that being a mother isn't easy. So let them help you.I know what you're saying: ""It's not that simple."" I said the same thing. But once I began to look for ways I could share responsibility rather than taking everything on myself, my life definitely changed for the better.You've heard people say it takes a village to raise a child. They're not lying! And once you set the goal of reclaiming your fitness level and physique, you'll need make use of whatever support system you have.Let your partner take a feeding or strap on the carrier so you can have a little time to yourself. Invite over a friend or hire a babysitter, even if you're just heading into the garage to lift some dumbbells. If you have family locally, let them watch the baby for an hour or two. When the time comes, consider dropping your little one at your gym's daycare, if it has one.Sure, it can be hard to let go, but think of it this way: You're modeling a healthy, reasonable approach to the fit life for your child to follow. In the long term, isn't that the most important thing?The Time of Your LifeNo two pregnancies are the same, and no two children are the same. So I can't predict the specific challenges that will try to get in the way of your post-pregnancy fitness goals. But with the tools I've outlined here, I hope you'll be better equipped to handle whatever comes your way.Now be sure to watch the Months 1-3 Overview , Training Overview, Nutrition Overview, and Supplementation Overview to learn everything you need to take control of your physique and get back to fit!JAMIE EASON SIGNATURE SERIESSUPPORT YOUR RESULTS WITH JAMIE EASON'S PERSONAL SUPPLEMENT LINE!

Women:  Stay Fit While Pregnant - Here's How!
Are you pregnant and not sure about healthy weight gain and activity level? Moms-to-be you can stay fit during this time by using the following nutrition and training guidelines to ensure both mom and the baby’s health! Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/stay_fit_pregnancy.htm,"Diet  Good pregnancy nutrition is vital to delivering a healthy baby. Your child is totally dependent on you for nourishment, so eating well for two is of utmost importance. It is worth the time and effort to plan a well rounded, balanced diet, which will help insure that your baby is getting adequate nutrients during pregnancy, and which will also provide you the needed energy to get you through the day.  Try not to worry about gaining weight. Pregnancy isn't the time to be cutting back on calories. In fact, a gradual, steady weight gain is a good sign, in making sure your baby is gaining the necessary weight. Cutting calories not only robs your baby's delicate growing organs, but it robs your body of needed nutrition, and has the potential to slow your metabolism, the very thing you do not want.  Pregnancy Articles:  Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide! - By Bryna DeLuca Weight Training & Pregnancy! - By David Robson So You're Pregnant: Now What? - By Shannon Clark Other Pregnancy Articles...  Remember when choosing your diet, quality is more important than quantity. Most pregnant women need about 300 additional calories per day. Daily calories should consist of grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, nuts and dairy products.  Serving size recommendations for the average, healthy pregnant woman include 6-11 servings of breads and grains, two-four servings of fruit, four or more servings of vegetables, four servings of dairy products, and three servings of protein sources (meat, poultry, fish, eggs or nuts).  There is no reason to avoid foods you crave as long as you eat in moderation to avoid excessive weight gain, so limit saturated fats and sweets. Eat 5-6 small meals every two to three hours. Even if you're not hungry, your developing baby needs regular sustenance, and high frequency eating ensures proper blood glucose levels inhibiting the dreaded insulin spike, which causes that afternoon energy crash.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  How Often Should You Eat?  Along with increased attention to your diet, you are likely trying to eat every three hours. Do you have to be anal about this? Absolutely not!   Author: Shannon Clark  As a pregnant mom, you don't need anything else to rob yourself of energy, so avoid skipping meals. Prenatal vitamins and mineral supplements are usually recommended by most prenatal care providers, but should not be used in place of eating a balanced diet, however.  Always consult with your health care provider before taking vitamins or supplements. Most importantly, avoid alcohol, smoking and harmful drugs. Try to avoid caffeine as much as possible. If you need a cup, go decaffeinated. Always keep it safe for baby. View Pre-Natal Vitamins Sorted By Top Seller Here. Exercise  Exercise is also very important, despite the changes in your growing belly. It may seem like a perfect time to sit back and relax, but in fact, pregnancy can be a great time to stay active.  A good pregnancy workout has several benefits for the mom-to-be. It will help increase circulation, improve your posture, help with sleeplessness and help to control your weight while toning your muscles, making it easier to get back into shape after you deliver.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Pregnant & Working Out.   I recently losta lot of weight and now I'm really starting to miss working out. I've been told that I can do cardio but only walking and at low speeds.   Started By: Stoofinoof  Exercise also helps you stay flexible, which will benefit you during labor and delivery. Make sure you do not over do it. Hormones occur during pregnancy, which soften ligaments and connective tissues to prepare your body for labor. Stay away from fast, jerky movements at all costs because it could easily lead to injury.  Focus on moving at a slow and controlled rate. Moderate repetition incorporating low weight or light resistance during this time in your life, will insure an injury-free and healthy pregnancy. Remember, this is not the time to train, but to maintain.  First, be sure to talk with your doctor to make sure it is safe to continue your exercise routine, to identify such conditions as preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy). This time spent with the doctor can help identify any specific risk factors to your individual situation.   Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is a medical condition where hypertension arises in pregnancy in association with significant amounts of protein in the urine.   Because preeclampsia refers to a set of symptoms rather than any causative factor, it is established that there can be many different causes for the syndrome.    Low-Impact Aerobics     An excellent form of  cardiovascular exercise for moms-to-be, is low-impact aerobics. This involves no jumping or hopping movements, or stepping upon any type of platform, putting you at risk of jarred joints, but includes rhythmic movements that keep one foot on the floor at all times. You can find these kinds of classes at your local gym or YMCA. If you prefer working out in the privacy of your own home, pregnancy DVDs/videos are available at most stores.

[ Check Out The Cardio Super Feature Here! ]    Exercising In Water      An ideal aerobic exercise for pregnant women is  swimming. Due to the buoyancy of the water it eliminates any  stress on your joints and provides gentle resistance for maintaining muscle tone. The same goes for pool walking or a water aerobics class, typically done waist deep.   RELATED VIDEO   Water Aerobics Exercises: Deep Water Exercises For Water Aerobics!

Walking     Walking is one of the best and safest ways to get exercise and is easily worked into almost any daily routine. Taking a brisk walk through the mall, around a neighborhood park with a friend, or an after dinner, sunset stroll with your husband, can be a fun and convenient way to stay in shape with little or no cost to you.

Strength Bands     Depending on how you use them, strength bands (also called  resistant bands) can be great for beginners as well as more advanced exercisers, to add some light to medium resistance to your workouts, without the use of free weights. You can use them for basic exercises or to add intensity to traditional moves.   These bands are made from latex material or thick elastic cording and are available with or without handles. Bands range anywhere from $6 to $20, depending on how many you get and where you buy them, which is nice for the budget-conscious mom. They are lightweight and easily transported from home to office or vice versa.

[ Click here to learn more. ] Note: Always use caution when using strength bands, for the possibility of breakage. Weight Training  To insure the safety of you and your future newborn here's some guidelines to follow:  Perform 2 exercises per body part, versus 3 sets each. Increase your rest periods to 2 minutes between sets, to avoid getting too hot and a dangerously elevated heart rate (Keep below 140 beats per minute). And be sure to avoid holding your breath at any given time.  Keep the resistance low to moderate depending on your stage of pregnancy and your reps between 8-10 (Stay away from reaching muscle failure). Eliminate all exercises that require lying on your back. This position may decrease the blood flow to the uterus and therefore the baby. Eliminate all abdominal exercises or exercises that require lying on your stomach (Ex. Lying leg curls). Eliminate exercises that may cause loss of balance. Lunges and squats should be substituted for seated leg curls and leg extensions. Free weights may also add to your loss of balance, so the use of machines is recommended to prevent joint injuries. If free weights are used, you should always pay close attention to your form.

You have the ability to relax and control these muscles in preparation for labor and birth. They are also encouraged during the postpartum period to promote healing of perineal tissues, increase urinary control and help these muscles return to their healthy state after giving birth.

Choose an exercise outfit that will follow you through your pregnancy. Think about comfort. You want clothing that will keep you (and your baby) from getting too hot while you work out.

So make sure you are drinking plenty of  water before, during and after your workout. This will insure your core temperature doesn't rise to a dangerous level for you and your baby.   Get Plenty Of Rest   Sleep is very important for the mom-to-be. During the first trimester, your body works to protect and nurture the developing baby. Your body makes more blood for the forming placenta (the organ that nourishes the fetus until birth), making your heart pump faster.   As the baby grows, you may find it difficult or uncomfortable to lie down as before. Taking catnaps throughout the day can be a great way to get that extra needed sleep, you may be lacking during the night. Once the baby comes, it will be very difficult to even find time to rest, so get it in while you can.

How Preparing For Competition Is Like Pregnancy.
The following article may sound especially familiar to women who are already mothers. Let's take a look at a humorous side of competition training.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/blackburn6.htm,"As I prepared for my most recent figure competition, I could not help but acknowledge the many similarities between the feelings involved when pregnant and when preparing for a competition. The following article may sound especially familiar to women who are already mothers. Let's take a look at a humorous side of competition training.  Planning It Out   To begin with, preparation for ""the big event"" takes planning and a lot of money. After all, you want the best for this new part of your life. There are also many unexpected incidentals that come up which eat at your pocketbook. New clothing, professional experts, pampering, and educational materials all compete for your time and wallet!  When starting to prepare for this endeavor, you find yourself wondering how your body will change and look as time goes by. You are going to go through some big transitions! Will you even recognize yourself after all of this? You may even doubt your abilities to embark on the challenge and wonder if you are up to performing in this important role.  Be careful not to compare yourself to others. You do not have to live up to the image presented by someone else in this same role; you only need do your personal best. Be prepared to be given tons of advice and be willing also to seek out help from those who have already been there.  You'll find yourself really wanting to be the finest you can and savoring this special time in your life. Of course, you will want to do your best as you will not have a chance to do this particular event over again.  You will find that friends and family will be asking you, ""When is the date?"" and ""How much longer do you have?"" You may also feel like your body is on display for others to watch as you make progress towards the end result. As the changes in your body become more noticeable, you may feel like you are the center of attention.  Even strangers may inquire about what you are experiencing. Don't be surprised if you are poked and asked if your stomach can be viewed! Another common question will be about your weight status and how it has changed since you began this experience.  At this wonderful stage in your life you will want to make sure that you get enough of the right vitamins and supplements. A good cream for stretch marks may also be in order. You will need to get plenty of rest and take care of your body. As the big day gets closer, increasingly more ailments begin. The process is getting more difficult! You may get very tired, have achy muscles, and experience mood swings! People will learn not to take your emotions and attitudes personally. You may start to worry what will happen if there are any complications.    Tips & Tricks For The First Time Figure Competitor!  If you think that competing in a figure competition is less strenuous, or requires less dedication than competing in a bodybuilding competition, think again. Find out how I train, diet and much more...  [ Click here to learn more. ] Here is another big one. You will likely find yourself hungry and craving specific foods! You don't want to gain too much weight, though. Making the right kind of gains is important.  Another observation to point out is that if your relationship or marriage is not already strong, this process and event will probably cause strain and not make the relationship any stronger. There is a great deal of stress involved and even though it is a fun time, it can easily overtake the whole family. Make sure all people involved are supportive.  The day is drawing nearer. Your nervousness starts changing into feelings of just wanting it to be over! This is all starting to take its toll on your body and mind.   When the day does arrive, just shoot modesty out the window! There is no place for it in this environment. Your body will be exposed to a multitude of strangers and you will probably be in less clothing than ever before. Did you ever think you would be revealing yourself in this way to so many people and so up close and personal?  Conclusion     How Hard Is Preparing For A Competition? One Of The Hardest Things A Person Could Do.           Pretty Hard, But Not That Hard!           Not Really That Hard.                Finally, the big day arrives. While performing it may seem to take forever! You are really trying to do your best. Yet in other ways it is really quite short compared to the preparation time. When it is all said and done, you may find yourself reflecting on all the months prior to the event.  You prepared and looked forward to this day and now feel a slight sadness that it is over. So much time, effort and care went into preparing and now it is done. Yet, look at what you have accomplished! It is most definitely something for which you can take pride. It was a lot of hard work and you did it! You will be able to enjoy the results of your hard work for a long time to come; the pain was worth it!  Shall we do it again?"

Suggestions For Others  The biggest obstacle for me was the diet, and since diet is 80% of your results, you need to have it perfect. I would suggest hiring a nutritionist to create your diet so you can get the best results possible, and learn about nutrition along the way.  A trainer is a great investment when starting out so you can learn proper form and technique. The biggest key is being patient and believing in yourself. It will take time, hard work, dedication, and sacrifice, but in the end you'll learn a lot about yourself and you'll be stronger and healthier because of it.

It wasn't until I got married and had a baby that I started to gain weight. I spent the next three years overweight and depressed. I hated the way I looked and the way I felt. In my mind, everyone around me seemed smaller and fit. I was living like a couch potato not realizing the lifestyle I was being dragged into. ""Insecure"" is the best word to describe how I felt during that time. My daily routine was getting up early and barely eating anything, mostly junk foods. I spent nights crying because of the way I looked. I didn't want to go shopping for clothes because I would get depressed. The worst part was that I knew what it was like to be skinny and addicted to the gym. And I was so far from it. Getting older and having a family doesn't mean you are supposed to get unhealthy and stop thinking about yourself. I had to make my health a priority. Not being able to look at myself in pictures and not liking what I saw was my turning point. In June of 2008, I decided to change my life. Not only did I want to fit in my old jeans, but I wanted a healthier lifestyle. My aunt had the same struggles and achieved her weight loss goals. She gave me the tools to start my own path. It was up to me to follow in her steps. So I began this journey without any regrets. I knew it was the right thing to do. It took me five months to achieve my weight loss goal. I realized that this is not just a diet. This is a healthy lifestyle. I'm inspired to help other achieve their goals too.  Click Image To Enlarge.I'm Inspired To Help Other Achieve Their Goals Too. How I Did It  First of all, I needed to concentrate on my goal. I set a date, kept a journal, and did research on nutrition and fitness. I knew it was not going to be easy, but I still took the risk. It was all worth it. It was hard at first to take my body out of a sedentary routine and force it to work out. It took help and knowledge of a family member to get me up and going. I had to learn first how to distinguish between what was healthy and what was junk food. My main objective was to replace foods with healthy ones. I started by taking all the junk food out of the kitchen and bought healthy, nutritious foods. Another thing that helped me was looking at old pictures of myself when I used to be fit and imagined myself fitting again in those clothes. I took a lot of before pictures and after pictures to see my progress each month. That alone kept me going. During this journey I completely submitted myself to achieving my weight loss goal.

Diet  I followed a basic eating plan. I kept an eye on the nutritional facts on everything. I didn't deprive myself of food. I replaced them with nutritious ones. I had 5-to-6 meals a day, small portions with snacks in between. I also forced myself to eat more vegetables and fruits. I also had plenty of water during the day and always allowed myself one cheat meal every week. I was always making sure I ate all my portions and keep up with my exercise plan.

Training  My routine included lots of cardio and weights. I remember going to the park and not even knowing if I could run. When I tried it felt like I was carrying shopping bags in my hands. That didn't stop me. First I started walking for half an hour. Then after the weeks passed I moved up to jogging and walking for 30-or-40 minutes. This routine was done five days per week with two days of rest. If there was a day I couldn't go to the park, I would follow kickboxing videos. Besides cardio, my other plan of attack was my weight routine. I did weight training three days per week.Day 1: Cardio And Full Body WorkoutDay 2: Cardio And Full Body WorkoutDay 3: RestDay 4: Cardio And Full Body WorkoutDay 5: CardioDay 6: RestDay 7: Cardio Full Body Workout: Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 15 repsDumbbell Curls: 3 sets of 15 repsMilitary Press: 3 sets of 15 repsBent Over Barbell Rows: 3 sets of 15 repsSeated Triceps Press: 3 sets of 15 repsSeated Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15 repsBarbell Squats: 4 sets of 20 repsDumbbell Lunges: 4 sets of 15 repsCrunches: 3 sets of 20 repsReverse Crunches: 3 sets of 20 repsSide Bends: 3 sets of 15 repsButt-Ups: 3 sets of 15-20 secondsAir Bike: 3 sets of 20 repsquickstart_training(""Full Body Workout"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=Dumbbell+Bench+Press:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Dumbbell+Curls:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Military+Press:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Bent+Over+Barbell+Rows:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Seated+Triceps+Press:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Seated+Calf+Raises:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Barbell+Squats:+4+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Dumbbell+Lunges:+4+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Crunches:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Reverse+Crunches:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Side+Bends:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Butt-Ups:+3+sets+of+15-20+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Air+Bike:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&TotalExercises=13&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=Jesse+Velazquez&name=Full+Body+Workout""); Get A Printable Log Of Full Body Workout.

There's no better reward than knowing that all your hard work is paying off.  Click Image To Enlarge.There's No Better Reward Than KnowingThat All Your Hard Work Is Paying Off. Suggestions For Others  Don't skip meals, and if you don't feel that hungry, eat something light. This will help you avoid sugar and late-night cravings. Don't skip breakfast, it's the most important meal of the day. It will give you energy and make you feel full. If you are in a hurry and don't have time to cook, make a power smoothie that will leave you full.  I find very important that if you drink a lot of protein, you should also get lots of fiber and plenty of water.  Don't deprive yourself of foods. Simply choose the healthy ones! Replace them! Look for new ingredients and learn new recipes.  Don't let other people bring you out of focus. Invite them to join your healthy journey. Find a workout buddy to keep yourself motivated and also help motivate others.  Change your weight lifting routine every 6-to-8 weeks to avoid getting your muscles accustomed.  Give your muscles a break to rest. Avoid doing strength training too many days in a row. Your muscles will build and repair during rest.  Make sure you have quality shoes for your chosen activity. Picking the right shoes for a cardio workout (like running) will prevent injuries.  Try new activities. Doing the same thing can lead to plateaus, boredom and injuries.  To reach a healthy weight you need to be patient. No miracle pills or diet will make you lose weight the right and healthy way.  Practice your favorite sports (like volleyball, softball, tennis, rock climbing, and basketball). It'll be a fun workout when you play with your friends. Personally, I love boxing!

Bodybuilding For Babyboomers - Shaping Up For Summer, The Baby Boomer Way!
Shaping up the baby boomer way means training hard, yet training smart. That means employing science and the wisdom that only comes with age to our training. Learn why!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babyboom27.htm,"Shaping Up For Summer, The Baby Boomer Way!Click Here For Part Two! While many parts of the U.S. continue to be blasted by snowstorms it's hard to change the mindset to think about warmer weather and summer activities. But, beware boomers; bathing suit season is just around the corner. It's time to get ready.  Shaping up the baby boomer way means training hard, yet training smart. This Legendary Fitness team wants you fit for this summer, and many summers to come. That means employing science and the wisdom that only comes with age to our training. Let's let those kids burn themselves out with their training programs that maximize gains at the high cost of lost training time from injuries. We know better.  Get Your Nutrition In Order! Keep a training journal. Write down everything you eat. Every piece of gum, candy and taste of food. Hundreds of calories are ingested each day as a taste or just a bite as we are running to another activity. You need to be aware of exactly how much you are putting in your mouth each day. [Diane: I like to use the Gold's Gym training journal due to the two-page format. It allows you to view daily resistance training, nutrition and cardio. And there's plenty of room for notes. Richard: I don't use anything formal to log daily nutrition. Just one piece of paper lasts a long time as I use my own codes, (EW for egg whites) and eat the same thing on a daily basis when dieting.]  Clean out the pantry. Eliminate temptations by throwing away cookies, cakes and snacks. DON""T feel bad about the waste of money. You're a tough Baby boomer on route to a Legendary Physique this summer and will not let $15 worth of Oreos and pretzels stand in your way of success.  Re-stock the pantry and refrigerator with appropriate foods to build a better body.  Brown rice, oatmeal, steel-cut oats, rye or whole wheat bread Eggs Canned tuna Lean protein such as chicken, fish and beef Green vegetables such as peppers, broccoli, celery, green beans and cucumbers Bagged salads when on the run Fruits that are low on the glycemic index such as strawberries and melon Low sodium soy sauce, salsa, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, non-stick cooking spray Sweet potatoes Non-fat cottage cheese and yogurt Non-fat milk Almonds Sugar-free popsicles when in a pinch  Stock up on protein supplements. Eating small meals about every three hours makes it difficult to consume so many 'real' meals. That's where protein supplements come in handy. You'll need two kinds. Whey Protein. Good to use pre and post workout, or any time as a small meal when you want to keep the carbohydrate content low. [    Diane: I like several different brands and rotate to keep from getting bored.     My favorites include, EAS Precision Protein, EAS Simply Whey, (a great price performer with great taste), Next Designer Whey (always a good taste choice for a beginner) and AST VP2. Richard: I like to get a good blend of the different Proteins including whey isolates and concentrate and caseins, so I choose Pro-blend 55.]  Meal Replacement Shakes. (MRPs) Use these for snack meals and for times when eating a real meal is impossible. Keep a shaker, a bottle of water and an MRP at your desk and in your car so you are always prepared. Personal favorites for both of us include one of the oldest, Met-RX, chocolate and EAS Myoplex Lite or regular Myoplex in Tropical flavors.  Keep protein bars on hand.  It's not always practical to whip out a shaker bottle to mix up an MRP, so protein bars are a great choice. Fat levels tend to be high, so keep that in mind when planning your day. Carbohydrate levels can be extremely high to the point where you just might be better off having a brownie, so please choose wisely. EAS makes a low-carb bar, advertised at 3 grams of carbs. Just remember, they're not counting the carbohydrates from glycerine, which takes the count up to around 20 grams. But, 20 is still a reasonable amount of carbs for a protein bar. Diane's favorite, EAS Low-Carb Strawberry and the new Detour bar, which can satisfy any craving for a Snickers. But, at 9 grams of fat and 290 calories, you better plan this snack carefully into your daily meal plan. Richard's favorite, EAS Advant Chewy Chocolate Chip, nice and cold right out of the refrigerator.  Now that your refrigerator and pantry are well stocked, let's examine putting these ingredients together into meals.  Breakfast:    Steel-cut oats, whey protein and blueberries  OR Egg white omelet, whole-wheat toast and melon  OR Oatmeal, cottage cheese, and strawberries*  Snack One:  Protein Bar OR MRP  OR Whey protein and small piece of fruit  OR Cottage cheese with fruit  OR  Yogurt with strawberries  Lunch:    Grilled chicken, beef or fish with salad and brown rice  OR Tuna on rye bread  OR Oven roasted turkey with sweet potato and green vegetables  Snack Two:   See snack one  Dinner:   Grilled chicken or fish with salad and green vegetables  Snack Three: (if needed)   Whey protein or cottage cheese  Portion size will need to be determined by you. Do you need to lose weight? Then you need to expend more calories than you take in. Is your goal to put on lots of lean, sexy muscle mass? Then, you may need to have seven or eight small meals per day, or keep the five to six meals per day with added calories at each meal.  What you should see from this guide is that there is plenty of lean protein, as well as a good amount of complex carbohydrates to provide the necessary fuel for daily activities, including your job and your training sessions. Taper carbohydrates down to low levels as the day goes on, as you will not need the same levels of fuel for sleeping as with your daily activities.  *Diane: Much to Richard's chagrin, my favorite breakfast is one that I have each day. I mix cottage cheese and cut up strawberries into my cooked oatmeal, then sprinkle with cinnamon and some Sweet 'n Low or Stevia. It's not pretty, but so good. Thanks to Western CT's busiest trainer, Trish Erwin for the breakfast tip.  Getting your nutrition in order takes planning! We won't kid you here. You are going to need to plan ahead and be prepared. Grill up a week's worth of chicken breasts and stick them in the freezer. Prepare several days worth of brown rice and store in throwaway containers. Place a container of rice and a chicken breast in a cooler with a piece of fruit, an individual container of cottage cheese and a protein bar and you've got several meals to eat on the go.  No time for breakfast in the morning? Cook up several days of steel-cut oats or cooked oatmeal and place in Ziploc containers. When mixed with cottage cheese, the oatmeal is great cold. Or try this novel idea?get up 20 minutes early and have a great breakfast of cooked eggs.  It's not easy, but you don't want to look like your peers, do you? It takes effort to have a legendary physique, and we are not looking to be like everyone else, we are looking for health, fitness, vitality, youthfulness and vibrancy.  Get your supplements in order! Our top three picks. Multi-vitamin Super-antioxidant Glutamine Want to take it a bit further? Vitamin C, E, B-complex Calcium One more step? BCAAs Creatine The list goes on and on with supplements. But, we are trying to give you an introductory sampling of possible supplements to add to your daily plan without overloading you. Depending upon the stresses you put on your body in terms of the intensity of your exercise programs will determine the levels of supplementation and the need for additional items not on the above list.  Everyone should check with their physician before adding supplements into their routine. This is critical for Baby boomers and all ages that are a bit overweight. Carrying excess pounds creates imbalances in the system, which makes it difficult for the body to metabolize the supplements properly. Diabetics should NOT use glutamine before checking with their physician and should check protein supplements carefully as many as now including glutamine.  Diane: Here's my glutamine tip. Since glutamine is a supplement that aids with recovery, I want it in my system at the moment I've completed my training session. So, I add a few grams of glutamine to my water bottle that I use during my cardio and resistance training sessions. And then post workout, I'll take a few more grams of glutamine. Try this method of supplementing with glutamine and let me know how it works for you.  Getting In Shape For This Summer Means Movement.  Let's start briefly with a discussion of cardiovascular exercise. Many more details will follow next week on cardio and resistance training.  If you need to shed bodyfat, you need to start moving. If you are brand new to exercise, start slow this week with walking, as walking is easy on the joints and can be done ANYWHERE! If you don't have a treadmill at home and it is cold and rainy where you live, hit the mall for a brisk 30-45 minute walk, five times this week. That's all you have to do. It's simple, it's free and doesn't require any equipment. For those of you lucky enough to live in warm climate get outside and go for a walk. Enjoy the outdoors!  Are you an intermediate or advanced level fitness buff that's already engaged in cardiovascular activity? Then try something new this week. If you are always strapped to a piece of equipment, get outdoors for a walk or bike ride. Go skiing or snowboarding in cold climates. Find an ice skating ring and really burn some calories. Movement is and can be fun, so go and enjoy.  Getting In Shape For This Summer Means Resistance Training!  Once again, much more on resistance training next time.  Are you brand new to weightlifting? Here are your assignments for the week Make the decision to join a gym or create a home gym Purchase your gym membership or equipment for home gym Hire a personal trainer for several sessions to learn about program design and the critical elements of proper technique Hit the bookstore.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babyboom28.htm,"Shaping Up For Summer, The Baby Boomer Way: Part 2!Click Here For Part One! Baby boomers! As promised, here's the second part of the Legendary Fitness plan to shape up for summer. Last week we focused on cleaning out the pantry, stocking up on nutrient dense foods, purchasing supplements and being prepared with protein bars and MRPs for times when a real meal is not possible. This week we turn our focus to the movement end of the Baby boomer shape up plan, cardiovascular exercise and resistance training.  ""Moving is fun,"" said Cat Smiley, Canadian Freestyle skier and host of the new radio talk show, Physically Tweaked, The Cat Smiley Show."" Diane: I had the good fortune to be a guest on this new fitness radio talk show where we talked about the current levels of obesity. So many people believe that cardiovascular activity is boring. But, it doesn't have to be. Just try skiing the Cat Smiley way, and you'll never again believe that cardio is boring. Cat's right! Movement is fun! Interested in hearing this fitness talk show? Check out, http://www.catsmiley.com/pages/635960/index.htm  Click To Enlarge! From skiing to blading, biking and tennis, dancing which served as John Grimek's cardiovascular exercise or running, you don't have to be tied to a piece of cardio equipment in the gym on a daily basis.  The point is to just start moving! How much movement you ask? Great question as this is an area of confusion.  Why is the amount of cardio needed so confusing? Because, there is so much conflicting information that it's hard to decide which advice to follow. The reason for the confusion is surprising, as the public is to blame for the differing information. In 1978 the American College of Sports Medicine recommended vigorous activity such as running, at least three times per week. But, recommendations were drastically scaled back in the 1990's when few were participating in rigorous activities that got their hearts revved up at least three times per week. As a result, intensity was replaced with moderation. Running and sprinting were replaced with brisk walking or gardening.  Boomers, we've discussed the physiological changes that occur after 40 in previous articles. One of the important factors is that the metabolism slows down after the age of 40. That means we need to either consume fewer calories or engage in activities where we burn more. If you want to have a legendary physique, you are going to have to work for it. Make it fun and it won't seem like work.  For all levels engaged in exercise activities, a proper warm-up is required. A moderate walk slowly increasing to a brisk walk for five to twenty minutes will do the trick. Use this walking warm-up before your cardio and resistance training.  Learning To Run. Beginner Cardio Routine Start by walking 3-5 times per week at a moderate pace At the end of the week, start increasing the speed or duration of the walk As your pace and endurance increase, begin interval training which is alternating between very fast and moderate levels of walking for a minute on, followed by a minute off Replace the fast walking with a slow jog and alternate between jogging and walking Increase the duration of the jog. Five minutes of jogging, followed by one minute of walking. Once again, increase the jog up to ten and then fifteen minutes. Reach twenty minutes of jogging and start interval training again, this time alternating between short bursts of running (faster than jogging) and a quick recovery jog. Increase the length of run time. You are now a runner! Some of you will progress through the stages quickly, while others will stay in each stage for several weeks. The point is to keep striving to make progress.  Some of you boomers are already suffering the wrath of Boomeritis with injuries that will not allow you to run. Follow the same routine with biking, working to increase speed, endurance or hill work, or if you must do your cardio in a gym use a recumbent bike or elliptical machine which tend to be easy on the joints.  Intermediate to advanced level running routine. Work to increase endurance by increasing the time of the run Add intensity to your running with interval training. Run sprints for 90 seconds, back off for 60-90 seconds at a moderate run and sprint again. 20-30 minutes of sprint intervals will increase your intensity and will burn many calories. Run sprints up a hill. Walk back down quickly. Boomers watch out for running downhill, as this can be hard on the knees. Intermediate and advanced runners already have their set number of running days per week. Try adding in variety with sprints, interval training or endurance running once per week.  Running can be hard on the knees so run on a track as often as possible. Also, replace your running shoes often. Check the inside of your shoes for wear, not just the outside. Running has wonderful benefits. It doesn't cost anything and provides an efficient means of burning many calories quickly. It also tends to remove the fat pockets from women's problem areas in the hips and thighs. Richard trained Laura Combes when she was crowned the first Ms. America. Running was a part of her routine to remove pockets of fat.  Getting In Shape For Summer Also Means Movement Through Resistance Training.  Beginning weight lifters had several tasks last week including the purchase of a gym membership or equipment for home use. You've done your warm-up and now it's time to begin with a simple circuit training routine. Use this routine for one to four weeks. You will do a full body workout, three times per week. Use fairly light weights so that you can get acclimated to lifting with proper technique and understand how to contract the working muscle, while relaxing others.  Diane: I can't stress enough, the importance of hiring a qualified trainer to teach you proper lifting techniques. Good form is important at all ages, but critical to us baby boomers that are struggling to remain injury free. Trust me on this one; some dollars spent now will save hundreds in medical deductibles later on.

Perform each exercise doing one set of 12-15 reps. If you are not too sore on Day Two, run through the circuit training routine a second time. Follow this advice on the third training day and you'll be running through this routine three times. When ready, it's time to move on to the intermediate routine.  Intermediate Resistance Training  Plan on four workout sessions per week, two for upper body and two for the lower body.

Day Five, repeat workout number one. Evaluate where you are in your periodization training and determine the intensity levels.  While training programs should be tailored towards individual needs, there are several key rules that should be followed by all lifters. Richard recently received an email that is full of questions many lifters share.  Question: 1. How do I increase my poundages?  2. When I try and lift heavy my form becomes bad, so how do I increase my poundages without compromising form.  3. Is it a better idea to lift a bit heavier weight and compromise on the form, or stick to a lower weight (which you have been doing for a couple of months).  4. If you do not increase your weight lifting capabilities, does this stunt muscle growth?  5. How often should one strive to lift heaver weights?  6. Is it a good idea help increase your poundage by taking help from the spotter right from the first rep?  7. How often should one switch between high wt/low rep and low wt/high rep, (is it necessary) or should one just stick to high weights?  I really hope you could help me with the above, as it has been affecting my workouts lately and was sure I could count on an experienced bodybuilder like you.  Tarun N. Answer:  Hi Tarun,  Progressive resistance is the premier principle in strength gains, yet each of us has different potentials. You should NEVER compromise form or you're setting yourself up for injury. You should NEVER (or rarely) do singles; they're just too dangerous, especially without an experienced spotter. The first thing you should do is pick a weight that you can do 6 or 8 repetitions with and work on doing more repetitions of that weight until you can do 10-12 repetitions with it.  Then you add weight until you are back down to 4-6 repetitions and work on doing more repetitions with that weight until you can do 10-12 repetitions with it, etc. You should progress on this simple scheme for years!  Spotters will only help if you only use them on the last repetition if you are lifting to momentary failure. They do no good if you're going to use them to lift the weight for you.  When you begin to experience sticking points here are several things you can do: 1) Take a short layoff and get lots of sleep and think about your diet; make sure you are providing your body with maximum recovery and nutrition and then come back to training with renewed enthusiasm.  2) Work in the power rack on the part of the motion that seems to stall (example: do partials by setting the pins so you are just working the portion of the lift that seems to be giving you problems).  3) Just do high reps (10-15) for a month or so to give your tendons and ligaments a break and build capillaries in the muscles and then go back to the heavier weights and lower reps You just can't keep gaining strength in a linear fashion forever. But these tips should help you achieve your potential.    Happy training,  Richard  For baby boomers of all levels trying to shape up for summer, you should have your training journals in place, logging workouts, cardio and nutrition on a daily basis. Whenever possible, log the information as it happens. It's so easy to forget that you had a MRP at 10 am when it's now twelve hours later.  Reading is motivational at all levels. As discussed last week, we are starting a book discussion group. Dave Draper's, Your Body Revival and Todor Bompa's, Serious Strength Training are our current picks for discussion in April.    Train hard, train smart and get in shape for summer!  Richard and Diane Last call!!! We've been hearing from you and are still gathering your thoughts and views on the current state of bodybuilding.

Baby Bumps And Barbells: How To Stay Fit When You're Pregnant
Assuming your doc gives you the green light, there’s no need to stop training and eating clean, healthy food when you’re pregnant. Here’s how.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/baby-bumps-and-barbells-how-to-stay-fit-when-pregnant.html,"Interest in the topic of weight gain during pregnancy has ballooned. On a recent pregnancy blog, I noticed many women supporting each other in their unhealthy cravings and overindulgences. In response to a picture of a heavy and pregnant Jessica Simpson, women wrote things like: ""If you are worried about your weight then, really, what kind of mother would you be?""""If you're craving something when you are pregnant, you should eat it because the baby wants it!""""It's the only time in a woman's life where weight gain is acceptable; you can wear elastic clothes while you grow!""As a personal trainer and fitness nutritionist, and as a woman who has very recently had a baby, this type of mentality saddens me. Throughout my pregnancy, I was eyed skeptically while I worked out. I heard, ""Don't you need to put on some weight?"" and, ""Aren't you over doing it?""I had to bring the woman who bore me to one of my doctor's appointments so she could hear for herself that my training and my healthy eating habits were not hurting her grandchild in the womb. Because I took such good care of my body, my journey through pregnancy was a breeze. I dodged symptoms that normally plague overweight and sedentary women. I sit here today, a week after giving birth, in my skinny jeans. I have six weeks of rest ahead of me, but I'm at peace with it because I feel phenomenal!There is little in the way of direction for pregnant women looking to stay fit. Most articles just throw in pictures of pregnant ladies holding a 5-pound dumbbell or smiling in yoga pants. There's a lot more to staying fit during pregnancy than just buying a mat a doing some stretches.I'd like to share my knowledge and experience to help pregnant women stay fit and healthy-you AND your baby will be better off with diet and exercise. We should approach these nine months of carrying another human being with more care and attention than we would at any other time! Training While Preggers If you would like to remain or begin working out during pregnancy, begin in the practitioner's office. Find out first what you are allowed to do. The most common restriction is keeping your heart rate down. My doctor told me to keep my heart rate below 140; that was problematic for me because I had to totally tone down my normal cardio routine. My running turned into trotting and became painfully boring. I was relieved when it came to my weight training because I could basically continue my normal routine. I just had to make a few tweaks: Grab dumbbells that you would normally use for a 12-15 rep range and use them for an 8-10 rep set. You're still lifting hard, but not getting your heart rate up too high for too long.After the first trimester, stay away from lying flat on your back whether you are doing abs or bench press. The uterus could potentially compress the vena cava, which may result in a reduced blood flow, leaving you dizzy or nauseated.Sometime during your pregnancy, Relaxin, a hormone that loosens ligaments to prepare your body for delivery, will kick in like a feisty fetus. When you feel it, back off your heavier or more difficult free-weight movements and drift more to the machines for more support and safety.Take your jogging cardio to the elliptical to prevent hip or knee pain.Listen to your body. Adjust your workout accordingly.Sample Workout    Day 1: Legs/Shoulders      Walking, Treadmill20 min on incline     Leg Extensions2 drop sets of 10,12,15 reps     Barbell Squat4 sets of 8-10 reps     Standing Leg Curl2 drop sets of 10,12,15 reps     Romanian Deadlift4 sets of 8-10 reps   Superset:   One Leg Barbell Squat3 sets of 12 reps     Barbell Lunge (Smith Machine)3 sets of 12 reps  Superset:   Arnold Dumbbell Press3 sets of 8-10 reps     Side Lateral Raise3 sets of 20 reps  Superset:   Smith Machine Overhead Shoulder Press3 sets of 8-10 reps     Side Lateral Raise3 sets of 20 reps  Superset:   Reverse Machine Flyes3 sets of 10-12 reps     Face Pull3 sets of 15 reps   quickstart_training_white(""Sample: Legs/Shoulders"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=Incline+walking,+treadmill:+20+min&Sets%5B%5D=1&Exercise%5B%5D=Leg+Extension:+2+drop+sets+of+10,12,15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Barbell+Squat:+4+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Standing+Leg+Curl:+2+drop+sets+of+10,12,15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Romanian+deadlift:+4+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Bulgarian+Squat:+3+sets+of+12+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Smith+Machine+Lunge:+3+sets+of+12+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Arnold+Press:+3+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Side+Lateral+Raise:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Smith+Machine+Overhead+Press:+3+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Side+Lateral+Raise:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Reverse+Machine+Flyes:+3+sets+of+10-12+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Cable+Face+Pull:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&TotalExercises=17&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=Abigail+Kluttz&name=Sample:+Legs/Shoulders"");Printable PagePDF DocumentEating While PreggersIt's a fact of creating new life: While you're pregnant, you're going to gain weight. Here's Why: on average, women gain 7.5 pounds for the baby, 1.5 pounds for the placenta, 2 pounds for the amniotic fluid, 2 pounds for uterine enlargement, 2 pounds for breast tissue, 2 pounds for blood volume, 4 pounds of fluid in maternal tissue, and 7 pounds of maternal fat stores for an average total of 30 pounds.To stay within that range, you're going to have to use some will-power and restriction. There's no need to satisfy every craving. If that were true, I would have spent my entire pregnancy eating Mexican food and frozen yogurt. Pregnancy does crazy things to your blood sugar, and it's your job to keep it regulated with healthy, clean foods, not Twinkies. Talk to your doctor about your healthy weight gain. Choose a diet plan that will ensure that you're getting the proper nutrients without empty calories:Keep your metabolism revved by eating every 2.5-3 hours. Take advantage of the thermogenic effect, meaning the energy you expend digesting food.Though protein powder labels may suggest not using protein while pregnant, my doctor said it hasn't been studied or tested thoroughly. I found that protein shakes were my best friend! They helped me through some first trimester morning sickness and supplemented my lifting with good calories and lean protein.The National Women's Center of Health recommends eating an extra 300 calories during the last 6 months of pregnancy. Don't add empty calories! Three hundred calories is a half cup of oatmeal and one scoop of protein powder, not an extra cheeseburger. While a clean, healthy diet is important, it's unhealthy to be on a calorie-deficit diet during pregnancy. I'm a 5'9"" figure competitor, and my clean eating plan comprised 2,000 calories per day: 185 carb grams, 170 protein grams and 62 essential fats grams. That might seem like a lot of food, but I was training and eating about 85% clean.Maintaining a good diet keeps your blood sugar from dropping and your waistline from getting bigger than it must. This will also put you on the right track for weight loss after your baby arrives. The healthier you are, the healthier your baby will be. My clean diet and exercise program helped me produce a 7-pound, 5-ounce baby. The chubby cheeks and rolls look amazing where they belong, on him, but not on the post-pregnancy mom!

After we walked through the gym doors, we went our separate ways. He hit the weight room and I continued to be a cardio bunny, which helped me progressively shed the baby weight. After a while, I felt thin and got bored of the same treadmill routine.When I saw Jamie Eason on Bodybuilding.com, I became inspired and intrigued by the fitness world. I told my boyfriend that I want a body like Jamie's and he explained that I wouldn't get it on the treadmill.I wanted to embark on a challenge that I'd never done. I desired to live my life with passion. I wanted to feel empowered and live a long, healthy life. I wanted to be an example of willpower to my daughter. I felt drawn in and excited. I knew this journey was meant to be, so I decided to run with it and gave it my all.

I was intrigued by the newfound lifestyle. The more knowledge I acquired the more motivated and determined I grew. I eliminated bread, sugars, alcohol, and fast food from my diet and started following Jamie Eason's meal plan. Instead of spending time on the treadmill, I headed for the weights with my man. He encouraged me, motivated me, and opened my eyes to the benefits of lifting heavy. I discovered that the cleaner I ate and the harder I trained, the better my progress was.Cool FactAs a food service specialist in the Army National Guard, Melody is  the only female in her unit that is airborne and air assault  qualified with record-breaking PT scores!When I had a taste of what my body was capable of, I decided to compete, so I picked a show and committed to it. Taking that step gave me the drive to push myself even harder. I wanted to be the best on stage and I refused to look like a fool. Committing to a competition was one of the best decisions I ever made. It helped me develop and strengthen my discipline and willpower.I look back and can't believe that I thought countless hours of cardio would help me obtain a dream body.

I had to build my strength and endurance. Last year, I could barely bench the bar or a pull-up. Be patient with your results, but push yourself without overdoing it.I always do an initial warm-up set with light weight on all exercises then do three working sets by increasing the weight for each set. I typically try to do 20-30 minutes of cardio every other day to get my blood pumping on the stairmaster, elliptical, incline treadmill, or stationary bike.

10 Baby Steps To Launch Your Motivation To Application!
Why do you want to exercise?  Is someone urging you to do so?  Do you want to do it for yourself?  Make sure you are working out because you want to. Here are ten baby steps to help you on your road to a healthier life. Try them now!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/10_motivation_baby_steps.htm,"Article Summary: Figure out why you want to change your life, and set up your goals. Design a workout program you'll like, and change it up if you don't. Gain support and knowledge from like-minded people.  1. Ask Yourself Why You Want To Do This  This is an important question and it needs to be asked first. Why do you want to exercise? Is someone urging you to do so? Do you want to do it for yourself? Make sure you are working out because you want to and not because someone wants you to.  Click To Enlarge.Why Do You Want To Exercise? If you aren't 100% committed to working out, you will be a portion of the 50% of people who stop exercising within the first 6 months of beginning a program.  2. Education  Read up on fitness and exercise. Grab some magazines and soak up as much knowledge as you can. You will find tons of articles on different workouts, diets, motivational tips, staying focused, and much more. Take that information and utilize it when you are making up your workout and diet plan.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ] In A Rut? Don't Just Sit There!   Some folks don't even realize they're in a rut, as they religiously plod along, training day after day, convinced that everything is fine... Well everything is not fine!   Author: Tim Wescott  When you find yourself in a rut or are lacking motivation, you can pull from the things you read and get yourself back on track. It's also important to learn a little about the human body and how it works. After all, wouldn't you want to know what's going on with your body when you exercise?  Learn how the body burns fat and what exercises work what muscles. Educating yourself about fitness will give you a greater appreciation of all the hard work you put in at the gym.  3. Join A Gym/Buy Equipment  Now that you have your plan in motion, it's time to figure out if you want to pay for a gym membership or build a home gym. Building a home gym makes fitting in a workout very convenient, but at the same time a lot of people blow it off because they are at home and are thinking about a million other things they need to be doing.  RELATED POLL Does Having A Home Gym Make You More Prone To Distraction Away From Exercise?  Yes. Maybe But The Convenience Is Worth The Risk. If You've Got Stuff At Home, It's Just As Hard To Hit The Gym. No If You're Commited Nothing Will Distract You.     If you decide to go with this option, start off with just the essentials such as some dumbbells, a bench, and a piece of cardio equipment. With a gym membership people see the money coming out of their account each month and feel obligated to go since they are paying for it. On the flip side, if you join a gym that is out of your way, then you might feel that you don't have enough time to drive over and still fit in everything you needed to get done during the day.  If you decide to go with the gym membership, be sure and find a location that is convenient to you and has all the amenities that you would want it to have. Read all the fine print before signing any paperwork to understand the terms and conditions of the contract.

Make sure each type of goal is obtainable and measurable. Your short term goals will lead you up to your long term goal. For instance, you could set a long term goal of losing 30 pounds in 6 months. You're short term goal could be to lose 5 pounds each month to obtain that.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Fail To Plan And You've Planned To Fail!

Set Up A Routine And Days To Exercise  Come up with a schedule and make sure you follow it. Schedule time to workout before or after work or even during lunch. Whatever you chose, make sure it fits into your schedule without being a huge inconvenience. If you can wake up an hour early to fit a workout in, then by all means do that.  If you don't mind giving up a lunch break to get in a quick cardio session or weights then go for it. Simply work it into your schedule and write down the days you want to do your weight training and/or cardio and stick with it. After no time you will get into the routine of doing it and you won't even need to write it down anymore.  BODYBUILDING.COM FORUM: SCHEDULE THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ] Busy Schedule...

Pick Things You Enjoy Doing  There are many different types of training styles and the great thing about it is that it gives you variety. If you don't like one training method, you always have another to try. And changing things up isn't always bad. It stimulates the muscles in ways that a previous workout didn't and can also help you break through a plateau.  If the treadmill isn't your thing then go for a jog in the park or in the woods if the outdoors is your thing. Into sports? Grab your friends and play a pick-up game of basketball or football. The key is to utilize things that you enjoy that you can use to your advantage to help you get in your workouts.  Click To Enlarge.Grab Your Friends And Play Some Basketball. 7. Create A Workout  Set up a workout program (or have a trainer do it for you) that fits your goals and what you want to achieve. Make sure you are hitting all muscle groups 1-3 times a week based on your goals. Just as important, make sure you have rest days in your routine to allow proper recovery from workouts.  You're workouts should take no more than 60 minutes and should flow. Have fun with your workout, if you are getting tired of the same routine or program then switch it up. Talk to a trainer and let him/her know what you enjoy doing and what you are looking for and allow them to use their expertise to create a customized program just for you.

Create A Nutrition Plan  Set up a nutrition plan. Notice how I said ""nutrition plan"" and not ""diet"". People despise the word ""diet"" so let's not use it here. You don't need to go all out and clean up everything about what you eat on a daily basis.  If you simply change out a couple things at a time you will realize that it isn't so bad and that you can substitute things you eat with healthier options without craving those ""bad"" foods.

BABY Steps To A Better Diet!
To achieve your goals in bodybuilding and/or fat loss, you must have a near perfect diet. Eating should be viewed as something that is not just a side part of bodybuilding, but a major part of it.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babystep.htm,"Make the change as easy on yourself as possible for success! Admit it. Yes, I am talking to you. Your diet is not perfect and if you are like most people, it is far from it. You know that cherry cheesecake that you ate right BEFORE dinner was not a good idea, but what else goes good with pizza and beer?  Diet is Very Important  To achieve your goals in bodybuilding and/or fat loss, you must have a near perfect diet. Eating should be viewed as something that is not just a side part of bodybuilding, but a major part of it. The truth is that you can't get half the results no matter what workout program you are following if your diet is a stinker. There are no two ways about it. Okay, so what do you do about it? Empty all your current food out of your cupboards and refrigerator into the trash and replace it with tofu? Don't worry, it does not have to be that hard. The easiest way to acheive your goal of perfect nutrition is to take BABY Steps. The main idea of BABY Steps is that you slowly replace the bad foods that you are currently eating with better foods. The change will be so small each week that you won't even notice it. All you will notice is the ripped abs and huge biceps that suddenly came out of hiding! Use BABY Steps Follow these example BABY Steps to get you started: Drink skim milk. Ugh! Skim milk is sick... right? If you are currently drinking whole or 2% milk, you probably think so. It is just too hard for you to drink white water. Understand that by drinking even 1/2% milk over skim milk gives the average person hundreds or thousands of extra grams of fat per year! This can add up to extra pounds of fat each year! It has to go somewhere... Make it easy on yourself. If you are drinking whole milk right now, immediately move down to 2% milk. The first week or so you may notice the taste difference a little, but your body and tastebuds will adapt. You will enjoy 2% just as much as you used to like whole milk. I promise you that this is true! Give it a chance for two weeks. After a few weeks or a month of 2% milk, switch to 1%. Wait until you are used to it, then change to 1/2% and then to skim milk. This little change in your diet can make a huge difference in your body in just a few months. Skim milk has all the same protein and vitamins as whole milk, but without the fat. Cut the sugar! Sugar is the evil nutrient just waiting to turn you into a fat blob. These days, there is no excuse to consume a large amount of sugar. With stevia, aspartame and all the other sugar substitutes that taste great and have been proven to be safe, you can still satisfy your sweet tooth. The main place that sugar is hiding is in soda. It is easy to get addicted to this stuff. Right now, make a vow that you will NEVER drink another regular soda again... no matter what! Switch to diet soda. ""But diet is so sick!"", you say. Just give it a few weeks. I used to say the same exact thing a year ago. I drank soda each and every meal and loved it. I switched to diet when my bloated stomach asked me to. It was not great at first, but at least it was better than water. After a few weeks, I HONESTLY could not tell the difference between regular and diet! My tastebuds adapted and I haven't had a regular coke since. I don't miss it or the sugar and calories at all. I saved myself at least 1000 calories per week just by making this small change in my diet. Once you are used to the changes you made above, it is time for the next step. Note: The next sentence may freak you out. Completely cut ALL pizza and burgers out of your diet. Okay... breathe. It is going to be okay. We can do this together. In fact, you should make a pact with one of your diet buddies that you will help the other stick to it. Pizza and burgers are just about the worst things you can eat. The problem is that they are SO convenient! On every corner there is a pizza or burger joint just a smell away. Studies have shown that one of the main reasons so many Americans are obese is because they constantly eat fast food. Cutting out all fast food would be ideal, but usually not practical on a quick lunch or dinner. There are healthier selections on the menu at most places. As long as you completely avoid pizza and burgers, you are on the right track. The cool thing about the human body is that it adapts quickly. You LEARN to crave fattening food like pizza and burgers. You can also UNLEARN it. After a few weeks without it, you won't miss it as much... then not at all. Ask any healthy bodybuilder. It's Easy and It Works These are just a few steps you can take. You know what bad foods you eat too much of that need to be slowly cut out. If cutting out a certain food is too hard, make a deal with yourself to only eat it once per week. Cheating is okay! In fact, it can help you stick to your diet in the long term. After a year of slowly cutting out and/or reducing the bad foods and replacing them with healthier ones, your diet will have made a 180 degree change... and you won't even have noticed it! So many people say that starting today, they are going to eat perfect. Almost always, they do pretty well for about a week and then give up. The change is too drastic and they can't do it. By following the BABY Steps plan, you will change your diet effortlessly and your body will thank you for it."

Knowing that she needed to lose weight and required help, Margaret entered a ""7 Month Work Out Program"" hosted by a local gym and sports program where she was given a free gym membership to Powerhouse Gym in Little Rock, Arkansas and personal training sessions with the gym owner, Jeff Lawrence.

Training    Circuit training in a 12 station circuit, 3 times per week initially did not produce enough of a restrictive caloric environment to result in weight loss on the scale.

Here's what Margaret has to say about her transformation.  ""I haven learned how to eat, exercise and take care of myself. I feel better than I ever have. I hope that I have encouraged others.

Karen Traded Baby Weight For Lifting Weights!
Karen didn't let the price of a big-box gym scare her off. She built a kettlebell gym in her garage and lost 100 pounds!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/karen-traded-baby-weight-for-lifting-weights,"Vital StatsName: Karen ConwayLocation: Menifee, CAStaying healthy wasn't difficult for Karen Conwayat least, not back when she was growing up in a family that made it a priority to make healthy choices. ""When I was living at home with my parents, we had balanced meals,"" she says. ""Fruits, veggies, proteinsI was very used to that."" Karen admits that her own snacking habits weren't always the best, but having healthy influences around her help curb cravings. ""Just by having fresh groceries available, I found myself reaching for fruits and veggies a lot of the time,"" she recalls.But when Karen went out on her own, she found the temptation of unhealthy food impossible to resist. She gained weight during college, and then more weight during her two pregnancies. Karen tipped the scale at 230 pounds before a realization hit her like an explosion: She was extremely unhappy and felt like she was trapped in someone else's body. Something had to change, but she was the only one who could make it happen. This is Karen's story. How did college kick off your weight gain? To be honest, it all boiled down to laziness. I had the dorm-food meal plan, and while the options weren't always the healthiest, there were still options. Nevertheless, I still went for the refined carbsthe pizza, french fries, and cereal. Add to that the late-night study sessions and alcohol, and it led to me treating my body very badly. By the time I graduated, I'd turned my ""freshman 15"" into the ""freshman 25."" Before 228 lbs.After 127 lbs.Age: 29  Height: 5'3""  Weight: 228 lbs.  Body Fat: 69%Age: 30  Height: 5'3""  Weight: 127 lbs.  Body Fat: 24.5% Did you exercise during your college years or afterward? I was completely sedentary in college. My ""workout"" consisted of walking around my college campus. I never visited the gym and wasn't into any sports. Then I maintained that excess 25 pounds for the next eight years. I had my first child and gained an additional 40 pounds, pushing me into the 200s. After my first child was born, I lost some weight, but baby number two quickly changed that. I gained nearly 60 poundswhen she was born, I weighed nearly 220 pounds.Lots of women gain some weight during pregnancy. Why did this hit you so hard? I think I took the idea of ""eating for two"" way too seriously. Today, after both my pregnancies, I know that you only need to eat an extra 300-500 calories a day, but I'd say I was consuming an extra 1,000-2,000 from bad food. I had a huge sweet tooth, and I just went for it with everything from chocolate ice cream to lemonade. With my second pregnancy, I was much more aware of how much weight I could gain, so I tried to be more healthy and active. I still gained during my second pregnancy. Looking back, I ""enjoyed"" my pregnancies a little too much. What was your turning point? The beginning date of my weight loss and fitness transformation was January 1, 2015, but losing weight wasn't my resolution per se. Many people reference some sort of ""aha"" moment they had when beginning their weight-loss or fitness journey, like seeing themselves in a picture or not being able to fit into clothing. For me, it really wasn't like that.I just remember being so angry with myself. I felt lost and trapped inside. I was trying to tell my husband that it felt like I was inside someone else's skinthat my outside was no longer me. I felt like I was wearing a mask. It was hard for my husband to understand, because he's one of those people who is over 6 feet tall, lean, and can eat whatever he wants. He didn't fully understand how I was feeling, which made it all the more frustrating. I was angry that I let it get to that place, and that I didn't stop and turn things around sooner. Why did you choose January 1 to begin your transformation? I definitely wasn't like, 'New Year, new me' or anything like that. It was a lot less ceremonious. I just thought I'd try making some changes for one day and see how it went. One day turned into two. That turned into a week, and then a month. I was tracking my diet on MyFitnessPal and seeing my streak add up, which was really motivating. It was so exciting to be able to tell my husband something like, ""Look, it's been 45 days!"" How has your husband helped along the way? He's been my biggest supporter. He constantly encourages me to do whatever it takes to be happy and healthy, and he even adjusted the way he cooks to fit my needs. He's not a runner, but when I was scared to do my first 5K, he signed up to do it with me. Through it all, he's always been by my side. How did you change your diet in the beginning? Initially, I just concentrated on cutting back to reasonable portions and figuring out what healthy portions of different foods actually look like. To be as accurate as possible, I bought a food scale and logged all my food into MyFitnessPal. As I went along, it started to click that eating healthier means eating more. I could eat a whole plate of broccoli instead of just a few crackers. It didn't take too long to learn that better choices sometimes meant more food, which meant feeling fuller. What does your diet look like now?

Upon waking/pre-workout Whey protein 42 gPre-workout 3/4-1 scoop  Post-workout L-Carnitine 1 servingPB2 powdered peanut butter 12 gWhen did you get serious about training? Exercise came into play a couple months after I changed my diet. I began by walking around my neighborhood pushing my giantand heavydouble stroller. It was hard, at first, but I really grew to look forward to getting out of the house, taking in the fresh air, and feeling a different sense of accomplishment that I hadn't known in so long. The first month I started walking, I lost an extra 10 pounds. It was nothing crazy or intensejust a 30- or 40-minute walk with the kids in their stroller. At that point, I was already losing about 10 pounds a month just from the changes in my diet, so I remember being blown away by how much more weight I lost with just a little bit of exercise. I was immediately motivated to start adding more exercise to my day. My enjoyment snowballed, and by the fourth month, I was waking up before dawn to make time to run before obligations took over. It became a priority, and I became addicted. As I continued to learn about running and fitness in general, I started cross-training. How did lifting become part of your routine? I had a Groupon for two months of sessions at a local gym, and since the gym was new, the group classes I was signing up for often turned out to be private lessons with me and the instructor. He helped me build a foundation by teaching me form and technique, and he really educated me a lot about kettlebells. When my Groupon ran out, I couldn't afford a gym membership, so I bought my own set of kettlebells and now I work out at home in a mini gym in our garage. What do your workouts look like now?

I binge-watched all of the kettlebell-exercise videos on the site.Once I saw all those videos, I started exploring the rest of the site. I got addicted to transformation articles, and then I set up my BodySpace account and started tracking my goals. It's been a great resource.

Body Transformation: Kristin Bounced Back After Babies
Kristin was more determined than ever to ditch the post pregnancy weight and strut her stuff on stage. Read on to see how she not only competed but took 1st overall!

When I was pregnant with my second child, I decided that I was not going to be believe the ""hype"" that your body changes forever after having kids. I was determined to look better than ever after my second child, so I hired a trainer when I was 20 weeks pregnant, picked a show and went to work.   Oh, baby. How's this for a post-pregnancy body?How I Did ItSince I was pregnant when I began training, I made sure I had a trainer who knew how to work with expecting women. I followed a clean, healthy diet during the remainder of my pregnancy along with a weight training and cardio program. I was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy weight and preserve lean muscle in the process. After my son was born, I was able to start lifting heavier and doing more intense cardio which really helped to transform my body. Since I breastfed for the first 7 months I had to make sure to eat a super clean, but also a balanced diet. After I stopped breastfeeding I started my competition diet which consisted of high protein and carbohydrates with limited fat. I focused on heavy lifting, plyometrics, and high intensity interval training for my workouts. My first competition was in April 2011, just 9 months after my having my baby. I won my class and overall figure! I competed again in May 2011 and won overall figure in that show as well! I look forward to many more competitions in the future but I am enjoying my off-season to take time to work on my problem areas (abs and glutes - of course!) and spend time with my family.

Day 7: Rest Suggestions To OthersA lot of people think that bodybuilding/figure is a sport that is all about vanity. I have found this entire experience to be so amazing and I cannot think of any sport that requires 24/7 dedication like I have experienced. The friends that I have made and the people that I have met have been incredibly supportive and helpful. There is so much more to bodybuilding than what happens ""on stage."" That is a small part of the whole process.As a Sports Medicine Chiropractor I honestly and truly believe in nutrition and exercise as the foundation for overall health. I have had two amazing trainers (Jason Rulo during pregnancy and Autumn Edwards post-partum) who completely understand the physiology involved in nutrition and training.My biggest piece of advice for anyone getting into this sport is to find an expert who has experience and knowledge of the body. Too many women go on ""hard core"" diets and spend hours in the gym every day trying to be ""stage ready."" This will result in destroying the metabolism, the thyroid, and the self-esteem. There is no trophy or ""title"" in the world worth that!My experience has been nothing short of amazing! It was a lot of hard work, but I never felt that I compromised my health. My trainers always knew how to build my confidence, even when I had ""problem areas"" that needed attention (which clearly I did just having a second c-section!). They knew that this sport is just as much mental and physical and always worked to build my confidence which, in retrospect, helped my overall presentation onstage. I truly believe that in this sport, more than any other, you need a trainer who is experienced, knowledgeable, and most importantly is your biggest fan and cheerleader! I was blessed to have those people in my life and want nothing other than to be an inspiration to others.You Could Be Our Next Transformation Of The Week Male Transformations.

Baby Steps To A Better Body!
This is a short article on how to slowly work into living a healthier life and keeping fat off.  Read on to learn more...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/other32.htm,"Admit it. Yes, I am talking to you. Your diet is not perfect and if you are like most people, it is far from it. You know that cherry cheesecake that you ate right BEFORE dinner was not a good idea, but what else goes good with pizza and beer?   Diet Is Very Important   To achieve your goals in bodybuilding and/or fat loss, you must have a near perfect diet. Eating should be viewed as something that is not just a side part of bodybuilding, but a major part of it. The truth is that you can't get half the results no matter what workout program you are following if your diet is a stinker. There are no two ways about it.  Okay, so what do you do about it? Empty all your current food out of your cupboards and refrigerator into the trash and replace it with tofu? Don't worry, it does not have to be that hard. The easiest way to acheive your goal of perfect nutrition is to take BABY Steps.  The main idea of BABY Steps is that you slowly replace the bad foods that you are currently eating with better foods. The change will be so small each week that you won't even notice it. All you will notice is the ripped abs and huge biceps that suddenly came out of hiding!   BABY Steps   Follow these example BABY Steps to get you started:  Milk  Drink skim milk. Ugh! Skim milk is sick... right? If you are currently drinking whole or 2% milk, you probably think so. It is just too hard for you to drink white water. Understand that by drinking even 1/2% milk over skim milk gives the average person hundreds or thousands of extra grams of fat per year! This can add up to extra pounds of fat each year! It has to go somewhere...    Make it easy on yourself. If you are drinking whole milk right now, immediately move down to 2% milk. The first week or so you may notice the taste difference a little, but your body and tastebuds will adapt. You will enjoy 2% just as much as you used to like whole milk. I promise you that this is true! Give it a chance for two weeks.  After a few weeks or a month of 2% milk, switch to 1%. Wait until you are used to it, then change to 1/2% and then to skim milk. This little change in your diet can make a huge difference in your body in just a few months. Skim milk has all the same protein and vitamins as whole milk, but without the fat.  Sugar  Cut the sugar! Sugar is the evil nutrient just waiting to turn you into a fat blob. These days, there is no excuse to consume a large amount of sugar. With stevia, aspartame and all the other sugar substitutes that taste great and have been proven to be safe, you can still satisfy your sweet tooth.  The main place that sugar is hiding is in soda. It is easy to get addicted to this stuff. Right now, make a vow that you will NEVER drink another regular soda again...no matter what! Switch to diet soda. ""But diet is so sick!"", you say. Just give it a few weeks. I used to say the same exact thing a year ago. I drank soda each and every meal and loved it.    I switched to diet when my bloated stomach asked me to. It was not great at first, but at least it was better than water. After a few weeks, I honestly could not tell the difference between regular and diet! My tastebuds adapted and I haven't had a regular soda since. I don't miss it or the sugar and calories at all. I saved myself at least 1000 calories per week just by making this small change in my diet.  Pizza & Burgers  Once you are used to the changes you made above, it is time for the next step. Completely cut ALL pizza and burgers out of your diet.  Calculate your estimated daily calorie intake... Okay... breathe. It is going to be okay. We can do this together. In fact, you should make a pact with one of your diet buddies that you will help the other stick to it.  Pizza and burgers are just about the worst things you can eat. The problem is that they are SO convenient! On every corner there is a pizza or burger joint just a smell away. Studies have shown that one of the main reasons so many Americans are obese is because they constantly eat fast food.    Cutting out all fast food would be ideal, but usually not practical on a quick lunch or dinner. There are healthier selections on the menu at most places. As long as you completely avoid pizza and burgers, you are on the right track.  The cool thing about the human body is that it adapts quickly. You LEARN to crave fattening food like pizza and burgers. You can also UNLEARN it. After a few weeks without it, you won't miss it as much... then not at all. Ask any healthy bodybuilder. What Are Your Goals? >Lose Fat >Build Muscle >Improve Energy >Other    It's Easy & It Works   These are just a few steps you can take. You know what bad foods you eat too much of that need to be slowly cut out. If cutting out a certain food is too hard, make a deal with yourself to only eat it once per week. Cheating is okay! In fact, it can help you stick to your diet in the long term.  After a year of slowly cutting out and/or reducing the bad foods and replacing them with healthier ones, your diet will have made a 180 degree change... and you won't even have noticed it! So many people say that starting today, they are going to eat perfect. Almost always, they do pretty well for about a week and then give up. The change is too drastic and they can't do it. By following the BABY Steps plan, you will change your diet effortlessly and your body will thank you for it."

Beginning Weight Training For Baby Boomers!
So, what's a Baby boomer to do that wants to achieve a high physique goal at a gym that only employs young clip-board trainers?  Follow our Legendary Fitness advice to create your own legendary physique!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babyboom56.htm,"Beginning Weight Training For Baby Boomers Many Baby Boomer readers contact us each week seeking information about designing a resistance training program that takes into account their special needs. Far too often, our readers are discouraged by twenty-something-year-old ""trainers"" with perfect physiques that have never experienced age-related metabolic slowdowns and/or injuries and impingements that are often part of daily life for those of us born before the 1960's.  So, what's a Baby boomer to do that wants to achieve a high physique goal at a gym that only employs young clip-board trainers? Follow our Legendary Fitness advice to create your own legendary physique!   Diane's Training Recommendations   Richard and I share many of the same beliefs about training and the aging process. We both acknowledge the need for increased recovery time and the need for periodization training to maximize growth while minimizing the risks of injury.    All About Recovery!  Below I will discuss some secrets that I use with my athletes. When talking about recovery from training and competition, there are basically 5 areas to focus on.  [ Click here to learn more. ] However, we each take a different approach to training a new client. With this in mind, we are each presenting our favorite beginning workout routine for a healthy, injury-free 40-year-old client. What Are Your Goals? >Lose Fat >Build Muslce >Improve Energy >Other  Most clients that are over the age of 40 are interested in adding muscle and losing weight. While it is very difficult for advanced level gym rats to achieve significant gains in muscle mass while losing weight, most beginners can achieve both goals at the same time.  Cardiovascular exercise will be utilized to burn calories, while the resistance training builds lean muscle mass which provides a natural boost to the metabolism.  My favorite beginning routine alternates three days of cardio with three days of resistance training each week to provide the beginning gym member with a balanced approach to physique transformation.  Beginners should set a goal of thirty minutes of cardiovascular exercise, three times per week. Add five minutes to your cardio routine each week, until you reach 45 minutes.  Treadmill walking, recumbent bikes, elliptical machines and outdoor biking are all great examples of cardiovascular exercise that will take you toward your physique goals. Changing your mode of cardio exercise each session helps relieve boredom and will be beneficial in achieving long-term goals.  Resistance training routines will be utilized on alternating days, working each body part once per week. This will allow plenty of time for recovery and eliminates the need to graduate from a circuit training routine to full-blown weight training.  In my favorite workout plan for beginners, you will be using primarily dumbbells and barbells, as they do not force the lifter into a predetermined range of motion that has been designed to fit the model physique used to design the machine. In essence, you'll learn to be a lifter at your very first training session!  Things To Know As A New Gym Member!  Please work with a nationally certified trainer to learn to properly execute the movements. The investment in a good trainer will help prevent training related injuries that like to find their way into a baby boomer body.   Diane was recently nominated to the National Board of Fitness Experts (www.NBFE.org) where she is involved in the design of the first National Board certification exams for personal trainers to create a national standard for trainers. Look for more information in an upcoming article that discusses hiring a qualified trainer, soon!   Do NOT be intimidated by advanced trainers. Everyone was a beginner at one time.

Day 6   30 Minutes Cardio    Brisk, Outdoor Walk   Richard's Training Recommendations   I actually start everyone, no matter what their age, on the same routine (unless, of course, I have to take into account injuries that need to be worked around). Before I begin to outline the beginning routine, let me point out some important first principles:   The first goal is to learn to perform the exercises in good form. If you ignore proper form, you may, no WILL, do damage to your muscles, tendons and ligaments.    The second goal is to overload your muscles without getting sore. It is my opinion that if you become very sore, you have done too much. Any time you do anything new, you will experience some soreness, but it should be minimal. Therefore, I always start my clients out extremely slowly the first three weeks. By twelve weeks, my clients are outperforming those who began by copying an advanced routine.  The third goal is to learn persistence. Do not get discouraged when the strength gains begin to slow down to an almost negligible degree. You must realize that those early strength gains on the bench press or barbell curls are not really strength gains. Your brain must develop the motor pathways to coordinate the action of stabilizer muscles, synergistic muscles, and the primary muscles necessary to move the weights in these strange, new paths.  As your brain learns to engage the proper muscles at the proper times to move the weights through those paths, it only appears that you are getting stronger. It is only after these skill patterns are established that true strength gains occur. This is only one of many reasons that you should NOT, under any circumstances, engage in any ""high intensity"" or ""heavy duty"" training. High intensity training is absolutely dangerous for the beginner.    Form For Fitness: Are You Using Proper Form?  What is the correct way to train, and how do you sort through so much information, some of it apparently conflicting? While it would be impossible to discuss all aspects of proper form for every possible exercise, this article will try to address...  [ Click here to learn more. ] I begin the first session by weighing, measuring, and photographing my clients. This provides baseline measurements and a visual record from which to determine progress.  Then I determine the clients strength level in any particular movement by determining the maximum amount of weight the client can lift for one repetition in each of the exercises; this is called the one-repetition maximum or 1-RM.  Since I am going to have them perform 10 repetitions of each exercise, I just take 75-80% of the 1-RM for each of the exercises to determine the beginning amount of weight to use.  I believe beginners should perform three full body workouts per week for the first three months. This provides frequent stimulation with adequate time for recuperation for maximum hypertrophy. The first week, then, consists of the following workout:   Week 1 Abs: Crunches 1-20 repetitions.   Quadriceps: 30? Leg extensions, 10 repetitions Leg Biceps: Leg curls, 10 repetitions Calves: Standing heel raises, 10 repetitions Back: Wide grip pull downs, 10 repetitions Chest: Bench press, 10 repetitions Shoulders: Dumbbell side raises, 10 repetitions Triceps: Pushdowns, 10 repetitions Biceps: Dumbbell Curls, 10 repetitions   Click here for printable workout log!   Weeks 2 & 3   For week two and three, I add one set of 10 repetitions, adding weight where possible.  On week four, I drop the sets to two per exercise and add an exercise so that the client is doing the following program:   Week 4 Abs: Crunches 1-20 repetitions.   Leg raises 1X10   Quadriceps:  30? Leg extensions, 2X10 Squats 2X 10  Leg Biceps:  Lying leg curls, 2X10  Seated leg curls 2X10  Calves:  Standing heel raises, 2X10 Seated heel raises, 2X10  Back:  Wide grip pull-downs, 2X10 Low cable rows, 2X10  Chest:  Bench press, 2X10 Pec dec, 2X10  Shoulders:  Dumbbell side raises, 2X10 Dumbbell presses, 2X10  Triceps:  Pushdowns, 2X10 Dumbbell French presses, 2X10  Biceps:  Barbell curls, 2X10 Dumbbell Curls, 2X10   Click here for printable workout log!   Weeks 5 & 6   Week 5 and 6 are the same: I just add a third set of 10 repetitions to each of these exercises.  The last three months of beginning training are devoted to increasing strength on each movement and attempting to adjust the rep schedule that fits the physiology of the client. The degree of concentration, dedication, persistence, and drive as well as their stated goals determine how I will move the client into an intermediate stage.  You may be saying, ""Wait a minute! There's no cardio here!"" Yep. People generally come to me to change the shape of their body and to get them into good exercise habits. Those two things are my first priority.  If I do suggest cardio, I let them pick the form it will take and advise them to begin with 15 minutes three times the first week alternating days of cardio with the resistance training so that they are not done on the same day.    CARDIOlternatives - Make Your Cardio Fun!  Cardio is not just about running and using cardio machines, it is about participating in ideas that get your heart rate up. Let me provide you with some CARDIOlternatives to enhance your cardio workouts.  [ Click here to learn more. ] I then have them add 15 or 20 minutes the second week so that they are doing 30-35 minutes three times a week. I will usually instruct females to begin cardio rather early on, because females have slower metabolisms than males and almost always need to do cardio to get rid of some of that fat.  The problem most of the people I train have is that they are usually either very busy students or professionals who have limited time to devote to training. It takes about 6 months to get people into the habit of working out so that it becomes as necessary to them as brushing their teeth.  Therefore, my main concern with beginners is getting them into a routine that will provide maximum results in as little time as possible. My goal is to motivate them to establish a new lifestyle that includes a healthier diet. Diet is MUCH more important than cardio for fat loss. Get the diet right and the fat will go.  It will go more quickly with cardio, but I've watched too many people stay fat while doing hours of exercise every day. My clients, therefore, immediately begin to keep a food journal in which they record EVERYTHING that goes down their throat except water.  I tell them NOT to change anything in their eating habits until after the first two weeks. After I study their eating patterns, I make the smallest changes I can that I think will lead to the fastest results.    The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective Nutritional Programs!  Take a look around the nutrition world. Confusing, isn't it? Dozens of nutrition experts are rising to prominence. Part of the problem is that much of the information hasn't reached the people who need it. Learn why...  [ Click here to learn more. ] I keep a journal of every exercise, set, rep, and weight as well as the weight training principles I explain each day and turn it over to the client at the end of the first 3 months.  By then my clients have become familiar with the basic principles of gaining and losing weight, building strength, proper form of the basic exercises that work the entire body, the basic terms of resistance training, and what to eat and not eat to contribute to building their own legendary physique.  Well, there you have it. Two approaches that Richard and Diane have used to introduce beginners to the wonderful joys of resistance training.

A New Father's Guide To Fitness
Everyone's heard horror stories about the challenges of staying healthy and sane with a new baby in the house. Use this unique opportunity to take a systematic approach to the timeless challenges facing your fitness plans.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/a-new-fathers-guide-to-fitness.html,"Vital StatsName: Vince Del Monte Height: 6'0"" Weight: 205 lbs Occupation: WBFF professional fitness model, personal trainer, and author Website: vincedelmontefitness.com Facebook: vincedelmontelivelargetvYou may recognize this guy. He stumbles out of bed feeling as though he hasn't slept. That's because he hasn't. He doesn't have the time for a real breakfast so he hits the drive thru for a breakfast McFatty. By 3 p.m. he's ready to faceplant on his desk. Hoping for some energy, he resorts to a designer coffee or a cola from the vending machine.He plans to hit the gym after work, but by the time he leaves the office, he's exhausted and starving. His wife is just as exhausted, so he picks up some Chinese takeout and heads home. In the last two months, he hasn't had a shower that lasted more than five minutes or slept for more than four hours straight. He used to curl 80 pounds, but he's down to curling 10, for however many reps it takes to change a wet diaper.Yep, he's a new father. You may even be him. I had no intention of being him when my wife gave birth to our precious baby girl during a hot summer day last August. Nine months later, I can say I narrowly escaped being him, but only because I planned ahead, took some positive steps, and had a great deal of help with some of the biggest health and fitness challenges of my life.I learned a lot during the process, and I want to share what I've learned with anyone else who is expecting a new child, whether it's your first or your fourth.""Becoming a father is huge game-changer.""The Same ... But DifferentBecoming a father is huge game-changer. Life is no longer about Vince's workouts, Vince's food, Vince's business, Vince's movies, and Vince's trips. After having a baby, it's no longer about me at all.Becoming a father is incredibly challengingeven more so if you're also trying to gain or maintain lean muscle and eat healthfully. But despite what you'll hear from some people, being a new Dad doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your own health and physique. In fact, by incorporating these tips into your life, being a new Dad may be one of the best things that could happen to your fitness goals.Think of it this way: The challenges you faced before having a father are the same ones you'll face now: Sleep and stress, diet, focus, accountability and time. But you'll experience them in an entirely new way.Challenge 1 Sleep and StressShortly after my daughter was born, I had the Koenigsberg test done to check my adrenal gland function, because I was eating in a caloric deficit but couldn't lose any fat. I was exhausted and stressed, and it wasn't much of a surprise to learn that my adrenal function was at an all-time low.Vince DelMonte 5 Tips To Improve Your Sleep Quality Watch The Video - 6:17  Stress, lack of sleep, and the stress caused by lack of sleep will wreak havoc on your hormone levels and throw them completely out of whack. When that happens, you'll be fatigued, you'll start to gain fator just store fat like I wasbecause of high cortisol levels. Pretty quickly, you'll find your testosterone levels will be too low to continue adding muscle.This is the point in article where I'd usually tell you to sleep more. Unfortunately, in the first weeks or even months after the baby is born, sleep is going to be a prize, not a guarantee. You may be one of the lucky fathers whose baby starts sleeping through the night almost immediately, but the odds are that you'll be getting up at least once each night for a changing or feeding.Are My Hormones Trying to Tell Me Something?The adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, are one of the first bodily systems to respond to declining health, particularly in response to stress, lack of sleep, or insufficient nutrition.By measuring the chloride levels in your urine, the Koenigsburg Adrenal Test gives a window into how effectively your adrenals are producing the hormone aldosterone, which regulates the body's salt, potassium, and water balance. Alternately, you could get cortisol or androgen levels tested, either by blood or saliva, to see if you have a hormone imbalance or deficiency.Do this through your doctor's office (recommended) or by purchasing a direct-to-consumer test online. Expect to pay between $30 and $125 for a test.I don't consider letting my wife deal with the late nights on her own an option, and neither will you. Simply accept that you're going to have interrupted sleep and irregular sleep patterns for a while and try to counter it one of two ways:Going to bed earlierGetting up laterBecause I have a business to run, and because I like getting a jump on the day, I started going to bed earlier. In fact, I go to bed earlier now than I did when I was young enough to be told to go to bed. I'm in bed by 9:30 each night and wide awake at 6 a.m., and it's actually quite an empowering feeling. I can still get around eight hours of sleep, even if it isn't all at once.Because my body and my health are a priority, I'm fine with missing nights in front of the television or working late on projects. In the meantime, my adrenal glands are now functioning as they should and I have a lot more energy to devote to burning fat and gaining muscle.Challenge 2 DietEating a healthy diet and hitting all your macros is challenging at any time, but even more so when you have a new baby in the house. If your wife usually does most of the food shopping and cooking, she probably won't be able to take care of you to the degree she used to. She shouldn't be expected to either. Even if you normally share the kitchen duties, prep time is now at a premium and will be for quite a while, and it's so easy to fall into the trap of ordering out or nuking your meals. But this is a dangerous road to fat gain and poor health.One of the best things I've ever done for my body and my family was to spend a chunk of money on cooking lessons with a chef. I learned how to cook meals in bulk so I could always have healthy meals that taste good and cover all my macros. I have to say, I've cooked some seriously good food and the meals were easy-on-the wallet and 10 times more delicious than my old bodybuilding meals. Learning how to cook in bulk had such a huge impact on my energy, health, and body that I made it the focus of the latest season of my online series, Live Large TV. I'll share some of what I learned in my next article for Bodybuilding.com.Improving my kitchen skills rescued my health and restored my energy levels, but it also saved me a huge amount of time and money. Every day after I have my first meal and get my workout in, I set aside an hour to cook all of our meals for that day and sometimes the next. Believe me, you can cook up to a week's worth of food in about the same time you cook a days worth of food when life is really busy. Having nutrient-dense foods ready to eat at any given time is absolutely crucial if you want to avoid the fat gain and muscle stagnation typical to new fathers.""Improving my kitchen skills rescued my health and restored my energy levels, but it also saved me a huge amount of time and money.""Challenge 3 FocusStaying focused is a constant battle for some peopleeven before they introduce a family into the mix. For others, it's fairly easy because they're driven. But if you're a new father, you're going to have a lot of obstacles to staying focused on your personal physique goals. Things are chaotic at home even in the best of times, there's a lot more to do to keep everything functioning for your family, and you will be totally fascinated by this incredible new baby.I navigated these unpredictable circumstances by scripting my day. I have a set schedule that I follow every single day, where I perform the most important tasks first, before something else has a chance to get in the way.""I can't stress enough how essential it is to focus on the most important things first.""I can't stress enough how essential it is to focus on the most important things first. I need to work out, eat welland make sure my wife does tooand run my business, so those tasks are scheduled first. I get up at 7 a.m. or earlier, eat, and then work out from 8-9 a.m. From 9-10, I cook. From 10-4, I work. Then, 4-8 p.m. is for spending time with my wife and daughter and having a good dinner. Our daughter goes to bed at 8 p.m., which gives me an hour and a half to spend relaxing with my wife and doing something fun. I do my best not to go back to the computer in the evening unless there is an emergency that can't wait.Even if you normally hate having a set schedule, I can't recommend it enough. We have a limited amount of willpower, especially when we're tired and busier than usual. A lot of guys balk at following a schedule because they don't like being told what to do, but don't forget that you're the one creating the schedule, and it's our goals that the schedule was created to meet.Challenge 4 AccountabilityNeeding some extra accountability is nothing to be embarrassed about. Some people find they do better with accountability at all times, while other people just need it during particularly challenging times like after a birth. That accountability might be something as small as having a buddy at the gym to check your progress or run sprints with you, or it could be something you pay for. It only has to make sense to one person: You.I chose to hire renowned coach Ryan Faehnle to write my workouts and meal plans, eliminating all guess work and giving me a structured and progressive program to follow. I've never believed in being your own coach, because any time I've coached myself, I get sub-optimal results. Not only do I get to benefit from Ryan's incredible knowledge and unique techniques, but I get to hand over the reins to someone else so I can focus on my other responsibilities.""Not only do I get to benefit from Ryan's incredible knowledge and unique techniques, but I get to hand over the reins to someone else so I can focus on my other responsibilities.""I realize that not everyone can afford to hire a great coach, and I'm not saying you can't get results on your own. But I will say that you'll always get faster results if can find someone to help you stay accountable to your workouts and meals. Join a community, either locally or virtually. Partner up with a friend who's interested in working together. Enter a transformation contest with a deadline. Follow a program designed by someone you look up to, and don't be afraid to spend a few bucks on a program so that you put some money at stake.Challenge 5 TimeTimeyou used to have a lot of it. Now you don't. Even if your schedule seemed jammed before you had a newborn, now it's completely covered up. Aside from focusing on what's important and creating a schedule that reflects that, the best thing you can do for you and your family is to get some help.No matter how amazing your wife is, she's not Superwoman. Don't expect her to be able to take care of the baby and everything having to do with your home life as well. Your wife may be working outside the home as well, just as you are. Do whatever you can to help each other, but don't be afraid to accept help when it's there for the taking.""Aside from focusing on what's important and creating a schedule that reflects that, the best thing you can do for you and your family is to get some help.""Even if you can't afford to pay for a cleaning service or help with the yard or whatever else, maybe you can find ways to barter for it. If you're an accountant, maybe you know a guy who can maintain your yard in exchange for help with his taxes. Maybe your wife's a hairstylist and knows someone who would gladly clean one morning each week in exchange for free haircuts or color. You get the idea. Let the in-laws and your parents or friends help out when they offer. It's temporary, they'll love being able to spend time with your baby, and you'll preserve your health, sanity, and marriage along the way.I'll leave you with one last tip that has become my mantra every time the baby pushes us to our limits: ""This too shall pass, soon to be replaced by something else."" It's one of my favorite quotes and it's so appropriate to the first few months of raising a newborn. Take steps to make sure that you stay on track so you don't have to start from square one over and over again. Along the way, remember to cherish every single moment with your newborn.

Jordan Edwards' Secrets For Instagram-Worthy Abs
Cellucor athlete and fitness model Jordan Edwards shares the secrets of her insane ab development. Burn, baby, burn!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jordan-edwards-secrets-for-instagram-worthy-abs.html,"Main Page | Ab Training Tips PDF | Offseason Abs | 5 Core Moves  Instagram-Worthy Abs | Redefine Your AbsVital StatsName: Jordan Edwards Occupation: Cellucor Ambassador and Fitness Model Website: jordankefit.comIt's not just Instagram #nofilter hype; Cellucor athlete and fitness model Jordan Edwards knows exactly what it takes to develop and maintain a photo-worthy set of abs. A former collegiate high jumper, she now spends her time helping others clear their own obstacles in their routines via her online training business. On a daily basis, she fields a number of questions from clients, the most frequent of which is, of course, ""How do I get abs like yours?""While the answer is layered, and of course includes plenty of discussion of diet, Edwards urges her clients to first explore one particular variable in their training setup: frequency.""I truly believe consistency is key with abs,"" she says. ""Most people train them once a week and get tired of it. However, in order to maintain a perfect six-pack, your abs should be trained at least three times a week, or every other weekday.""This doesn't mean falling into the trap of doing the same workout day after day. Edwards mixes it up with each workout, and the results speak for themselves. Here's how she achieves a new level of definition!Weight or No Weight? One of the most hotly debated topics pertaining to abdominal training is whether or not to use resistance. Some athletes swear by the judicious use of cables, medicine balls, and even machines to bring about the fine details in their abs. Edwards has used weights in the past, but today, she isn't so sure.""I don't typically like using resistance or weights for doing ab workouts, because I believe it makes my midsection look thicker and more muscular,"" she says. ""I like to do ab exercises on the floor, using strictly body weight, in order to really shred my midsection. Occasionally, I'll use a light load, as when doing hanging knee raises for obliques, but I avoid the heavier resistance, because my abs tend to take on a 'bigger' look."" Take it from the abdominal diva herself! If you're looking to bring out the muscular pop in your abs, spending some time working in moderate rep ranges with weighted movements can help. But when the goal changes to slimming your waistline and maintaining it, leave the heaviness for someone else. ""Women who just want that super flat, toned stomach may benefit more from doing movements with just their body weight.""Jordan Edwards' Abdominal Schedule""I like to split my ab workouts up in sections,"" she says. ""For instance, I'll emphasize the lower-ab region on Mondays with moves like hanging leg raises. Then, I'll hit oblique exercises on Wednesdays with exercises on the floor. Upper abs are on Fridays, and feature my favorite move, the decline-bench sit-up."" Dividing the work in this way allows Edwards to add volume to each area she's targeting. ""I usually do roughly 260 reps for abs in most workouts,"" she says. ""I train them until I simply can't take it anymore. This usually takes about 20 minutes.""Edwards' advanced workout consists of just one move, but follows a protocol of descending and ascending reps, which she says is killer. A good example is the hanging knee raise for lower abs. (Choose a challenging exercise but one that's not overly difficult.) She does 29 sets of the movement in this progression: set 1 is for 15 reps, then rest up to 30 seconds, then do a set for 14, alternating work:rest all the way down to 1 rep, then go back up to 15. In the video Edwards is shown doing the cable version for obliques and lower abs, which increases the level of difficulty.    Jordan Edwards' One-Move Ab Blitz  1  Hanging Leg Raise29 sets  Note: Start with 15 reps, rest 30 seconds, then 14, then 13, on down to 1 rep, then back up to 15. Advanced trainees can use cable-resisted knee raises for obliques or lower abs.               Alternate High-Rep PlanThe single-exercise approach isn't the only one Edwards favors in her ab training. Another rotates five exercises in a circuit (with very short rest periods) that's highly intense in which she completes almost 400 reps. A full 400 reps? How does she even count them? It's simple: Pick a few highly effective exercises, and use a rep scheme that allows you to rack up serious volume without doing serious math. ""My favorite technique that always gets my ab burning is a descending style of training,"" she says. ""I like to pick five different exercises and do them back to back for 30 reps. Then, I go back through all five exercises again for 25 reps, and then I end with 20 reps of all five back to back. The burn is intense!""     Jordan Edwards' Favorite Ab Workout  1  Toe Toucher1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec.   2  Decline Crunch1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec. Reach up toward the ceiling. If this movement is too difficult, break it into blocks of 10.   3 Hanging Leg Raise1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec. Do knee raises or sets of 10 if this is too difficult, or do the reverse crunch on the floor.  4  Dead Bug1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec.  5  Russian Twist1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec. Note: Do all exercises in order in circuit fashion, resting if necessary. Beginners can start with just 10 reps per move. More advanced trainees should do 30 reps of each movement, 25 on the second round, and 20 in the third.              ""I have been doing these same exercises for about eight years now, and my core is still going strong,"" Edwards says. ""I don't think doing new, tricky ab routines is the right way to go. I think the best way to shred your core is to go old school, grab a yoga mat, and do as many bodyweight reps as your core can take."" Here are her technique tips for these key moves: Toe toucher: ""The higher you reach the more you'll pull your shoulder blades off the floor. The lower abs get worked isometrically, so this is really a challenging movement, and the burn is intense.""Decline crunch: ""Don't put your hands behind your head; instead reach for the ceiling. Because it's so hard, you may have to break your reps into blocks of 10.""Hanging leg raise: ""Straightened legs are more difficult than the bent-knee version. Be sure tilt your pelvis toward your rib cage to target the lower region of your abs. That's an area most people find they need to work on.""Dead bug: ""I love dead bugs! Dead bugs give you the best burn, especially if you really focus on contracting the abs hard on each rep.""Russian twist: ""Don't do these with your feet anchored like shown in the photos. Raising your feet off the ground is more challenging; you'll have to maintain balance on your glutes.

Is Chocolate A Fit Or Fat Food?
We all know a diet of Butterfinger and Baby Ruth bars will make you pack on pounds, but is there a way to make chocolate work for you rather than against you? Science has the surprising answer.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/is-chocolate-a-fit-or-fat-food.html,"Halloween pumpkins, Santa Claus, Valentine's Day hearts, and the Easter Bunny: These festive symbols all have a common thread, or more accurately a common tastechocolate! I can't think of any other food that is associated with as many special events and celebrations as chocolate. It comes in every shape, is served world-round, and also targets some of the most fundamental human cravings. Fat? Check. Sugary carbs? Check. Energy? Bonus!As children, the rule of thumb when it came to chocolate was elation before hesitation. As adults the inverse is more often the case. That's because chocolate's hefty levels of calories, sugar, and fat have secured its position toward the top of the ""foods to avoid"" and ""special occasions only"" lists. This notion has been reinforced by countless dietary schemes that are more or less built around the old saying, ""If it tastes good, it must be bad for you. And if it tastes amazing, it must be even worse.""In recent years some amazing research has revealed that chocolateor at least its base ingredient, cacaomight work for you, not against, when it comes to achieving a fitter, healthier body.However, in recent years some amazing research has revealed that chocolateor at least its base ingredient, cacaomight work for you, not against, when it comes to achieving a fitter, healthier body. The powerful nutrients in this simple bean can help limit fat storage in the body, in addition to providing mood, circulatory, and cell protection benefits. And those are only the benefits we know about.The time has come for us to reclaim chocolate! Let's rethink its reputed sinfulness and explore the ways you can enjoy it without guilt.The Food of the GodsLong before jolly old Saint Nick and his reindeer, the Mayans and the Aztecs1 ruled the Americas. The reverence these civilizations had for chocolate went to a level that may seem extreme even to today's ardent chocoholics.The Aztecs used what they called ""the food of the gods"" as currency, and it was also the basis of what their leader Montezuma called ""the divine drink."" Only the upper crust was allowed to sample this heady concoction, which included roasted cacao beans, vanilla, and chili peppers.Despite the drink's bitter taste and cold, sludgy consistency, it was powerful stuff. The Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes noted that ""a cup of this precious drink permits a man to walk for a whole day without food.""2The Aztecs called it xocolatl, but since it could be the first sports drink, I like to call it ""Montezumade."" No matter what we call it, its spirit lives on in cacao's scientific name, Theobroma cacao, from the Greek words theo (god) and broma (drink).Cacao was brought back across the Atlantic in the 16th century, where it was sweetened and refined to match European tastes. The intercontinental fascinationand the refining and sweeteningcontinued escalating throughout the centuries into today's multibillion-dollar chocolate industry.Xocolatl, the ""Divine Drink"" of the Aztecs        Ingredientswater 2 3/4 cups of watergreen chili pepper 1 slicedcocoa powder 1/8  cupvanilla extract 1 tsp        DirectionsBoil chili in 3/4 cup water for 5-10 minutes. Strain out chilis, add in other 2 cups water, bring back to boil, whisking in vanilla as water heats up. Add in cocoa powder and continue whisking for 5 minutes. Let cool and serve. Just don't expect it to be sweet or particularly tasty!More Bliss, More Blood FlowMost people laugh when I tell them that chocolate is a fruit that grows on trees, but it's true! The cacao tree grows in tropical regions in Central and South Americas such as the Amazon and Orinoco river basins.The cacao fruit's pods contain seeds or ""beans"" that are rich in nutrients and fat. The seeds, when removed, can be ground into cocoa paste. It becomes cocoa powder once varying levels of the fatty cocoa butter are removed.Cocoa powder on its own is pretty acrid stuff, as are the raw cacao nibs that have begun showing up in health food stores in recent years. But it's still packed with remarkable nutrientsincluding a few you can feel working.One is theobromine, a type of kinder, gentler caffeine responsible for mild mental stimulatory properties, and which is also present to a lesser extent in some teas and in yerba mate.On the other side, cacao also contains the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is a precursor to the calming neurotransmitter serotonin; and anandamide, which is also known as the ""bliss molecule"" for its ability to promote relaxation.The counterbalancing outcome of these of nutrients is a relaxed energy sometimes referred to as the cacao ""buzz."" Researchers have been able to show a clear mood improvement in research studies wherein participants consumed a chocolate product.3-5However, many of those same study participants expressed feelings of guilt due the association between chocolate and unhealthiness. This buzz kill is unfortunate because cacao starts doing a lot of good once it's in your body.A Cardiovascular and Cellular Champion!A lot of the positive press about chocolate in recent years has revolved around a class of nutrients called flavonoids, which it contains in spades. These fascinating plant products are renowned for the positive effects they can have on circulation and cardiovascular health.In a few prominent studies over the last decade, flavonoids from cacao have been shown to support the mechanics of optimal blood flow as well as desirable blood pressure and cholesterol levels.2,6-9 One study showed that just two weeks of including dark chocolate in the diet increased the potential for additional blood flow that could be accessed when necessary.9 And as anyone who has heard of ""blood doping"" knows, having more blood to deliver to muscle during and after exercise can translate to optimized performance and recovery.How does this work? Well, for one, cacao is rich in arginine, the amino acid that is the immediate precursor to nitric oxide. And nitric oxide, you may have heard, is a key regulator of blood flow that works by increasing the diameter of blood vessels supplying body tissueincluding muscle.8 Chocolate also seems to have a say in how much nitric oxide is made and how long it lasts in tissue. And, let's not forget that regular dark chocolate consumption also has been clearly linked to lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels, despite the saturated fat it contains.15-16Cacao is also packed with antioxidants, including but not limited to the famous flavonoids. Antioxidants are critical for hard-training people who burn more calories, and thus produce more free radicals in their bodies.Researchers at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom saw this in action in 2011 when they analyzed cyclists who consumed dark chocolate regularly for two weeks prior to a strenuous ride.10 While the dark chocolate didn't appear to increase performance, it did reduce markers of inflammation during recovery. Other researchers have noted that a couple weeks of dark chocolate consumption likewise improved markers of inflammation in non-athletic women.11Unfortunately, it's not clear at present to what extent we can expand these conclusions to muscle damage and recovery after resistance training. This is certainly an important area waiting for exploration. But the overall health benefits from cacao are increasingly clear.Chocolate for a Leaner, Healthier Body?As the dots pile up in the ""pro-choco"" column, you may be tempted to think purely in terms of math: ""Do the overall benefits of eating chocolate outweigh the caloric cost?"" Unfortunately, there's no simple way to answer that question, because those fantastic flavonoids do more than help your heart. They might also help to keep you lean!12One study, for instance, concluded that cacao components can reduce the efficiency of carbohydrate- and fat-digesting enzymes, which could benefit body weight management.13 Other research suggests that cacao nutrients might also work at the genetic level, reducing the activity of genes that produce proteins which increase fat storage.14Interestingly, in the cycling study mentioned above, the researchers also noted that the levels of fatty acids in the blood increased during cycling, which suggests greater release from fat tissue.10 This is promising, but cocoa and fat-loss connections are another area that could use further research and will no doubt get it.Get Your Square A Day!In case you haven't figured it out already, I firmly believe that chocolate and fitness can coexist  with a caveat: The health benefits from chocolate come from the cacao part, not from the additives that the Willy Wonkas of the world use to make it sweeter, creamier, and subsequently lighter product known as cocoa. So think in terms of ""cacao,"" not ""chocolate.""In general, choose products greater than 70 percent cacao, which is dark but still sweet enough to be appetizing for most people.When choosing chocolate, read labels. Look for darker, lower-fat, and lower-sugar varieties, and in particular, the products that clearly call out the percentage of cacao. In general, choose products greater than 70 percent cacao, which is dark but still sweet enough to be appetizing for most people. Shoot for 1.5-2.0 oz. of dark chocolate, which will deliver the level of flavonoids determined in several studies to support cardiovascular benefits.Most people find they can't eat dark chocolate in the same quantities as milk chocolate, but it's nevertheless important to keep in mind that even at that high of level of cacao, you will still get calories from fats and carbohydrates. The amount is roughly 200 calories per 1.5 oz., depending on the manufacturer.However, much of this will occur naturally, coming from the cacao itself. A milk chocolate product containing about the same calorie level may have double the sugar (24g versus 12g) of dark chocolate, and only one quarter of the fiber content.So be selective and be restrained. But don't beware, because chocolate is good for you.Dymatize NutritionOffering a variety of sports nutrition supplements designed to meet and exceed your fitness goals.Go Now!ReferencesHurst WJ, Tarka SM Jr, Powis TG, Valdez F Jr, Hester TR.

Armed Anarchy: Extreme Muscle-Building Arm Workout
Wage war against your tiny biceps and baby triceps. These 8 arm-training tips and extreme muscle-building workout are just what you need for extreme growth!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/armed-anarchy-extreme-muscle-building-arm-workout.html,"There's no better feeling than a pump in your biceps and triceps. It's true: 9 out of 10 broscientists agree that the pump is an addictive, ultra-necessary part of any arm workout. The pump has also been gym-clinically proven to boost confidence, support muscle growth, and keep you coming back for more gains-inducing punishment. If your workout hasn't been providing you the pump your arms need, or the size and shape you've been expecting, it's probably time to reassess your biceps and triceps workout and how you perform it. MuscleTech athlete and bodybuilding competitor Jesse Hobbs wants to help you do it. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out or have been in the gym for a couple of yearsfollow his eight bits of biceps-building and triceps-training advice, implement his workout, and you'll have the powerful, defined arms you've always wanted. 1 Arm your split ""One of the best ways to put on size is to hit your arms with more volume. I have a chest and triceps day, a back and biceps day, and then three days later, I hit the gym for a biceps and triceps workout,"" says Hobbs.This split works well, because when you hit your biceps and triceps with dedicated work, they'll be prefatigued from your back and chest work earlier in the week. When you get a chance to crush them, you can bring them to the state of full fatigue needed for massive growth. ""Increasing the blood flow to the muscles several times per week has really helped increase the size of my arms,"" explains HobbsHaving a workout that focuses exclusively on your arms after a few days of rest will help you feel fresh when you lift. Having lots of energy will allow you to lift maximal weight, which can increase the size and strength of your arms. A workout setup like this can really help you crack the next level of arm growth, so consider training your arms with a dedicated day and on days when you target larger body parts. 2 Recover for growth Even though more volume can lead to increased growth, don't get caught training your arms every day. Rest and recovery are essential for continued gains. You break down muscle in the gym, but you build it at rest with proper nutrition.""Getting sufficient rest for your arms is key,"" adds Hobbs. ""You utilize your arms in almost every lift in the gym, so it's important to give them a break between big body parts and dedicated sessions.""3 Supp wisely Hobbs also credits the supplements he uses for his success in the gym. ""I've seen great results from using Anarchy for my pre-workout supplement, Amino Build for my post-workout supplement, and NITRO-TECH for extra protein,"" he says.  Hobbs also credits the supplements he uses for his success in the gym. Pre-workouts are designed to help boost your energy, increase your blood flow, and push you to peak performance during each and every workout. Post-workouts give you a shot of the nutrients you need to grow immediately after training, and protein is absolutely essential for tissue growth and repair. While these supplements will never do all the work for you, they can help boost your energy levels, support blood and nutrient flow to the muscles, and help the muscle recovery process. Having a little assistance from supplements could mean faster results. 4 Controlled chaos Muscle growth comes from proper form and control, not necessarily super-heavy weight. To build great-looking arms, doing the exercises correctly is much more important than using as much weight as you can. ""It's critical to never swing your body into a curl,"" says Hobbs. ""If that happens, it's a sure sign you're using too much weight.""The minute you start swinging the weight during a curl is the minute you take the tension off your biceps. Constant tension on your muscles is what's going to make them grow. If you use other body parts or momentum to move heavy weight, your biceps workout will become less effective and you may also set yourself up for injury.""Keep your shoulder locked into place as you do a curl,"" says Hobbs. ""This should help you focus on moving only your elbow.""MuscleTech AnarchyExplosive pre-workout concentrate designed to enhance muscle strength and power!Go Now!5 Mind your elbows Building on the point above, your elbows drive every biceps and triceps movement. Your biceps flex the elbow, and the triceps extend it. So, think about your elbow positioning for every biceps and triceps movement you perform. Notice how your elbow positioning can impact how the exercises feel and how much weight you can use. Poor elbow positioning can cause discomfort and even injury. Mind the cardinal rule of training: If it hurts, don't do it. If it doesn't hurt, look for the best way to do it. In this case, the best elbow positions are those that allow you to feel maximum tension on your working muscles. ""When performing concentration curls, I like to keep my elbows pointed inward,"" says Hobbs. ""Using a preacher bench can help you maintain good form [and] keep your biceps working the entire time.""'6 Maintain constant tension To get the most out of each exercise, try to keep your muscles under tension throughout the range of motion. For the majority of exercises, your muscle gets to rest at the very bottom and very top of the movement. Shorten the range of motion just a little to maintain constant tension. ""For example,"" says Hobbs, ""the lowest point in a dip should be 45 degrees. At this point, you'll get a nice chest and delt stretch while maintaining constant tension on the triceps. At the top, don't lock out so much that your delts take all the stress off the triceps. Keep a slight bend so your triceps start to feel the burn!""  To get the most out of each exercise, try to keep your muscles under tension throughout the range of motion. You can utilize this same concept when performing triceps pull-downs. ""At the top, your arms should be at a 45-degree angle with your elbows bent,"" says Hobbs. ""Don't bring your arms up any farther than this, or you'll lose tension.""You may notice that your muscles fatigue more quickly when you keep them under constant tension. When that happens, you may need to use less weight in order to maintain good form and control. 7 Hold the squeeze Increase your pump, time under tension, and work performed by holding the peak contraction of every rep for a beat before releasing. ""At the end of triceps pull-downs, I like to roll the bottom of the ropes outward to get that extra bit of squeeze,"" explains Hobbs. Hobbs also recommends ""negative holds,"" in which you have a partner help you move a heavier-than-normal weight, then squeeze your working muscle at the peak contraction. ""Negative holds can also be a great way get deep into the muscle tissue,"" Hobbs says. He also suggests turning your pinky out and squeezing your biceps as you reach the end of a biceps curl. Doing so will help refine your biceps peak so you can get that baseball look.8 Finish strong If you're doing a long, tough workout, it's easy to lose focus by the end. To ensure that your mind and your body are working hard throughout your time in the gym, you may want to implement a tough workout finisher. ""I like to end my arms workout with a devastating triset finisher,"" says Hobbs. ""It's great for shoving even more blood into your triceps to help induce the greatest possible growth.""A finisher also gives you something to look forward to when you begin to lose focus.

Postnatal Ab Training: Fit Mommy Core Circuit
Every new mom wants to get her pre-baby body back. But a lot of women make the mistake of training improperly. Here's the info and workout you need!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/post-natal-ab-training-fit-mommy-core-circuit.html,"The most common question we get asked as postnatal trainers is: ""How do I get my tummy back to normal after giving birth?"" If you want your pre-baby body back or even better than it was, we can help.During pregnancy, women become athletes, if they weren't already. We have up to 50 percent more blood, which increases oxygen uptake so we can create another human being inside us! This alone is incredible. Combine that with what the female body goes through during labor, and we become full-blown superheroes. New moms are extraordinarily strong and well-positioned to regain their shape after giving birth.After nine months of extreme change around the midsection, the most important thing you can do post-partum is to start strengthening the core muscles. The best way to do it is to use a corrective exercise program that enables the body to heal from the inside out, building stability, strength, and muscle endurance. The internal abdominals need time and care to return to their pre-pregnancy condition, so hitting 100 crunches a day in a bid for a flat tummy can potentially cause more damage.Instead, start with the basics.Tummy Check  /// Your first step should be to check for abdominal separation. Why? This could potentially stop you from healing properly and enabling your abdominals to regain their former strength and shape.Some women have what they call the ""pooch"" under the belly button. In many cases, this is caused by the abdominal separation that wasn't addressed before they began a postnatal exercise regime.Here's how to do it:Rec CheckWatch The Video - 01:33   Lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet on the floor.Place one hand behind your head and the other hand on your abdomen, with your fingertips across your midlineparallel with your waistlineat the level of your belly button.With your abdominal wall relaxed, gently press your fingertips into your abdomen.Roll your upper body off the floor into a ""crunch,"" making sure that your ribcage moves closer to your pelvis.Move your fingertips back and forth across your midline, feeling for the right and left sides of your rectus abdominis muscle. Test for separation at, above, and below your belly button, measuring by fingers width.If you have more than a three-finger separation between your abs, seek advice from your health care professional before beginning a program.Post-Preggo Conditioning Circuit  /// Below is a six-exercise core conditioning circuit designed to help you heal from the inside out, reduce your separation, and achieve the ultimate flat tummy. In advance of starting the program, please receive consent from your health care professional to return to exercise.To do this circuit, you'll work for 40 seconds and rest for 20 for all six exercises. Complete the entire circuit two times through. Try to do it 3-4 times per week.1 / Mini CrunchThis is not a crunch. To do it properly, lie down on your back, then try to lift your head and shoulder blades off the ground. Keep your head tucked. Your hands should be sliding along the ground to your feet or behind your head. This is a very small movement; you should be aiming to produce a large contraction in your abdominals. Hold for 5-10 seconds before lowering back down in a controlled manner, then repeat.2 / Beginner PlankBegin lying face down on the floor. Prop yourself up on your knees and elbows. Position your elbows so they're directly underneath the shoulder and maintain a straight posture from the heel through to the shoulders. Hold for the duration of the interval and concentrate on engaging the transverse abdominus.3 / Heel SlidesThere are three parts to this exercise. First, lie on your back with your knees bent. Slowly let your right knee move to the right, keeping your low back and pelvis level. Return to the center and repeat with the left.Then, slide the right foot along the floor, straightening the knee. Slide the foot back toward the hip, and repeat with the left. Be sure that the floor supports the weight of the leg and that the foot does not lift off of the floor.Finally, lift the right foot off the floor, keeping the knee bent. Don't hold your breath and don't bulge your lower abdomen. Return the foot to the floor and repeat with the left foot. Focus on your breathing: Inhale when you lift and exhale to rest or hold.4 / Seated Knee Abduction with BandSit on an exercise ball or a chair and bring your knees together. Tie a resistance band around your knees. Press the legs outward against the band as you perform the hold and activate the pelvic floor muscles. Set a comfortable rhythm for the duration of the interval.5 / Kneeling Scapula Retraction with BandGet on your knees and hold the resistance band out in front of you. Put tension on the band by making sure your hands are slightly wider than shoulder-width. Slightly bend your elbows. Pinch your shoulder blades together until your forearms are perpendicular to your body. Release and then repeat. For this movement, make sure you activate your abdominals and your pelvic floor.6 / SquatStand with feet shoulder-width apart. Initiate the movement by pushing your hips back and down until they reach knee level. Keep your weight in your heels and your lower back flat. To return to the start, push through the heels and stand up. Exhale as you come back up. While doing this movement, keep your abs engaged.// <![CDATA[quickstart_training_white(""Fit Mommy Core Circuit"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=Circuit:+2+rounds&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Mini+Crunch:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Beginner+Plank:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Heel+Slides:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Seated+Knee+Abduction+with+Band:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Kneeling+Scapula+Retraction+with+Band:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Squat:+40+seconds,+rest+20+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&TotalExercises=7&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=&name=Fit+Mommy+Core+Circuit"");// ]]>Printable PagePDF Document For more information and free post-natal fitness gifts visit Fitmummymanual.com!// <![CDATA[var addthis_config = {data_use_flash: false}// ]]>"

Physical and Health Education, University of Toronto  Occupation: Founder of CircuitFIT, Co-founder of PharmaFreak and SD Pharmaceuticals  Website(s): pharmafreak.com;  circuitfit.com; sdpharmaceuticals.comWide, ripped, thick, and freaky-strong is how most fit fanatics would describe their dream back. A super V-taper that makes your waist look tiny is priceless, but it's no easy feat! The back is a large body part, so it requires a lot of energy, intensity, and proper planning to build a routine that generates great results. Luckily, I'm a master planner.So many different movements can build your back. Barbell rows, cable rows, deadlifts, and chin-ups come to mind, and that's just scratching the surface. Where do you start, and what do you prioritize? This article will detail five top-notch back exercises you don't want to miss. Mix them into your routine to switch things up and keep your muscles guessing!5 Must-Do Back Moves! Watch The Video - 04:28 Look BackBefore you hit the gym and attack your back, you need to know the muscles you are targeting. Let's check out the functions of the major muscle groups of the back: the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, erector spinae, teres major, and rhomboids.Muscle and FunctionMuscle: Latissimus Dorsi, a.k.a. ""lats""  Function: Pull the arm down toward pelvis; pull body up toward armMuscle: Trapezius, a.k.a. ""traps""  Function: Scapular elevation, adduction, and depressionMuscle: Erector Spinae  Function: Extend and support spineMuscle: Teres Major  Function: Move humerus posteriorlyMuscle: Rhomboids  Function: Bring scapula toward spinal columnCool FactBACK FACT: The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches along the spine  from the ribcage all the way down to the hipbones. In other words,  it runs all the way down your back! It connects to the humerus bone along the underside of the upper arm.Must-Do Movements1 Chin-Up 21sTransform your basic chins into super chins that force your back to grow! The 21s technique will increase your muscles' time under tension while targeting three different ranges of motion.This creates a fuller and wider V-taper by developing the lats as well as the overall back musculature. Use a pronated (overhand) grip to target more lats and less biceps.Bottom Position - Middle Position - Top PositionExecutionTake hold of a chin-up bar with a wide, overhand grip.Start from the bottom position with a full stretch in your back.Perform 7 reps from the bottom to the midpoint of the exercise.Perform 7 reps from the midpoint to the top of the exercise.Perform the last 7 reps with a full range of motion. Pull your body up to the top by pulling your shoulder blades together and down. Slowly resist your bodyweight as you descend to the starting position.TipPull your shoulder blades together and down as you lift yourself up. Use a spotter or the chin-assist machine if necessary.2 Barbell Rack RowsWe're going to start these rows from a dead stop off the rack, which breaks the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise and forces you to recruit more muscle fibers for greater power, development, and growth. This technique will also boost your back thickness.Barbell Rack RowsExecutionLoad the bar at mid-shin height on a rack and take a shoulder-width grip.Pull the bar up toward your ribcage in a dynamic and explosive manner. Resist the weight back onto the rack.Pause on the rack for a second or two to release back tension, then repeat for reps.VariationFor an added challenge, add chains to each side of the bar to alter the strength curve and add progressive resistance through the pulling phase.3 Blackburn Back ExtensionThis exercise increases the strength and stability of your back musculature while targeting the entire posterior chain. It improves posterior chain muscle balance and strength, which translates to injury prevention and stronger compound lifts like squats, rows, presses, and deadlifts.Blackburn Back ExtensionExecutionGet set on an isometric back extension. Hold your upper body in line with your legs.Start with your arms overhead and your thumbs pointed up. Switch your arms out to the sides with your thumbs up. Your arms should now be perpendicular to your body.Bend your elbows at a 90-degree angle and externally rotate your shoulders.Finish by moving your arms to your sides and turn your palms up to the ceiling. Hold each position for 3-5 seconds and focus on retracting your shoulder blades.VariationAdd weights to increase the demand on the stabilizers and the entire posterior chain.4 Alternating Kettlebell RowsTargeting one side of your back at a time improves balance and development. The dynamic aspect of alternating rows also requires more energy and develops overall back and pulling power.This move shocks the back and offers a different challenge than traditional dumbbells. It improves functional power and grip strength, which is especially useful for sport-specific conditioning.Alternating Kettlebell RowsExecutionGrab a pair of heavy kettlebells and, with your knees slightly bent, hinge from the hips.Brace your core and keep your back flat.Pull one kettlebell up to your armpit and twist through your obliques as you bring your elbow up and past your torso.Row to the opposite side and keep the exercise moving with a dynamic and continuous tempo.VariationTurn this into a more isolated exercise by doing these face down on an incline bench.5 Straight-Arm Pull-downThis exercise isolates the lats with a controlled movement. We're going to use a rope attachment to create an even greater range of motion.Straight-arm pull-downs let you target the lats without the interference of secondary muscles. This is a great finishing exercise to build the mind-muscle connection.ExecutionTake hold of a rope attachment and step a few feet away from a cable machine.With your feet shoulder-width apart and your chest open, pull from the shoulder joint with straight arms by contracting your lats.Bring the rope as far down as possible outside of your hips.Squeeze and slowly return the rope to eye level.VariationFor an added challenge, grab both ends of the rope with one hand and isolate each side with a one-arm pull-down."

Holly Powell Interview!
As a trainer and nutritionist, one of the dilemmas I face is convincing other mothers that they can get themselves into incredible shape regardless. This month I introduce to you, Holly Powell - mother, athlete and inspiration!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kristin2.htm,"Holly Powell is an inspiration. I recently had the privilege to meet Holly and become good friends at the most recent NPC Figure National event in New York City. What I found to be most incredible about this beautiful athlete from Columbus, Ohio is that she is a mother and did not begin her competitive career until after giving birth to her son.  As a trainer and nutritionist, one of the dilemmas I face is convincing other mothers that they can get themselves into incredible shape regardless. This month I introduce to you, Holly Powell - mother, athlete and inspiration!  The Interview   Kristin Reisinger: Please tell me a little bit about your background: age, athletic background, childhood, etc. Anything you might feel is pertinent to where you are now in terms of fitness and competition.  Holly Powell: I am 31 years old and have always been an active person ever since childhood. I never really competed in any sports because my family moved around all the time. I never went to the same school for more than 2 years until high school. When I say I always kept active, I mean, I never liked just sitting around. I was always outside playing, riding my bike, roller skating keeping busy. I'm that way as an adult too. However, I did attempt track (the 400m) my freshman year of high school. I wasn't very good so that was the only year I tried. I didn't push myself and really had no support from family so I gave up.  KR: How long have you been involved in fitness and how did you get involved?  HP: I have been involved in fitness for 10 years. Right before my 21st birthday I looked in the mirror and saw things, that well, looked like what I saw on my mother. Saddlebags, love handles, etc., so I joined a small gym called ""Performance fitness"" that was just down the road. I began taking aerobic classes and fell in love.  Three months later my husband and I both joined Bally's and I began weight training and have been hooked ever since. I remember I would never train my chest because I was afraid I would look too much like a guy, so I trained every other body part, until my husband convinced me otherwise! In 1995 my husband and I moved to Florida where he became the Fitness Director at Gold's Gym and trained many, many clients. I loved going into the gym at 11:00pm and having the entire place to myself to train -- it was awesome! Those were the days which are all different, now that I'm a mother.  KR: What kind of shape were you in before you became pregnant?  HP: I was in above average shape before I got pregnant. My body fat was around 19-20% and I trained 5 days a week, but not at the intensity I do now. I was kind of in a ""maintenance"" mode. I wasn't making huge gains, but also wasn't gaining body fat. I was size 5/6 and happy with my body.  KR: What was your pregnancy like in terms of weight gain and activity level?  HP: When I found out I was pregnant I didn't stop working out. I still trained 5 days a week, but at a lower intensity level. I still did squats, lunges, barbell curls, etc. I was really concerned about keeping my weight under control. Sometime in November, I was about 6 months along in my pregnancy, my doctor told me I was beginning to dilate and should back off on the workouts.  I guess a lot of pressure gets put on the baby from standing for periods of time while weight training as well as jumping around doing cardio. I've heard stories of women being on bedrest for long periods of time and I didn't want that to be me. At this point in my life I had been working out consistently for 7 years and felt anxious for a break. I wanted to enjoy my pregnancy and nothing else.  So let's just say I felt I was given a get out of jail free card, which isn't an excuse for how I ate, but I fulfilled all my cravings. I was 138lbs. before I got pregnant, and was about 183lbs when I gave birth. You do the math... +45lbs!!  KR: How did you feel about your body after you gave birth?  HP: I hated my body after I gave birth. Like I said I had been in above average shape for the past 7 years and felt disgusted with how I looked. I hated feeling how loose and rolly-polly my stomach was. Yuck. I was really, really depressed. I avoided looking in the mirror all together. I began to breastfeed (which was awesome) and started burning calories from the get go. I remember every time after I finished nursing my baby I was starving! Once I got the okay from my doc I began working out again, about 6 weeks after giving birth.  KR: What was your training schedule and nutrition plan like after the pregnancy?  HP: In the beginning there was no plan. I was nursing my son what seemed like every 2-3 hours (hmmm, kinda how I eat now!) and was completely exhausted. I tried to get to the gym 3-4 days a week, easing my way back into it. I didn't have much energy or drive, it was harder than what I had expected. I remember a few times while I was at the gym my husband would call saying my son had woken up and was screaming to be nursed, so needless to say my workouts got cut short many times.  As far as nutrition goes, I started cleaning up my diet. I knew making wise food choices would be beneficial for my health, state of mind, and would be good for my son since I was nursing. So I began eating healthy again once he was born. Or course, I'd have treats and cheats, I just tried to limit it to the weekends.  KR: You didn't decide to compete until after you had a child. What sparked the interest in figure competition?  HP: My son was 10 months old when Davana Medina won the first ever Figure National title. I remember looking at her picture and thinking, ""I want to do that!"" She looked so awesome and her body type is very, very similar to mine. That's what sparked my interest. Then, I went to the Arnold Classic in 2003 and saw the first ever Pro Figure show and that pretty much sealed my fate.  I felt I had a good chance since I had been weight training for 9 years. I knew I had great muscle maturity. I also knew the hard part would be shedding the fat. I got down to a comfortable size 7/8 and some 9/10's for about 2 years after giving birth. I wasn't thrilled with my condition and knew competition dieting would get me where I wanted to be, back down to my pre-baby size of a 5/6.  KR: How long did you prepare for the 2003 Figure Nationals?  HP: I began dieting February 2nd, 2003 to prepare for a local NPC show, the Michael Francois classic held on May 28th, 2003. I placed 15th out of 26 girls. I wasn't unhappy with my placing. I wasn't as lean as I wanted to be and my posing was horrible! My body fat was 11.5% for that show.  It was a start, and I was hooked. I set my sights on Nationals and kept dieting straight through. I had 12 weeks before Nationals. I actually took about 6 weeks after the show in May and tried to take advantage of the anabolic phase I was about to enter. I trained heavy and increased my calories. I then started dieting hard the last 6 weeks. It was rough. My body didn't like being in such a calorie ""deficit"".  I remember so many times when I would stand up I would get dizzy and see stars. That's not good. I was probably starting to become a little catabolic, not to mention my body was being stubborn and did not want to let go of any more fat. I now know with every show I do, I will stay leaner more naturally. It just takes time. Not to mention I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for all the support and coaching from my wonderful husband, Craig. He has been there every step of the way.  KR: How did you feel about the results for your first national show?  HP: I was so HAPPY! I came in at about 9.5% body fat. I was the 5th call out in my one piece (20th-25th place) and the 6th call out for my two piece (25th-30th place) and that was out of 64 girls! I left feeling more invigorated and focused than I've ever felt in my life.  For the first time I actually feel I'm where I belong. I've longed to compete, but didn't want to compete as a female bodybuilder and knew I had no chance of doing fitness contest since I couldn't do a back flip if my life depended on it! It was one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had. I didn't need a trophy to feel I accomplished my goal. Being on that stage summed it all up for me.  KR: What are your fitness goals for the future?  HP: Right now I am working on my ""lagging"" body parts and training really heavy to put some more size on my upper body. I plan on competing at the Jr. USA's in April. When I tell people about the next show I'm doing they always say... ""you've got time, it's so far away..."" but I'm on a scheduled program and feel it's right around the corner! Sometimes I feel a little frantic because I want to start dieting 16 weeks out for the Jr. USA's which means right after Christmas it all beginsand we all know how the holidays sneak up on us!!  KR: If there were one thing you could tell a mother looking to get into shape post-pregnancy, what would it be?  HP: Set a goal. Have a date in mind that you'd like to reach your goal by and go for it! Having a goal helps you stay focused. Realize you are not just doing it for yourself, but for your child too. There's nothing to it but to do it. Of course you are busy, but plan each day with some sort of activity. Have forethought and prepare yourself for a life of good health and fitness... for the rest of your life. Kids are full of tons of energy and it takes good mental and physical health just to keep up with them!

Post-Pregnancy Plan: 8 New-Mom Fitness Rules
It's a few weeks after delivery, and you're itching to get back your pre-baby body. Here's your post-pregnancy fitness plan.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/post-pregnancy-plan-8-new-mom-fitness-rules.html,"Your body is amazing. For nine months you focused all of your energy on creating another human being, and you finally accomplished it. Congratulations! But even if you were active during your first trimester, you've likely gained some unwanted weight or lost pre-pregnancy definition. When it comes to regaining your figure, working out is essential. But knowing when to work out, what to expect, and how to steer clear of temptation is even more important. Luckily, I've been through it twice. Here are eight helpful the rules I picked up along the way! 1 / Follow Recovery Recommendations My midwife didn't give me clearance to work out until six weeks postpartum. That's a standard recommendation, which maybe even longer if you had a c-section. Follow it. Working out too soon can actually make your recovery period last longer; cause long-term damage to your stomach muscles; and, if you are breastfeeding, affect your milk supply. Instead of giving in to that itch to hit the treadmill or biceps curl to exhaustion, go on a family walk. Just 30 minutes each day of a fresh air stroll a day has been shown to increase your cardiorespiratory fitness, decrease body fat, and reduce depression.1  2 / Prep and Freeze Meals Pre-Baby If you're struggling to find the time to work out right after your baby's born, focus on your nutrition. After my first son was born, I was tired, sore, and emotionaland I had a fussy baby who wouldn't let me put him down for long. Cooking was out of the question. I resorted to the easy, unhealthy route: think lots of pizza delivery and cold cereal. If you aren't focusing on the food you're fueling your body with, you're probably going to have a tough time shedding the weight and toning up.The second time around, I decided to come prepared and freeze healthy meals that I could pop in the crock pot once the baby arrived. Chicken tortilla, beef and barley, and minestrone soup were all on the menu, along with honey lime and sweet and sour chicken. I also prepped double batches of Jamie Eason's protein bars, which were a lifesaver after the baby came.  3 / Say Yes to Protein Powder (One Serving) My doctor told me that one serving of protein powder per day was perfectly fine to use while nursing, as long as it wasn't my only source of protein for the day. Try to use protein powders that don't include artificial sweeteners or fillers. My favorite kind of protein is MRM All Natural Whey Rich Vanilla flavorit's what I used while I was pregnant and now that I am breastfeeding. If you have questions, always check with your doctor. 4 / Leave Junk Food at the Checkout Counter While it might seem like a no-brainer, giving up junk food can be a struggle, especially for a new mom. Exhaustion will likely weaken your willpower, and the meals people bring as gifts might not be the healthiest option. Still, you'll be grateful, and you'll eat them. Counter the platters of lasagna, chicken fingers, and baked mac and cheese by stocking up on fresh fruit and lean protein. Prepare easy-to-grab snacks like homemade protein bars and pre-packed sliced veggies.  5 / Breastfeed to Speed Up Weight Loss Bag the bottle. Not only will breastfeeding ensure you're passing on whole-food nutrients to your baby, it will also help you shed the baby weight.You can burn up to 500 calories per day just by breastfeeding! It also helps your uterus contract, which will help make your stomach flatten faster during those first two weeks. Breastfeeding can be difficult at first. I struggled nursing my daughter in the first two weeks. Try reading up on breastfeeding before the baby is bornIna May's Guide to Breastfeeding was the most helpful book I foundand prepare to work with a lactation consultant after the baby comes.  6 / Once Cleared to Work Out, Squeeze Them in When You Can Don't count on consistency. Once you get clearance to exercise, it's unlikely that you'll still have a full hour to dedicate to the Stairmaster. It might be hard to get into a regular schedule during the first couple of months when the baby's still not sleeping through the night, and most gym daycare facilities won't take babies until they're at least 6 months old. So squeeze in a trip to the gym whenever you can, and get creative with at-home workouts. I've gotten some serious results using Ashley Conrad's Celebrity Abs routine. Still strapped for time? Remember, even a short post-dinner family walk while pushing the stroller or strapping on the baby carrier is better than doing nothing at all.  7 / Celebrate Your Small Victories I really struggled with this one after I first got back in the gym. The extra weight left me feeling frustrated, and I was embarrassed that I couldn't lift heavy. I felt like I didn't belong in the weight room around all the fit people. I pushed through it by reminding myself that I'd felt this way after my first son was born, and that nothing was going to change until I started putting in the work. You can feel uncomfortable now or three months from now, but you're always going to have a starting point. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll stop feeling self-conscious. I try to remind myself that I feel better when I work out. It builds my confidence, makes me happier, and usually leads me to make smarter nutritional choices. Your workouts might not start out as intense as they were pre-pregnancy, but you'll eventually get back to that point and should be proud of your progress along the way.  8 / Remember, It's Not a Race Getting back in shape takes time, and simply removing the baby that was inside you isn't enough to get back your tight tummy. After I had my first son, I was surprised that I came home and still looked six months pregnant. I remember feeling so bad about the extra weight. While I eventually shed the pounds and regained my shape, it didn't happen overnight. It took months. If I had known that most women still look pregnant after they have a baby, my self-talk would have been a little more loving. Clean eating and exercise will get you back in shape, but give yourself a realistic time frame. Now I know not to expect to feel totally back to normal for 9-12 monthsthe time it takes for me to lose the weight, for my hips to go back down, and to rebuild the muscle I had pre-pregnancy. On my website and Facebook page I've been sharing my post-partum photos during this process to hopefully try to normalize the images we see of a woman's normal post-partum belly and hopefully make other people feel comfortable during the process as well.

An Interview With Celebrity Personal Trainer Ashley Borden.
With almost 20 years experience as a trainer, Ashley has learned many lessons. As a celebrity trainer she has had experiences most of us can only dream about. In the following interview she shares her knowledge and experiences.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson332.htm,"Ashley Borden: the name is synonymous with physical performance results, and advanced body transformation. Excellence: what Ashley strives for when aiming to take her clients' health and fitness goals to new heights and what her clients themselves have come to expect from Ashley. And results and excellence are probably responsible for the LA fitness guru and body transformation specialist's reputation and success as a celebrity personal trainer.  Traditionally a population with high aspirations and standards, the celebrity crowd are, as would be expected, an exceedingly challenging group to work with. As their careers either live or die based on how they look and perform, it is Ashley's job to ensure that each of her clients' enjoys longevity and prosperity as an entertainer, a role she never tires nor fails at.  In an industry where you are hot one day and not the next, each celebrity Ashley guides seeks her out specifically, to help keep them at the relevant end of the entertainment spectrum.  Click Image To Enlarge.Ashley Borden. But what separates Ashley from the thousands of personal trainers currently expanding into the celebrity market? For one thing she has 17 years experience training a wide range of people, from the housewife to the elite sporting-star.  Then there is her personal battle with eating disorders that have, understandably, given her a strong sense for helping others and the experience necessary for turning negatives into positives. And this goes to the very heart of body transformation.  By its very nature, a body transformation necessitates a strong will to overcome some kind of physical flaw, whether largely perceived as in the muscular bodybuilder who sees himself as being small, or startlingly real as in the overweight housewife in dire need of an effective fat loss program.  Regardless of how extreme, any body transformation requires professional intervention from one who has both the experience and the desire to really help, to make a difference and to facilitate positive change. This is what separates Ashley from the pack and makes her the best in her field.  With almost 20 years experience as a trainer, Ashley has learned many lessons. As a celebrity trainer she has had experiences most of us mere mortals can only dream about. In the following Bodybuilding.com interview she shares her knowledge and her experiences.  Interview  [ Q ] How long have you been a personal trainer Ashley?     I've been a  personal trainer for 17 years.  [ Q ] Was celebrity personal training a gradual progression for you or was this something you started out doing?     No, since I started my training business it (the celebrity training) has just been an ongoing progression. A lot of celebrity training has to do with living in the town where the action is happening so it just happened through referrals. I was just working at the gym and they had someone come in. It was a referral and then it was all basically word of mouth from there, especially in the entertainment industry.  [ Q ] Who was your first celebrity client?     My first celebrity client was Sean Hayes who was on Will and Grace. We worked on building muscle. I put about 17 pounds of muscle on his frame and we trained the whole off-season (when not filming) and he got so muscular and looked so good the producers were horrified that he was so big. And they were, ""You know what, he is too muscular."" I was, ""You don't have to hate on it; you can make him look skinny and scrawny."" But he was great; he and I worked very well together. He is one of my dearest friends here.  Click Image To Enlarge.Sean Hayes And Ashley Borden. [ Q ] When he first began training with you he was training specifically to get big for another role or for personal reasons?     No, he was on Will and Grace and he just had a  goal. He wanted to get bigger and stronger. At the time we were actually doing the  Body for Life program together - he is incredibly strong and just ate well. It was just a goal he had. And we did it together.   Body for Life Body for Life is a 12-week diet and exercise program, and also an annual physique transformation competition. It was created by Bill Phillips, a former competitive bodybuilder and the founder of EAS, a manufacturer of nutritional supplements. It has been popularized by a bestselling book of the same name.   [ Q ] And he dropped his body fat correspondingly?     Absolutely!  [ Q ] Was this the first time Sean Hayes had trained specifically for muscle size?     No he had a trainer before at the same gym. He left his trainer and came and worked with me.  [ Q ] I understand you also worked with multiple UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championships) Champion, Matt Hughes. What specifically did you do with Matt?     I actually did not manage his training; I managed his food.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  An Interview With 9-Time UFC Champ Matt Hughes!  Join me as Matt talks about past fights, training, nutrition, off-season, and more right here.   Author: Layne Norton  [ Q ] You were his nutritionist?     Well I am not a nutritionist nor am I a registered dietician, but I still handle many people's food intake, depending on what their goals are. I call this role the food manager. Basically, with Matt, what we discovered was he was eating more like a bodybuilder than an  endurance athlete.   Matt already ate great; I mean he didn't eat bad food. He's not a sugar eater; he's a very clean eater but part of it was he needed to eat way more low glycemic carbohydrates.  When he was training for a fight he was losing up to four to six pounds (bodyweight) a workout so he really needed to make sure he was not burning muscle, and that he was burning up carbohydrates, that he was not consuming at the time. So we just tweaked his ratio of carbs to protein to fats and educated him a little bit on what carbohydrates would really be good for him to eat, that would give him sustained energy.  Part of it is that Matt was already incredibly strong but part of the issue was he would not get his second wind until late into his workout; he would start to really feel strong then. Which is great but the problem was he was eating into his muscle. And he didn't realize the difference. So we changed his post and pre-workout drinks, and his carbohydrates, and put him on Udo's (Choice) Oil and he went great.   RELATED PRODUCT  Udo's Choice Presents: Oil Blend   Udo's Choice Oil Blend is a unique blend of oils and nutritional co-factors that meet all of the esential fatty acid needs of your body. An ideal 2:1 ratio of omega 3 and 6 essential fatty acids, proven by research to benefit cardiovascular health, enhance stamina and energy, and improve general health and well-being. [ Click here to learn more. ]  [ Q ] Just to clarify, what benefits did Udo's Oil give Matt?     Udo's (Choice) Oil is a pure blend of a 2:1 ratio of  omega 3 and  6essential fatty acids; it is in a glass bottle and it is made from an incredible  company that is based out of Canada. The oil helped with  recovery; it helped to load more lean muscle tissue on him and he took it pretty consistently. That was something that he changed.   He also works with Nutritox, which has great products as well. So he was on a really good combo of the right amount of supplements without overdoing it and also getting most of his nutrition from real foods, which is what he prefers.

[ Q ] So prior to you managing Matt's nutrition, he already had a good diet but just needed to make a few subtle changes, nothing too drastic.    Yes, absolutely. He just needed to change his  carbohydrate ratio and understand what carbs, from low to moderate, were the good ones for him to have as opposed to high glycemic carbohydrates.  [ Q ] What were Matt's measurable results?     Matt never, ever complains and never whines or anything about feeling tired or sore. So his thing was really the sustained energy throughout his long training. He splits his training throughout the day and he was just able to do it and he wasn't having the bonking as much. He wasn't hardcore bonking; it was just a matter of having more sustained energy for him throughout his whole workout.  [ Q ] Did his performance in the Octagon improve?     I don't know really. Another thing: Matt didn't eat enough  greens before and I think he became a real  broccoli man so that was good. He was not big vegetable eater and we really tried to get him to eat a lot more green vegetables so he would have more good  fiber and carbs. I think he felt a lot better after doing this. We also took away his red meat during his training phase.  [ Q ] He would have got his creatine and iron from supplements?     Yes,  Nutritox took care of that.

Ashley was chosen as the Bodybuilding.com Personal Trainer of the Month because of her dedication to improving lives!   Author: Ashley Borden  [ Q ] When you are working with a bodybuilding athlete versus a mixed martial artist, would you tend to increase protein and decrease carbohydrates?     Well I think it depends. If it is someone who is really in competition, for the art of being absolutely as lean as possible, I would hand that off to somebody who is an expert in that area because that takes a lot more specific science; to get somebody to three percent  body fat. I would probably have somebody work with me who has worked with bodybuilders before so they could help manage it.  [ Q ] You specialize more in body transformations?     Yes, absolutely - body transformations and also getting the job done. For instance when Matt and I were in Hillsborough,  avocados were really out of season. But we went to this Mexican food restaurant and I said, ""Lets just ask the manager if they get shipments of avocados from somewhere else, lets see if they can get you a whole crate of them."" And it is just where if the athlete doesn't have it they won't eat it.   Matt had so many other things to worry about. It is kind of like I make sure they have all of their supplements, and all the foods they need so they have the least amount of things to think about. They can then just consume the food and worry about their training.   2008 Bodybuilding.comTransformation Guide! Whether your goals are to gain motivation, make a personal transformation, lose fat, gain muscle, or both then look no further. [ Check It Out Here! ]   [ Q ] You mentioned avocados a moment ago. I have found with my own clients that using avocados as a healthy source of fat is an excellent idea as it really fills the individual up and satiates them while providing valuable nutrients.     You know what, it is great. I have really found that there is a fat shortage. People with their diets are like, still living in the '80s and not eating any good fats. And I really found that increasing your good fats, especially from avocados, supports a host of health benefits, and it's also satiating for people who maybe psychologically love butter or cream cheese or spread: they can use avocado as a spread and the texture of it is really creamy and good and it helps to satiate people who might be used to a certain taste.

Every single one of my clients, whether they are professional athletes or a stay at home mom, all learn the same basic system which is basically called the LIFT system (Lift Integrated Systematic Training) and that way I approach everybody, bodybuilder or non-bodybuilder, in a way that assesses the body in the most aesthetically correct way.   I start with them taking their shoes and socks off and I look at the arches of their feet when they are standing in a neutral position. So I start from there and depending on how the arches look, this will give me a compete map of the chain of the rest of their body.  If somebody comes to me and says, ""I can't get my back and triceps up or my rear deltoids just won't develop,"" the chances are they have probably more a collapsed arch and they have forward head carriage and they are not even aware of it. And they are not posturally aligned. The training that I do really focuses on all of the postural stuff, the postural muscles and the whole kinetic chain; very biomechanics-based.   Editors Note: One of the most prevalent postural deviations is called anterior head carriage (or forward head carriage) and is usually the result of sitting for prolonged periods with the head tilted forward (as in sitting at a computer desk all day long).   Mothers who breastfeed or parents in general who spend time leaning forward to attend to their infant or child also experience this problem. This problem causes excessive neck strain and can seriously affect everyday movement and performance. It can be corrected with the help of a professional like Ashley Borden who teaches correct postural alignment.    [ Q ] That's a smart approach.     And I incorporate a lot of myofascial release, a lot of that.  [ Q ] Can you explain this concept further?     Myofascial release is, in layman's terms, is a very deep tissue massage, basically. For instance I worked on Matt when his shoulders were feeling tight. There is a way of working certain pressure points, and moving the muscle around releases the muscle so it becomes more open and stringy and more blood flows through it.   So when you go to train you haven't just stretched a tight muscle with a lot of muscle adhesions, you have actually opened up the muscle and all the tissue. So then when you stretch it, it is able to stretch in a healthier manner in the tissue rather than making the knot tighter so it won't stretch. It's great.  I do it with all of my clients and most of them use a PVC pipe as opposed to the white foam rollers that a lot physical therapists use. I go a little bit deeper than that and like to use a PVC pipe. It's an integral part of the system (LIFT), the training session as well. They ""roll out"" for about ten minutes before they train.  [ Q ] It sounds like you could actually change the shape of a muscle through myofascial release.     Absolutely. I mean quicker than anything I've ever witnessed in my life. It's great for body changing.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Self-Myofascial Release.   What are the differences between the rollers? There are the plain white foam rollers, and then there're the high density ones for advanced users.   Started By: galapogos  [ Q ] With a biceps peak, for example, through this method you could free up the muscle belly itself to promote additional growth.     Exactly. And for somebody who has a really tight  biceps, they are not going to be able to really get their  triceps to fire or become more sculpted. So you have to release the biceps so they can fire or contract the triceps.  [ Q ] Moving onto some of your other celebrity clients, what did you do specifically to improve the shape of Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore in terms of both diet and training?     I trained Christina for about three and a half, four years, stopping two years ago. I went on tour with her and trained her in LA; also did her strip tour with her.   When I started working with her she was very young and had a naturally skinny body, and Christina really wanted to work on her strength and training. And she was more reluctant about her food, so over the course of time it was really just educating her in more of a passive way - how changing her food will affect her stamina onstage.  If she wants she will be able to perform a lot longer and not feel like she will crash from it. When they got the menu for the venues I would look to see what food would be in there. I would then change things to make sure that we had turkey slices and vegetables as opposed to just Doritos and Jolly Ranchers.  [ Q ] That sounds like a full-time job for you?     Well it was a full-time job (laughs).  [ Q ] So you would put all of your other clients on hold while you dealt with Christina? Is that how it worked?    If I was touring with her I was with her 24/7. When I was at home (in LA) I was seeing her four times a week.  [ Q ] What strategy did you use with Mandy Moore?    With Mandy, when I trained her we got her into the most phenomenal shape I have ever seen. Mandy was somebody who grew very quickly; she's very tall (5' 10"").   When we first started working together she did not have really good proprioceptive work and balance and did not feel in very good control of herself muscularly, so we really worked on her posture. She had some spinal issues and we had to work on myofascial release - being rolled out.  Click Image To Enlarge.Mandy Moore And Ashley Borden. [ Q ] Did she become very strong as she progressed?     Yes and her  endurance improved also. Absolutely. When she learned how to control her body she became incredibly, 100 percent stronger. She was like a different person. She moved like an athlete as opposed to somebody who had no control over her body.  [ Q ] Did she train for anything specific?     She had been dating Andy Roddick when I first started working with her and, again, she was doing it because she just wanted to. She had never trained before. And again I had met her at a gym and she was training with somebody else and then she asked if she could work with me.  [ Q ] Over what period did you train Mandy Moore?     From 2004 to 2006, and Christina was probably three years ago.  [ Q ] How long do you train an average client?     For one hour.  [ Q ] And how long would their transformation take, on average?     My average client stays with me for about four to six years. RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Personal Training!

Author: Ivan Blazquez  [ Q ] Who has been your easiest celebrity to train and why?     Annabeth Gish is the easiest celebrity to train by far. She is a phenomenal actress. She is like an athlete; she really understands the body and has done a lot of her own work on her own body and on her training. She loves the systems that I teach and she can do an incredibly  focused, very slow specific workout, or I can just kick her @ss all over the gym. She is just a lot of fun to train: just a normal person.  [ Q ] People who want to train are generally the easiest to train. Right?     Yes. When I trained Mandy, Mandy was good. She was there to train three or four times a week. She came to every gym session; very low key and not a diva at all. But I would say that Annabeth is probably the most fun to train.  [ Q ] When you talk about divas, do you mean those who place a lot of unnecessary demands on you as a trainer outside the training spectrum?     To me when you are training, you are coming in to train, focus and then leave. It's a focused, serious hour of doing the work that I want to do with them. Some people, male or female, don't respect the time or respect themselves enough to take the training really seriously.   Just having me wait is one thing. I've had clients who have had me sitting there waiting in the next room while they are on the phone for 45 minutes. Then they get 15 minutes of training and wonder why their body is not changing.  [ Q ] No respect for your time.     Yes and these people I find don't have respect for themselves as well, so it usually goes hand in hand.

[ Q ] Your lips are sealed for now.     Well you know I honestly don't feel there is anybody I could not work with. I'm able to do my work and not be as emotionally involved as I think some people might be.  [ Q ] How often do you have people who cause you to wait while they are on the phone?     I have had that happen many times.  [ Q ] And these are mainly celebrity people.     Probably, yes. I actually had a celebrity client once who wanted to  smoke a cigarette during the training session. I am not kidding.  Smoking Articles:  Effects Of Smoking And Drinking On Bodybuilders! - By Herve Duchemin Stop Smoking For Better Health! - By Dave Draper Smoking & Musculoskeletal Pain! - By Mauro Di Pasquale Other Smoking Articles...  [ Q ] Who was this, a rock star of some sort?     Not even a rock star; that is the worst part (laughs). You know I think that is sometimes part of the whole game when working with celebrities.   I think what's really important is that there are so many really great trainers out there that don't train celebrities that should give way more attention to other people. And that's something that I have always been aware of; that my training and education is probably 100 percent way more important than who I train, but I guess that who you train is what makes it interesting for people.  It's sad because there are a lot of phenomenal trainers that have an incredible amount of information to give out, but because they don't train celebrities, people don't care. It is just that they don't have a vehicle to get the information out so easily.  [ Q ] Now that you are an established celebrity trainer, do people seek you out to train them, or are you always looking for potential clients? How does that work?     It is usually word of mouth. At our gym we have a team of people, so generally it is like a network of people. Part of it too is if you work with that population, you respect their privacy and ""get"" that it is just part of your job. You are not the rock star; you are working with them.  [ Q ] And there is a special code of conduct and confidentiality protocol that governs what you do with celebrity people versus the general population?     Yes, absolutely.  [ Q ] You would sign a waver before training each celebrity?     Yes I have had to do that many times.  Click Image To Enlarge.NIKE Stretch Photo. [ Q ] Who is the most interesting or eccentric person you have ever trained?     You want me to name people?  [ Q ] Yes, or just give me some more examples. The person who asked to smoke while training sounds crazy to say the least.     I would say the person who wants to smoke while training is more of an addict (laughs) or has a death wish. Even if there was something negative to say there is nobody who I could talk about (laughs).  [ Q ] I guess it all comes under the confidentiality agreement.     Yes, and you still want to work in this industry.  [ Q ] For people who read the gossip magazines and wish to emulate a particular person, like Brad Pitt for example, what advice would you give them?     The first thing I would say is before you go obsessing over wanting to be somebody else, I would first take a look at their body type and make sure that it is a  body type that is similar to yours. If you want to look like Elle McPherson and you are 5' 2"" it is never going to happen.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Brad Pitt's Training!   Pitt's physique first gained national attention when he took his shirt off to kick the @ss of his alter ego in the movie 'Fight Club.'   Author: Brian Bullman  [ Q ] So be realistic.     Yes, look at the body structure and the body type and know that no matter what, you will have to have a similar or the same body type. I even say to people, to wish that you were a celebrity or look like one, the energy you put into this could be put into improving yourself; what you want to improve about yourself, not what you want to look like.  [ Q ] The by-product of that approach would be better mental and physical self-development.    Yes you have to identify what it is you really want.  [ Q ] What is your take on people who become obsessed with the way they look and their training in general?     Well I recovered from some eating problems, compulsive exercise and everything, and the gift (I have) is that I understand it. I had a professional  Karate woman who was very much an over trainer. She would train three times a day and her body was just continuously breaking down.   There is a lot of psychological stuff that goes along with over training. It's a step-by-step process, like anything. Whether it is under training or over training. With over training people sometimes think what a great thing to have, but it can incredibly damage your body and break you down way quicker than you think, especially as an athlete: it can end their career much quicker.  Overtraining Articles:  Overtrain If You Don't Want To Gain! - By Robert DiMaggio Overtraining: Signs & Solutions! - By Fawnia Dietrich High Frequency Training: Avoid Overtraining! - By Mike Mahler Other Overtraining Articles...  [ Q ] I suppose on one level you would be a counselor, helping people to make positive lifestyle changes; developing their mental approach. Which would, in turn, assist their training efforts and enhance their life in general.     Oh definitely because I feel like, for myself because I had such a mental change - had to change my life and how I approached everything - that I really feel like many people have disordered eating - not necessarily an  eating disorder. I think that when you are able to break it down, that does help.   You need to keep a journal. That is one big thing I have my clients do - always keep a journal. Even if they just set an egg timer and write a stream of consciousness for ten minutes at the end of the day, they will be a lot less likely to binge or overeat because they are able to stop their feelings somewhere and not have them be in their food, which is usually a huge trigger.  Also they can see in their own handwriting how great they feel when they are training and eating well. Your own handwriting is a much better way of identifying, ""Oh that's right I did feel that way before."" As opposed to just trying to remember the times when you did feel great.  [ Q ] What exactly is a stream of consciousness?     A lot of people say they don't want to write in a journal; that they don't know what to say. So I'll say, ""Do this."" So you don't have to worry about the time and you don't have to feel like it is an overwhelming amount of time. People usually aren't used to writing.   The thought of sitting down and writing for an hour seems like forever. So I usually say use something like an egg timer (so you know when it begins and ends) and set it for ten minutes.  Get out a piece of paper and start by writing. You might feel like you don't know what to write, but that is your stream of consciousness. Write what you are feeling and slowly it will just start coming out. It is just like a practice in journaling for people who have a hard time putting pen to paper.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Importance Of A Journal.  A lot of ppl come on here and ask about how do I get big, it is especially wide spread in the teen section how do I get big.   Started By: Abyss  [ Q ] So you just write it all out regardless.     Yes, if you don't know what to say, write that out. Just write out exactly what you are thinking in the moment just for ten minutes. Chances are you will get to what you want to put on paper.  [ Q ] Or you may have to go back to decipher what you have written to make sense out of it all (laughs).     (laughs) Correct, I would say you are playing detective with yourself.  [ Q ] If somebody comes to you with a body image problem, what would you do? Have you ever encountered this in any of your clients?     Oh yeah. The body image problems I encounter with men are usually: they either think that they are way smaller than they are - and that's a big one - or no matter what they do they constantly think that they are small. They want to be bigger or they don't see themselves as big as they actually are.   Also men, or women, who are heavy their whole life growing up, it is the same thing: they look in the mirror and see themselves as that overweight little kid still, even if they have an incredible body. That's why I think a lot of it is the mixture of the mental and the physical; you kind of have to heal both.  [ Q ] No matter what they achieve in the gym they are never really satisfied with how they look.     Exactly.  [ Q ] Have you ever encountered someone who is so obscenely large but feel they are really small?     Men who use steroids in general really are people who are hiding in their bodies. Steroid abuse, while not as prevalent where I am, which is not at Gold's, is seen commonly. You will have guys who use Winstrol and they don't talk about it. That's the thing: if you are going to do steroids then tell people that you are doing them. There are a lot of people who don't know much about steroids and they think if that guy is big they might get to that level too.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Steroid Temptations!

Author: Myron Mielke  [ Q ] If people were more honest about their drug intake it would not provoke unrealistic expectations in others?     Yes, but I understand it is illegal. And number two: it is still not worth it in the big scheme of things. There are pros and cons to it. But it is like anything else, if you are cheating and you don't want to tell people you are cheating. I think it is just better if you tell people what you are doing.  [ Q ] If a guy is on steroids and decides to stop taking them, is there a possibility that he will become very unhappy?     Oh yes, are you kidding me? Absolutely. It's an addiction; steroids are addictive. I have been very close to steroid addiction; it is awful. Steroid abuse leads to so many more negatives in your life that have nothing to do with the way you look. You rage and all of that.   Editors Note: Ashley knew someone on an intimate level who was using steroids for many years.   [ Q ] If someone has a body image problem to begin with and then takes steroids will he compound and exacerbate that problem?     Yes, it is that you are not really addressing what is going on (on the inside), you are just putting on a different suit.   CLASSIC QUOTE""You are not really addressing what is going on (on the inside), you are just putting on a different suit."" Ashley Borden on steroid abuse.  [ Q ] But steroids can have some positive uses, if used sensibly, in an intelligent fashion.     Well with steroids you are not even getting performance enhancing benefits. You are just getting bigger. You are not even in a  sport. What are you doing?  [ Q ] So you are saying bodybuilders take steroids for purely aesthetic reasons? But steroids can also improve strength and speed, so in that sense, are performance enhancing also.    And ego. I just want to say, if you are going to do it just be honest and say, ""This is what I do."" I think this would demystify what a lot of men don't get and why they feel defeated when they have been in the gym for six weeks and don't understand why they are not getting the same results and pump the guy next to him who is doing a Deca and Winstrol stack is getting. Then they feel they have to take them too.  [ Q ] It's an arms race with chemicals.     Exactly.   CLASSIC QUOTE""It's an arms race with chemicals."" David Robson on excessive steroid use.  [ Q ] You train celebrities and the average person. Do you take a different approach when training celebrities? Do you have to consider any additional aspects when working with this population?     I am very confident with what I do, thank God, and don't really work from a place of fear. I'm very comfortable with what I do. I trained a very high profile person who was in the Rap industry. He had a very bad reputation and I said I don't train men in their homes and that if he wanted to he could come to my gym, I would train him there.   So I trained him along with another guy. And he did; he trained with me seven times. He showed up, he was on time. He listened to everything I said and there was nothing inappropriate. But it had to be in the setting I was comfortable in. I would not have done it if he wanted me to go and train him in his house.  [ Q ] And who was this person?    I cannot say.  [ Q ] No problem. Do you do any kind of in-home training?     Yes I do in-home training but it really depends on how comfortable I am. Put it this way: that was probably one of the only times where it was an uncomfortable situation. I have had such great clients; I have never had any problems, ever.   This was a unique situation and I didn't feel conformable in his home with him. But he was really cool about it. The key is you have to be very clear and know where your boundaries are and that way you are able to be professional and not feel like you have to compromise anything.

My years of weight training have been in the basement of my parents home and now at my own home gym studio where I do personal training.   Author: Joe Franco  [ Q ] When training a celebrity is there a greater awareness that these people are in a completely different social class and therefore what you do with them might be placed under the microscope to a greater extent?     It is. Christina Aguilera is like nobody else. She is a mega superstar; with her unique set of circumstances and what she has to experience not a lot of people experience so I think a big part of it too is you have to go with the flow. We were ready to train whenever she wanted to train but you also had to be willing to go with the flow. It's just different.   It's not as regimented as when you are training somebody who is in the office at 8:00am and who leaves at 5:00pm. Especially when you are on the road with them (celebrities). Whoever I'm with I just try to make sure they can eat well and drink a lot of water and do body work and train as much as they want to.  [ Q ] In saying all of that you wouldn't treat them any differently than you would an average client, right? Your exercise protocols stay the same.     That's right, everybody is treated the same.  [ Q ] I suppose you would be privy to a lot of secrets being on the road with these people.     Yes. I mean I guess it depends on the client. But that is why they have you sign confidentiality agreements.  [ Q ] Maybe one day you can write a book about your experiences on the road. And then they might sue you, right?     Right and then I will get sued (laughs). But I get it. I get that you want to have people around you in a positive way. People are just so quick to exploit people in a negative way. I just really understand it (what the client wants). I can't imagine having people around you who just want to publish books and write stories about people; you have absolutely no privacy.  [ Q ] But in saying that there can be a fine line between simply digging up any old dirt on someone and publishing something that is relevant, that captures the publics' interest in a positive way; something that might entertain and/or educate.     Yes but if I am in the privacy of their home, it is private; so what I see and hear there stays there.  [ Q ] Very good point. Thank you for your insights Ashley. Is there anything you wanted to mention in particular before we end this interview?

Height: 5'7"" Dress Size: 16  Now: Weight: 140 lbs. Dress Size: 5/6  Why I Got Started  Six months after my second set of twins (3 years ago) I looked terrible. I had a spare tire around my waist and I wore a size 16. Actually size 16 was tight around my middle. Having to deal with two 3-year olds and two infants was a huge challenge. I did not have time to exercise nor did I want to make the time to do it. I was sluggish and had no energy. I was tired going up the stairs. My babies did not sleep well and would be up at alternate hours to breastfeed, which meant I would sleep for an hour get up nurse a baby, put it back to sleep then sleep for an hour and repeat the process all night long. I did not think there was any way I would ever be a size 12 again. I felt so fat and ugly.  It was right at this time that a couple of my girlfriends joined Weight Watchers. I decided to join too. I wanted to get the info I needed for the program and then do the program myself. I weighed in at 183 pounds, 20 pounds more than I weighed when I was pregnant. Within 6 months of beginning the program I had lost 30 pounds. Click Image To Enlarge.Dec 2003 (left), March 2006 (right). I bought an elliptical and used it for a half hour every night doing Steady state cardio. I didn't realize that doing just cardio would burn up the muscle I had, I didn't have any anyways so I guess that wasn't really an issue. After losing the 30 pounds I didn't look terrible in clothes any more but I sure looked bad in a bathing suit or shorts. I had no muscle tone at all.  Fast forward a couple of years now. I went to visit my brother during summer vacation and he had started lifting weights. I tried bench pressing 50 pounds and could do it and thought I was so strong. He showed me how to do squats with a barbell and I was very proud of myself when I did 40 pounds. After I got home I discovered Body for Life. I decided to try that program. I stuck with it for a whole three weeks. The diet was too hard for me. I kept lifting weights but ate what I wanted.  How I Did It In January I was surfing the net and found Buffmother.com. I read her testimony and when I read that she also had twins and I saw that she was totally buff I wanted to know her secret. I joined her rally room site ASAP. Click Image To Enlarge.Download The Free Wallpaper Here!The Buffmother site talked about the wonderful fat burning benefits of having muscles. I learned not to be afraid of lifting heavy, women will not bulk up, in fact opposite. The denser your muscles become the smaller you are going to get, the muscles will burn your fat away.I have been involved in many message boards and most have been cynical and shallow. However the inspiration and encouragement I get from the buff mother Rally room really has helped me immensely, it is just not like other message boards. All the members share their workouts for the day and are really held accountable to get their workout in. I received so much encouragement and information from the rally room that Buffmother has created. I have made some great lifelong friends.  Supplements  Multi-VitaminFish oilGlutamineCreatine  Sample Week Of Training My workouts change every 2 weeks or so. For two weeks I focus on really building my muscles (bulking). I lift as heavy as I can for 3 sets of 5-6 reps. The next two weeks I switch it up and do more of a circuit type of weight workout. I do 3 sets of 10 reps with little or no rest. I still lift heavy enough to challenge my muscles. I focus on getting my heart rate up. During this time (cutting) I do some extra cardio. RELATED ARTICLE  Interval Training For Weight Loss!

No Boys Allowed: 4 Birth Control Fitness Myths
The truth is out there. You just need to know what to read.  Check out these busted myths about birth control, the menstrual cycle and fitness.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/no-boys-allowed-4-birth-control-fitness-myths.html,"We all dreaded high school rumors. Without your knowing how it happened, suddenly the whole 10th grade believed you kissed Coach Knox and were responsible for the heinous x-rated graffiti in the bathroom. It was also rumored that your dad was the caterpillar on the ""Money Tree"" commercials.These rumors had little merit, and were debunked or forgotten after a few days (unless, of course, Coach Knox looked like Jake Gyllenhaal. I wouldn't deny that rumor).I continued to hear rumors throughout my life, including a bunch having to do with women and exercise. I find these particularly interesting because a) I'm a woman and b) I'm interested in fitness.I'm not talking about rumors like: ""If women lift weights, they'll get bulky,"" or ""Women shouldn't take protein supplements."" Those rumors have been strapped to a bottle rocket and launched into the night. No, I'm talking about rumors about birth control, the menstrual cycle, and how they relate to fitness.  ""It's her body. And she chooses to work it!"" The following are rumors I've heard from eaves-dropping, my friends, coaches and the all-knowing Internet. Some of these I spent a good chunk of my life believing; others I know are absolute garbage. The third group, I'm not sure about.My goal now is to separate rumor from science, myth from reality, fact from fiction, horses from unicorns - well, you get the picture.Rumor 1 ""Birth Control Makes You Fat""When I first began using birth-control pills, I was a freshman in college. I was positive they made me gain the dreaded ""Freshman 15."" Apparently, I was not alone. According to a 2003 survey, weight gain is the No. 1 reason women quit taking contraceptives.In theory, there could be biological reasons for weight gain due to contraceptives: fluid retention and/or extra fat due to a hormonally-created increase in appetite. More likely: the weight gain is due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors having nothing to do with ""the pill.""If I consider my college lifestyle - beer, ice cream, beer, sliders, beer - then there's no wonder that Freshman 15 was so thoroughly attached to my butt and thighs. I've yet to find a study showing any sort of correlation between contraceptive use and weight gain. Although it's difficult to do any sort of longitudinal study using humans, there just isn't enough conclusive information to make any determination that birth control pills are responsible for weight gain.Whew! That makes me feel better.Birth Control Makes You Fat: FALSERumor 2 ""Birth Control Makes You Less Strong""Along the weight-gain issue, I've also heard from numerous women that contraceptives can make you weaker. It sort of makes sense, in my head at least, that the more female hormones you have in your body, the less a girl would be able to gain musculature. Boy, was I wrong. A 2008 study of NCAA Division-I female athletes didn't find any significant differences in strength or peak torque gains in women using contraceptives and women not using contraceptives.   ""Who could argue with these facts? Or these lats?"" Of course, the problem with this study is that I'm not a college athlete, and it might be unreliable to use this information to make any sort of decision for us normal people. But this study has given me food for thought.Numerous other studies found that contraceptives may have potential advantages for female athletes because the hormones stabilize the various phases of menses. This could help aerobic performance, muscle strength, and enhanced growth hormone levels. Also, since contraceptives provide some consistency in the body's thermoregulation, the body might actually perform consistently through the menstrual cycle. Neat, huh?None of these studies prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Nor do I assert that taking birth control will boost your gym performance. However, this information does alleviate some of my fears. It also makes me realize I shouldn't eavesdrop in the locker room.Birth Control Makes You Less Strong: FALSERumor 3 ""My Athletic Performance Is Worse On My Period""This rumor is pretty tough to decipher. Of course we don't always feel all that great at that time of the month. And, for some women, feeling crappy pretty much stays all day: whether they're on the basketball court, at work or lying on the couch.However, world records, gold medals and failures have occurred in all phases of the menstrual cycle. Science can't seem to document any significant changes in measures of athletic performance, and it's almost impossible to eliminate the inherent bias that comes with describing the effects of PMS. There are of course, subtle changes that occur in each of us. But again, it's difficult to measure how much this might influence athletic performance.   ""There's nothing subtle about her strength!"" According to one study, some swimmers performed worse during premenstrual times and cross-country skiers have done better post-menstruation. Investigators, it seems, aren't sure how to call this. Neither am I, for that matter. I suppose that our physical capabilities are the same no matter what is happening in our uterus. However, our minds have a huge influence, so perhaps feeling weak, tired, irritated influences how we work out. My Athletic Performance Is Worse On My Period: MAYBERumor 4 ""You're More Likely To Get Injured If You're On Your Period""This is a tough rumor to decipher, too; the evidence conflicts. Scientists base a lot of their studies on subject-answered surveys concerning the menstrual cycle. Getting accurate answers is problematic to say the least; who actually knows when she's in the Follicular Stage of the menstrual cycle? Not me (although I know some balding guys who'd love it).For those of us who aren't collegiate athletes and don't spend too much time planting, cutting, or playing tenacious defense, we probably don't have to worry too much about injuries. Of course, if you're trying to deadlift 200 pounds without even considering using your legs, you're sort of asking for it. Significant evidence suggests that women who have menstrual dysfunction are more likely to sustain injury. Women who spend too much time exercising and not enough time eating stop getting their periods and also experience low bone mineral density. Weak bones make for a weak body. Weak bodies are easily injured. See a trend here?I'd say the jury is still out on this one.

The Shadowy Valley Of Death: My Journey And Re-Birth.
I woke up early this morning, just before dawn. I hadn't been sleeping well for the last few nights, almost endless nights being lost in an abyss of emotions and uncertainty...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simon8.htm,"I woke up early this morning, just before dawn. I hadn't been sleeping well for the last few nights, almost endless nights being lost in an abyss of emotions and uncertainty. I got dressed and started to walk, I didn't know where I was going or why, I just knew that I had to get out of my house, clear my head and get my thoughts sorted.  After a bit of walking I found myself being pulled in the direction of the ocean, there was no fog, no rain everything was clear except my head and some clouds in the distance. I sat on the sand trying to figure out what I was doing with my life, how I was going to get where I wanted to go and how would I make the pain go away.  So there I was looking at the dark sky indulging in the beauty of nature, the only noise was the crashing of the waves, it is unusual to have waves at this beach but the sea always seems to reflect my own inner feelings. I wanted to have clarity like the sky on a warm summers night but I was still filled with feelings of hate, so were the waves.  All Of A Sudden...   I asked myself why I was being tested? Hadn't I been tested enough in my life already? Why was I letting myself get so angry? I realized that I had been angry for to long, it was getting me nowhere, and the comfort of alcohol was no longer comforting. I realized that for a long time I was trying to be someone that I just was not, all of the bull shit that I had gone through lately could have been avoided if I had only had the courage to stand up and say ""NO"".  I had gotten what I needed whenever I had gone against the grain. I was different from other people, I was no messiah or prodigy but I was a unique person that has a lot to offer this world. I needed to think about the situation from a different viewpoint. Most of all I had to let go and realize that I cant control everything but I can control my actions and myself.  See, I had listened to my soul when I decided to get out of the house and return to my focal point in nature. This focal point provided me with a kind of balance in my soul. This was a choice that I knew I had to make but I managed to make it when I had really let go of the situation. How often had I over looked my own inner feeling to be with nature? A lot.  I used to train inside almost exclusively indoors with artificial lights and heating, my world had become very green house in nature. Why? I was scarred to go against the grain. Why? For once I was trying to be someone that I was not.  The waves had almost settled down, so had my inner rage, I didn't need to smash anything anymore, I didn't feel the need to talk to anyone else. I was content in my own world. My own realization of the situation, the need to stop trying to control everything and time out had helped a great deal. See I have always believed that everyone is part of an eternal flow (for lack of a better way of putting it).  When we are going in the right direction things flow easily, when things get hard our flow starts to crash like a wave. We should always work towards a synergistic balance between our lives and nature, it does not matter who or what you pray to, in the end you make the choices and if you make the wrong choices, who is to blame? Only you.  I lay there on the beach, for what seemed like an eternity, happy and content with myself. I had seen where I had made mistakes, my wrong doings. I could also see the path that I had to follow.  In this moment of clarity I was invisible, I heard the ocean calling my name. I decided that following my inner voice so far had lead to great things (on a personal and emotional level) this morning so there I was neck deep in the cool ocean, being the creature of habit that I am I swam slowly out past the jetty, I have always liked to go past this point even when I was told not to. I was not thinking about what I was doing. Once I had reached the end of the jetty I floated there feeling the water around my body, being enveloped in nature, looking at the shoreline, so distant, so small.  I wondered how I could ever have been so angry and upset. I wished for rain. It slowly started to drizzle, the clouds were so beautiful and there in the ocean I realized that the rain could easily kill many people and do a lot of damage, yet when it was light rain there was nothing more life giving or beautiful. For me this was another sign suggesting to me that it is easier to destroy instead of create. Which is what I had been doing to myself, slowly destroying myself.  I decided right then and there that I would follow my chosen path, no more anger or pain. No more slow un-noticed destruction. I felt that nature was challenging me, telling me that if I decided to create instead of destroy it would keep it's promise to me, it's promise was that of always providing enough for me.  It was slowly becoming day, although it was still dark and wet. I felt the distant land calling me back, like a long lost friend trying to find me. I decided to go home. Upon my arrival it was noted by my brother and his girlfriend that I looked like a different person, to a degree that they wanted to throw a party that night because they knew that the old ME was back.  I sat down with my brother and told him about the clarity I had found by listening to my soul. He reminded me that I had always found a way of doing what ever I needed to do, when I needed to, he was just unsure of when I was going to return to my old self. When I asked him to go on with what he was saying he said, ""you have always understood the moment, you usually acted upon the moment and things always worked out well and to your favour"". At that point in time I realized that I needed to embrace the familiarity of challenge.  Embracing The Change   In essence I had given up that which I was in order to become that which I wanted to become. It was also at this point that I looked at my kettlebells; they too had been neglected, why? All my energy had been concentrated with the slow destruction of my now dead/former self. I clean my 24kg bell, it felt so good to be reunited with a dear friend, the slight impact was familiar, and slowly I pressed it, feeling great I pressed it with my left hand. I followed this by some rows and clean and jerks.  How could I have created such a distance from an essential part of my being? This was again a problem that only I had the answer for. Was it slow destruction? Was it laziness? The answer to these question was no! The answer was that I was not myself and I was trying to live my life the way other people wanted me to live it. I vowed that this would not happen again.  I now realize that my morning awakening, has made me believe in myself, I will follow my path and I understand that it will be met with foe's and tests at every advance, but that is ok like I said I will welcome any challenge, it will be what comfort's me even in the hard times.  If your life ever gets to the point that you don't know what is going on and you feel that you are getting lost in the abyss of emotion and you are no longer in control, get out of your seemingly comfortable house, away from all your worldly possessions. Get back to nature and stop seeking the meaning of life and stop thinking that you need to do something that you really don't want to.  ""The true measure of a man is not how he stands in times of convenience or comfort but, how he acts in times of terror and turmoil ""- Simon Why do a majority of us work jobs we hate... to buy shit that we don't need? Remember that the past is dead and what ever you do now is what counts. Also remember ""The true measure of a man is not how he stands in times of convenience or comfort but, how he acts in times of terror and turmoil"" I think that this is relevant.  If times are tough, men and women, stand tall and show nature and the world that you can do what is right for you. Remember to let go of a situation if you can't control it.

The First Ms. Olympia: Birth Of A Tradition!
In 1980, the IFBB sanctioned the first Ms. Olympia, which was staged in Philadelphia by Synder. The success of this competition was a watershed event in the history of bodybuilding for women.  Check out this exclusive coverage from Bill Dobbins!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/billdobbins3.htm,"The modern era of female bodybuilding began in 1977. There were a number of contests for women during the next couple of years, including ""Best In The World"" promoted by Galaxy founder George Snyder. In 1980, the IFBB sanctioned the first Ms. Olympia, which was staged in Philadelphia by Synder. The success of this competition was a watershed event in the history of bodybuilding for women.  This was due in large part to how promotable Rachel McLish, the first Ms. Olympia, turned out to be. Female bodybuilding was extremely fortunate to have Rachel associated with the sport almost from its beginning. With Rachel as the champion, the idea of women developing their muscles for aesthetic purposes was not that hard a sell.  (Click To Enlarge)Rachel McLish in a 1998 photoshoot! Following is a link to my Muscle & Fitness contest report of that first Ms. Olympia, as posted on the getbig.com website. Contemporary fans of female bodybuilding may enjoy a glimpse into the early days of physique competition for women. Many of the names of competitors in that contest are now largely forgotten, but these were the women who helped create the sport as we know it today.  The Coverage  ""My God,"" said the young man, looking in the door to watch the contestants as they signed in before the prejudging at the Ms. Olympia contest, ""I can't believe how beautiful they all are!"" It was a comment that said a lot about the first Olympia for women, as well as the current state of bodybuilding for women in general.  And, indeed, they were beautiful. In street clothes, high heels, makeup, coiffed and resplendent, it was difficult to image that these same women have so often been accused of being masculine, androgynous, or even grotesque. They were none of those things. They were gorgeous.  Patsy Chapman, with the cheekbones of a superstar model; Carmen Lusko, possessing the world's most engaging smile; Rachel McLish, with the long, lean lines of a race horse; Auby Paulick, charm and energy in equal proportions; April Micotra, Stacey Bentley, Georgia Miller, Lynn Conkwright and more - the top professionals, the best of the breed, assembled together to choose the champion of champions, the first Ms. Olympia.  Of course, in one sense, this was not yet an Olympia at all. You can't just call something on Olympia and automatically have an event with the prestige and tradition of the men's Olympia contest. Traditions take time to develop. But you have to start somewhere, and this was an auspicious beginning. Those who claimed it was no more than ""George Snyder's women's contest with a new name"" were simply missing the point.  And beautiful as these young women were, they knew full well they were not here for a beauty contest. Facial beauty matters in bodybuilding, for men as well as for women. It certainly never hurt Steve Reeves. But bodybuilding is more than just aesthetics; it has to do with muscles and physical development, and nobody was more aware of that than the Ms. Olympia competitors in Philadelphia. They had worked long and hard for this contest, And they were ready.  Actually, the contest was only one aspect of an entire weekend devoted to bodybuilding. The Association, in the persons of George Snyder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu and Bill Drake, had planned two days of seminars (featuring such stars as Arnold, Franco, Frank Zane, Mike Mentzer and Danny Padilla), a display of some of the latest developments in exercise equipment and health industry products, and a huge banquet preceding the finals of the contest.  ""The turnout is fantastic,"" George Snyder told me the afternoon of the contest. ""I have had to turn away almost 1,000 people. And more request keep coming in!"" George had expected a good turnout, but this was something else. Actually, the underestimation of audience interest led to the only problem of the weekend - the prejudging was held without an audience, since George did not think that enough people would be interested to justify selling tickets. But the crowd of fans, hanging outside the hall proved him wrong.  ""What happened,"" George explained, ""is that we wanted to use the main auditorium for the seminars, so we decided to use a smaller room upstairs for the prejudging. I had no idea so many people would want to see it, believe me, next year we are going to make sure that tickets to the prejudging are available. As far as I am concerned, if bodybuilding fans want something, they ought to get it. That's what makes good shows, and good shows are what we are interested in producing.""  And so the women stood before the judges and the prejudging began. Dressed in posing costumes, their full muscularity revealed to the eye, there was no doubt now that these women were, indeed, bodybuilders. They were lean and hard, and the shapeliness of their bodies came from the fullness of muscle rather than the padding of fat.  There were 21 contestants in all. Only a handful were not in top shape, and there was one competitor who had no business being in that contest. But Snyder, recognizing the nature of the contest he was presenting, had decided to be lenient in accepting entries.  ""The original idea,"" he said, ""was that an Olympia should only have contestants who had won national titles. But when I looked into it, I realized that a lot of the so-called 'national' titles some of the women had won were really just local competitions with big names - and that some of the best women bodybuilders around might be left out if we tried to be too rigid about the whole thing."" Instead, it was decided to open up the contest to professional women bodybuilders who had won a legitimate competition, and to gradually narrow the qualifications year by year as bodybuilding for women grew and contests proliferated.  ""Doing it this way,"" Snyder went on, ""is better for bodybuilding, for the women and especially for the audience, since it gives them a better show. And, let's face it; if we don't have an audience, women's bodybuilding is going nowhere. The fans are what makes the whole thing possible.""  As Christine Zane, Valerie Coe, Sven-Ole Thorson, Harold Poole, Dan Howard, Mike Katz and Doris Barrilleaux began their long day's work as judges, the seminars were getting underway downstairs. Arnold led off, discussing the psychology of bodybuilding, and was followed by Franco on injuries, Zane talking about nutrition, John Balik answering questions about steroids, and Dr. Anita Columbu discussing women's training.   Christine Zane &  Dave Draper in a rare photo.  When Arnold stood up to address the audience, it was immediately apparent how much bigger he had become, and that he must be back in serious training, But there was as yet no hint of his plans for a comeback.  Pre-Judging  Upstairs, the prejudging was proceeding according to the normal IFBB rules, identical to those used in the Mr. Olympia. There were three rounds in the afternoon: 1. Standing relaxed, viewed from all four sides;  2. Compulsory poses, six in all: two front poses, two back, arms over the head in one, lowered in the other; and two side shots, one from each side.  3. Free posing (the individual's own posing routine).  In the evening, there would be another round of free posing, and a posedown, in which each judge would pick one competitor as the winner. For each first place vote received, a competitor would have one point added to her overall score.  Rachel McLish appeared to be the immediate front-runner. This was only her third contest, but she had won impressively in the Atlantic City competition earlier in the year, did well in the Zane contest, and now looked even better in Philadelphia. It was by no means a sure thing, but there was no doubt that she was the one to beat.  Some of the best-known women were, unfortunately, not in their best shape. Patsy Chapman displayed beautiful shape and proportion as usual, but she was way too smooth. Stacey Bentley was also not as cut up as she had been at the Zane contest. ""I guess I've just tried to enter too many contests in a row, do too many exhibitions, and stay in training too long,"" she admitted later. ""I've seen it happen to the men, and now I know it can happen to me, too.""  A quiet, unobtrusive photographer, armed only with two very small, old fashioned Leicas, took shots continuously. This was George Butler, who had shot the photographs for the book version of Pumping Iron. At Philadelphia, he was taking pictures for an updated version that will include woman's bodybuilding. When the prejudging concluded, it was pretty clear how the battle for first was shaping up. Rachel McLish, no doubt, was a top contender. But she was getting some close competition from a petite blond dynamo named Auby Paulick, who was experiencing her first national level contest. That night, the auditorium of the Sheraton in Philadelphia filled up early for the banquet. Among the hundreds of diners, the competitors say and (most) ate sparingly. In a short time, they would be called backstage to get ready and the show would begin.  After dinner, the audience was treated to a number of guest posers. Ron Teufel got a warm welcome, and came out looking perhaps a little better than he would at the Mr. America a week later. Mike Mentzer appeared, thick as a house. Frank Zane looked somewhat drawn and tired, a result of a training accident in early August.  The high point of the exhibitions was, to my mind, the dual posing routine of Boyer and Valerie Coe. For one thing, Boyer was in phenomenal shape, keeping to his timetable that called for him to peak for the Mr. Olympia. But more than that, there was the excellence of the routine itself: a combination of athletic and aesthetic elements that few men and women teams have achieved.  It was like a pairs skating routine, with Boyer displaying power and athleticism in a number of well-executed lifts, and Valerie flowing with his movements as if she were unconfined by gravity. Now it was time for the show itself. Back in the small dressing rooms, unlike at the men's events, the women were cheerful and bubbling. No drawn faces and withdrawn personalities here. Just some nervous anticipation, a lot of excitement, and competitors pitching in to apply oil to the nearest back.  The Final Showdown  Auby took the stage the way Patton took Sicily. She sent beams of energy into the audience, and the people responded with by far the most enthusiasm of the evening. Auby, it turns out, had had considerable experience as a professional dancer back in her native Michigan, and she is no stranger to playing to crowds. If the contest were to have been decided purely on the basis of audience response to this last round, she would have emerged the clear winner.  Second competitor out was Anniqa Fors, a beautiful blonde Danish girl and discovered by Sven-Ole Thorsen. Anniqa is really just a beginner at bodybuilding but she showed enormous potential. Later we saw Corinne Machado, who showed such quality of development that it was certain she would place well; and then there was Auby Paulick.  It was almost unfair to ask Lynn Conkwright to follow such an act, but if somebody had to do it, she was a good choice. Lynn has such enormous strength and control of her body, she's able to do things in her posing routine that many others cannot, and the audience quickly caught on and gave her their arrival.  Then Rachel McLish came out. Her routine was careful and precise, well though out, but it lacked something - perhaps a certain dynamism, the right kind of energy. It seemed a bit too ""ladylike."" But at the same time, the quality of her physique was unmistakable, so perhaps the routine served its purpose. ""What a thoroughbred!"" Mike Mentzer said in admiration, and that about sums it up.  And The Winner Is...  After all the contestants had completed their posing routines, the top five were called out for a posedown: Rachel McLish, Auby Paulick, Lynn Conkwright, Corinne Machado and Stacey Bentley. If the contest was close, this was a chance for the competitors to make up the difference, and they worked as hard as any lineup of male professionals. And then we got the judge's decision. The winner was Rachel, followed by Auby, Lynn, Corinne and Stacey. It was over. The first Ms. Olympia had been awarded.  Many in the audience were surprised that Auby Paulick hadn't won. After all the spectators hadn't seen the prejudging, so they could only go on what had happened onstage during the evening show. And Auby had clearly dominated that aspect of the show as far as the crowd as concerned. But if we take a closer look at the scoring for all three rounds i becomes apparent what happened. The scoring in the prejudging for Rachel and Auby went like this:  NameRound 1Round 2Round 3TotalRachel McLish989999296Auby Paulick919799286 Notice that, as the rounds progressed, Auby got better and better scores. The reason for this is obvious. Rachel possessed the superior physique. Standing relaxed, it was obvious. When they did their compulsory poses, however, and Auby was able to move, she scored better. When the third round came, and she could use her own posing routine, her score was the equal of Rachel's In the final round at the evening show, not all the judges participated, so the highest possible score was 80 rather than 100. This is how the scoring went:  NameRound 4First Place Votes TotalRachel McLish794379Auby Paulick793368  Once again, Auby tied Rachel, but she was too far behind to win even if all seven judges had voted for her. but the question in the audience would have asked is why Auby, who got such a great response from the crowd, didn't score higher than Rachel?  ""Auby did a fantastic job of entertaining the audience"", one judge told me (a judge, incidentally, who gave Auby one of her first place votes), ""but we weren't there to judge a popularity contest. A lot of what she did onstage had nothing to do with bodybuilding. But, as far as presenting her physique was concerned, I thought she did well and I scored her pretty high. Although Rachel didn't come on to the audience the way Auby did, she also presented her physique well, and I scored her high, too."" Rachel, it seemed, showed an attachment to her ballet training, and may have approached her posing from somewhat too conservative an angle. But this was only her third contest, so she will no doubt develop new routines in the future.  Auby had admittedly not been training very long, and has never trained consistently heavy enough to develop a full muscular shape like Rachel. But the development she has already achieved indicates she had extraordinary potential. If she keeps it up, she had a great future in bodybuilding.  Rachel and Auby are both attractive, charismatic, and are good representatives of the sport. But it speaks well for the Ms. Olympia contest, the judges involved and women's bodybuilding as a whole that, when it came down to the wire, the best physique won the day. When that happens, everybody wins; when it doesn't, we all lose. Thanks,"

Giving Birth To A Better Body — The Belly-Banishing Fitness Plan
See how after having her fourth son, Suz made a personal pact to take her body from low self-esteem to lean in just 12 weeks!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/from-lazy-suzanne-to-wonder-mom.html,"Vital StatsName: Suzanne Michelle Reinhold Email: antvindomnoa4@gmail.com Bodyspace: antvindomnoa4           Before:  Age: 36 Height: 5'2"" Weight: 196 lbs    After:  Age: 36 Height: 5'2"" Weight: 148 lbs  Why I Got StartedAfter the birth of my fourth son, and I knew I wasn't going to have any more children, so I set a goal for myself to lose all the weight I had gained during my pregnancies and to tone up my body.  I was fed up with being a fat and unhealthy mom, I was tired of being tired and cranky all the time. I was always depressed, my self-esteem was incredibly low as was my self-worth! I never wanted to do anything, never wanted to go anywhere, life just sucked. There just had to be more to life than what I was living. That's why in October of 2010 (3 months after the birth of my 4th son) I made a pact with myself to become healthy and fit and to live my life to the fullest every single day.  I realized that I deserved to be healthy and happy, and my children deserved to have a happy, energetic and healthy mom too. I found Bodybuilding.com, read some of the other members stories and saw their transformations, and I thought ""This is just the site for me!"" So, I became a member and created my BodySpace account. Click To Enlarge.I realized that I deserved to be healthy and happy, and my children deserved to have a happy, energetic and healthy mom too.How I Did It Well, first I started by joining the YMCA. A new location had just opened up in my small town in November of 2010. Then, slowly but surely I started changing my eating habits and what types of food I ate. I didn't go gung-ho though. I just focused on one thing at a time. I didn't want to go crazy and start changing everything at once because I would have set myself up for disaster and failure. So, I slowly started cutting out really bad and worthless carbs (bread, cereal, white rice, potatoes, starches, sweets, pastries, etc). I started eating more veggies (which I love) and eating them more often throughout the day.  I also eliminated Diet Coke and started drinking more water. I've never been a water drinkerso this was a challenge for me. However, I purchased a water bottle from Bodybuilding.com and started filling it up several times a day  and NOW I never leave home without it.I wasn't familiar with the machines at the Y and how to use them, so I was a little apprehensive and ""shy"" at first. I just kind of watched everyone else and just followed along aimlessly. It wasn't until December 2010 that I signed up to meet with a personal trainer. That was probably one of the BEST things I ever did! My personal trainer explained everything to me (weight loss, muscle building, cardio, etc.). When I told him I wanted to burn fat, gain nice lean muscle and tone he went right to work. He came up with a specialized program geared just for me. He helped me find out what my 1 RM was and how to use that to challenge myself further.  Then, with my new knowledge, I decided to join the Bodybuilding.com $100,000 Body Transformation Competition on December 29th. This day was the changing point in my life, this is the day that I really became serious about my weight and wanting to lose it. With the program my personal trainer came up with for me, I was able to shed almost 30 pounds and a lot of inches within 8 weeks. I work out 6 nights a week, taking off one day for rest.  Once I set my mind to be fit and healthy, everything else just fell into place. I work a full time job during the day and have 4 children to take care of when I come home. So, most of the time I don't get to the gym until 8 p.m. and don't get back home until 10 p.m. Yes, I'm exhaustedbut my determination is so strong that I push through the exhaustion to keep going.  Now that I see I can literally change my life and my body, I don't ever want to go back to living the way I did in the past. So, I just keep moving forward!Click To Enlarge.

Printable Page PDF DocumentSuggestions for Others My suggestion to others is don't give up! There have been so many times I just wanted to give up and say forget it. But, I kept going and now I'm amazed at how far I've come and how much I have accomplished. If this is what I can do in just 12 weeks, imagine what I can do in another 12 weeks. Keep your head up. Read other success stories on Bodybuilding.com. You will truly be inspired and so incredibly motivated to get up, get moving and keep going. Don't give into excuses! There are so many excuses I could have used (I'm tired, I have 4 kids and don't have time, I don't feel like it, it's not helping because I don't see results) but I crushed them, put them out of my head and just decided to get up and go to the gym. I felt so much better afterward and was glad I went instead of staying home and being a couch potato. Start off slow at first and work yourself up. Don't try to eliminate all your bad habits at once. Start with one bad habit (i.e. unhealthy eating, or becoming more active) and work on that. Once you've accomplished kicking that bad habit, move onto the next one.Use the power of positive thinking. Tell yourself everyday that you are worth it, you are beautiful, you are strong, you are amazing, you are healthy, you're losing weight and becoming healthy. It really works.  The mind is a powerful thing and when you start reprogramming it with positive thoughts instead of negative thoughts everything in your life will be more positive![ View Other Transformations ]You Could Be Our Next Transformation Of The Week!

7 Postnatal Exercises For New Moms
Regaining your post-baby body after giving birth will take some time. Do yourself a favor and start off on the right foot. Here are some safe, smart exercises you can implement right away!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/7-postnatal-exercises-for-new-moms.html,"Vital Stats Name: Kelly Rennie Occupation: Transformation specialist, author of the Fit Mummy Manual, Optimum Nutrition athlete.  Website: kellyrennie.comHaving two kids in two years definitely put a strain on my body. Like a lot of moms, I wanted to start working toward my pre-baby shape as soon as I could. The trouble is, there's a lot of misinformation out there about how long a woman has to wait before she can start being active again. Some people say six weeks; others say three months.I get asked all the time if there's anything a woman can do to start regaining her figure in the first few weeks after giving birth. The real answer is yes. For most women, it is safe and healthy to do some gentle exercise a few weeks after giving birth.*However, the type of exercises you do in the first few weeks after your baby is born should be focused on your pelvic floor and transverse abdominus (TVA). Your pelvic floor is made of muscles and tissue under the pelvis. It's the part of your body that helped your baby rotate and come through the birth canal. The TVA is your innermost abdominal muscle. It's one of the muscles that helped you give birth.The basics of pelvic-floor exercises and TVA breathing are a must. These techniques are a bridge to your normal exercise regimen. These exercises will also help you heal from the inside out, repairing those inner abdominal walls that are crucial to regaining your figure.Aside from giving you a running start toward your pre-baby figure, exercising soon after giving birth offers other benefits. Exercise can boost your mood, help you feel more energized, increase your stamina and strength, and make you feel healthier and happier.SAFE POST-BABY ABDOMINAL WORKOUTSThese exercises focus on restoring the timing and sequencing of your deep muscles, which include TVA, multifidus (small, thin muscles deep in your sacrum), the pelvic floor, and the diaphragm to flatten the tummy faster.For first few days or weeks post-birth, you may not feel your pelvic floor muscles working, but keep going. The feeling will return after a few days.For first few days or weeks post-birth, you may not feel your pelvic floor muscles working, but keep going. The feeling will return after a few days. Trust me, those muscles are working, even if you can't feel them.Workout 1   TVA/Pelvic Floor Activation 10 sets of 10 seconds To engage the TVA and pelvic floor, start by taking a breath in through your nose. Then, as your breathe out through pursed lips, ""lift up"" at your bottom, as if you were trying to stop yourself from passing wind. Next, as you're still tensed at the back, ""pull up"" at the front, as if trying to stop yourself from urinating. Keep the tension going, and gently draw your navel toward your back.   Mini-Crunch1 set of 10-15 reps This is not a full sit-up or crunch. Simply lift your head from the floor a little, and focus on engaging the TVA.   Superman1 set of 10-15 reps Lie on your stomach and make sure your lower back and hips are in a stable position. Reach your arms forward and stretch your legs out. From this position, lift your arms and legs up 2-3 inches off the ground. Hold for 3-5 seconds, and release back down to the ground.   Assisted Heel Drop1 set of 10 reps per leg Lie on your back. There should be a small space between your lower back and the floor. Pull your belly button into your spine and lift your knees. From this position, lower one heel until it touches the ground, then pull it back up. Repeat with the alternate leg.// <![CDATA[quickstart_training_white(""Workout 1"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=TVA/Pelvic+Floor+Activation:+10+sets+of+10+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=10&Exercise%5B%5D=Mini-Crunch:+1+set+of+10-15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=1&Exercise%5B%5D=Superman:+1+set+of+10-15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=1&Exercise%5B%5D=Assisted+Heel+Drop:+1+set+of+10+reps+per+leg&Sets%5B%5D=1&TotalExercises=4&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=Post+Natal+Ab+Workout&name=Workout+1"");// ]]>Printable PagePDF DocumentWorkout 2   TVA/Pelvic Floor Activation 10 sets of 10 seconds  (See description above.)

Put tension on the band by making sure your hands are slightly wider than shoulder-width. Slightly bend your elbows. Pinch your shoulder blades together until your forearms are perpendicular to your body. Release, then repeat. Focus on breathing out as you pull the band wide and engage your TVA and pelvic floor.

Hormonal Timing Program: Women's Fitness Evolved!
I had just given birth to twins by C-section...  My body was stretched out, fat, and disgusting! The following program is designed specifically for women who are fighting the hormone battle while trying to get fit! Take control now, right here!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/hormonal_timing_program.htm,"Are Your HORMONES Keeping You FAT?  Over the past 5 years I've experimented with a training strategy designed for women only. My goal was to create the fastest possible method for women to achieve radical physical transformation. I believed the key was to capitalize on the positive effects of our hormonal fluctuations while also diminishing the negative effects.  I used myself as my first test patient. I had just given birth to twins by C-section which were my 3rd and 4th babies in less than 4 years. My body was stretched out, fat, depleted in every way and just plain disgusting.  At the time, I just wanted to see radical transformation in my body. I had no idea that I was on the verge of discovering something that would change the lives of thousands of women. To make a long story short, my body transformed radically by using what I now call Hormonal Timing  .  Click To Enlarge.Michelle Berger's Transformation.View Her BodySpace Here. I began designing custom Hormonal Timing programs for women online. I charged $1200.00 for an 8 week program. It wasn't long before I was sold out! I simply didn't have time to take on any more clients. The results my clients were experiencing were amazing and I soon realized that I had to develop a way to share this amazing program with every woman in the world, so I wrote a book!  Here is an excerpt exclusively available on Bodybuilding.com.  Hormonal Timing: Female Fitness Evolved By BuffMother! Author Michelle Berger  Foundation #1:Realize That You Are in a Battle!  I'm sure you've felt it: that sudden lack of ambition that just seems to overcome you. You might say, ""This time I'm going to stick to my plan!"" And you do for a while, but then you suddenly realize that you've been slacking for the last 5 days! What happened? You then blame yourself thinking, ""I don't have any self-discipline, self-control, motivation, etc..."" You feel guilty about your lack of willpower.  Maybe you feel like you're close to reaching your goals but just can't quite get there. You work so hard but when you look in the mirror you are always disappointed! You constantly ask yourself, ""What am I doing wrong""? What am I missing?!?  The fact is the vast majority of us have a personal battle going on inside. It may be about your diet, exercise habits, smoking, drinking, scale/weight, dress size, etc.  Every woman's battle is unique but while we fight against all these ""visible enemies,"" an invisible enemy comes along and defeats us. It's our HORMONES! Our hormones are the invisible enemy, and it's time that we learn how to fight back.

""Millions of women fail to reach their diet and fitness goals simply due to their hormones."" This affliction is called Hormone-Induced Failure (HIF) and it will sabotage your success unless you're prepared. I believe that HIF is a huge problem in America!   Are You A Victim Of HIF: Hormone-Induced Failure?   Answer these 4 questions to find out if you have Hormone-Induced Failure:  Are you a habitual yo-yo dieter?Do you periodically suffer from uncontrollable cravings that sabotage your efforts to lose weight?Do you start exercise programs and then quit for no apparent reason?Do you ever suffer sudden weight gain that makes you want to quit trying?Do you catch yourself saying things like, ""I have no willpower"" or ""I'm just not motivated...""? In my experience, most women answer yes to many of the above questions. Most women blame themselves but YOU must understand, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!!  Hormone-Induced Failure (HIF) is to blame!!  Hormones Control Your Diet & Fitness Success!  FACT: Your appetite, cravings, motivation level, mood, energy level, water weight, belly bloat and metabolism are controlled by your hormones!  Hormones control:  Appetite/ junk food cravingsMotivation level/moodEnergy levelWater weight gain/belly bloatMetabolismETC...   Hormones Control Your Appetite (Junk Food Cravings):  Do you have those days when you just wanna eat? I mean really ""pig out,"" on things like doughnuts, cookies, chips, chocolate, etc? It is a sad-but-true fact that our hormones cause us to DESIRE these items.  Click To Enlarge.Our Hormones Cause These Desires. Specifically during the time of the month when your concentrations of hormones are at their highest, you will desire quick easy sources of carbohydrates (carbs), the easiest source being junk food. These carbs spike the secretion of serotonin, your ""feel good"" hormone so-too-often you find your cravings seem out of control.  What can you do to avoid this? Simply, having a plan to eat enough healthy carbs really helps keep your cravings under control, and supplementing your diet with the proper vitamins and nutrients can help your cravings diminish.

[ Top Vitamin Categories! ]    Hormones Control Your Motivation Level & Mood (Mentality)!  The psychological affects of hormones are well documented. According to the Mayo Clinic, there are many symptoms of hormone imbalances including anger, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, irritability, tension and more. An imbalance in hormone levels may cause you to feel sad, lonely, apathetic, self-critical, and unsure of yourself. Just a little bit of being ""down"" can wreak havoc on your diet and fitness efforts.  My motivation to accomplish anything, especially anything hard, often disappears during the second half of my cycle. When I hit day 22 of my cycle, my reason behind working out or dieting gets lost. I say to myself, ""Why am I doing this? I don't want to!"" I also find myself taking less time out for my other needs.  Even simple things like doing my hair, nails, shaving, and putting on make up, become difficult and a pain. Personally, I was never a consistent exerciser until I was aware of my own hormonal lack of motivation, or HIF, and took action against it.  On the positive side of things, the instant your hormones drop, signaling your body to menstruate, your motivation will begin to rise again... and after a couple days you will feel powerful and ready to conquer mountains. This powerful feeling typically continues until a few days after ovulation and when you will feel the ""lazy bug"" hit again.

Learn more about this normal biological function of the female body and how research has changed our perception of this condition.   Author: Shannon Clark  This is when you may fall off your fitness/diet program. Time and time again I have had clients, friends and family who literally ""fall off the face of the earth"" at this high hormone time of the month. This is classic Hormone Induced Failure (HIF).   Hormones Control Your Energy Level & Sleep Patterns:  Do you have days where you are just dragging, limp and lifeless? Yet you can't figure out why? Hormones control your energy levels. Based upon the balance of your hormones in your body your energy levels may be high or low.  Each month, energy levels rise and fall according to the balance of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in your system. If a you are unaware of this cycle when you hit a low energy phase you may think you are just being wimpy, not eating enough, getting sick, etc. BUT, if you know that your low energy is caused by your hormones you will be able to utilize my program to prevent these low-energy days, or at least get through them without beating yourself up about it and losing all momentum. You will be able to honestly tell yourself, I am tired just because of my hormones and tomorrow I will be fine.  As your hormone levels rise toward the end of each month, your sleep may be disturbed, causing energy during the day to be scarce. Often times simply allowing yourself more rest or a nap during this time of the month is all you need to be happier, healthier, and consistent in your fitness efforts.

Hormones Control Water Weight Gain And Belly Bloat:  Oh man! This can be bad!! As a woman, the scale is not your friend for several days of the month. No matter how perfect you may be in your diet and exercise, the scale has a mind of its own when hormones run high.  Your rising hormone levels will cause you to retain water toward the end of each monthly cycle. This is part of why you appear ""soft"" in comparison to a man. Your natural sex hormones help keep your skin full and plump, which is all fine and dandy, until it holds onto 3 pounds more than just the day earlier and fluffs you up so much that your pants don't button!  Click To Enlarge.Author, Michelle ""BuffMother"" Berger. Water retention doesn't just happen in one localized part of your body - it affects your face, hands, feet, belly, butt, etc. Another nasty result of water retention is that our cellulite looks even more dramatic at this time of the month. I point out to my clients that I can actually ""see"" the hormones in them - it is visible as ripples due to hormone metabolites (toxins), especially in the hips, legs and abdomen.  As you become leaner, you will experience greater water weight fluctuations because muscle cells hold a lot more water than fat cells. Don't lose heart when this happens!! It is actually a good sign that you are headed in the right direction with your body composition.   Hormones Control Your Metabolism:  As you go through the month, your hormones effect your metabolism (the rate at which your body burns calories). Documented studies show you can actually burn up to an extra 500 calories per day during the week prior to your period. NO WONDER you feel like you want to eat everything in sight!

Your body is telling you that you need the extra energy. Why then do you feel horribly guilty if you eat a bit more? Probably because you are already bloated and feel frustrated, so eating extra food seems like the worst thing to do.  Don't let guilt turn your fitness quest upside down. Accept that fact that you may need a few more calories right now, plan for that, and enjoy your indulgence. This will enable you to end the cycle of guilty binges and emotional eating before they start. As a result you will build your fitness momentum instead of quitting due to Hormone Induced Failure!   Hormones Control Many Other Aspects That Affect Your Body & Life:   The list of other ways hormones affect you is long but here are a few: digestive issues, allergies, etc. I've personally been concerned about these symptoms from time to time. However after, I connected these symptoms to my hormones, I was free from worry because I knew, ""It's just my hormones.""  Click To Enlarge.Author, Michelle ""BuffMother"" Berger. Every woman is a bit different in regards to her biggest hormonal struggle. But no matter what, there are effects from your hormones--good ones and bad ones--and they must be considered in your diet and fitness program.  The key point to know is that there are nutrients, mental strategies, and physical fitness/diet applications that will help prevent or minimize the bad effects and allow you to capitalize on the good effects.  As you apply the diet, exercise and supplementation principles of my program you will establish consistency which will lead to progressively gaining momentum month after month.

Art Of Figure Presentation: It's All In The Details!
I first started exercising seriously after the birth of my beautiful daughter. I immediately fell in love! Once I did my first figure show, I was hooked! Here are some proven tips for figure success!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/figure_competition_prep.htm,"Article Summary: The NPC has very particular criteria on how to present your physique. A good posing suit will flow with the lines of your body. Be sure to hit the tanning salon regularly as contest time nears.  The Art Of Figure Presentation:It's All In The Details  I first started exercising seriously after the birth of my beautiful daughter, Alexis, to get back in shape. Although I was a recreational athlete in high school, (I did cheer and gymnastics for most of my childhood) I never got very competitive at it. Regardless, I really enjoyed the physical activity and my body responded quickly to the change.  Once I did my first figure show, I was hooked! My first few shows, I did well, with little knowledge of what the sport was really about. I laugh now, because for my very first show, I knew nothing about preparation or presentation.  When they lined us up, ready to go onstage, I simply copied the moves of the girl in front of me! My suit was way too big for me! (I had ordered it online and it just didn't fit properly - kept riding up my bum and I knew nothing about bikini bite!). One thing I will say, though, is that I always had the best color! I learned early on that a good tan was of the utmost importance!  One of the first role models for me early in my career was Japanese IFBB Pro Masae Tagami. She and I trained at the same gym for a time. I learned a lot from her. I would watch everything she did onstage and tried to mirror her.  Click Image To Enlarge.Masae Tagami At The 2008 California State Pro.View More Pics Of Masae Tagami At The 2008 California State Pro. To me, she was so beautiful to watch on the stage. Her make-up always seemed perfect, her walk, her movements, her presentation and overall appearance was so polished and classy next to the other girls, it set her apart. I tried to emulate her. I realized very quickly that presentation is arguably the biggest part of our sport.  One of our local NPC judges, whose opinion I have come to respect over the years, once told me, ""The best physique doesn't always win, Meriza. Especially in figure, if you cannot present yourself properly on stage, it will hurt you in the eyes of the judges."" I thought about this for a long time.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  This Is How I Did It!   Figure for me really started as a hobby. However, in the past two years I have been able to take it to a whole new level!   Author: M. DeGuzman  After watching enough shows, I really started to see the importance of being able to stand properly, turn gracefully, twist and smile with ease, and be able to walk with confidence (especially in those tall shoes!). Poise, polish and presentation - these are the keys to keep in mind to succeed in our sport.   The Turns     In figure, we don't really have ""poses"". There is no ""front double biceps"" pose or ""side chest"" pose, like in bodybuilding. For figure, our judging round consists simply of 4 ""quarter-turns"", and 4 model turns.   The quarter-turns are mandatory turns or body positions you assume in order for the judges to compare you to the girl standing next to you, and to the rest of your competitors.  Click Image To Enlarge.Our Judging Consists Of 4Quarter-Turns & 4 Model Turns.  The model turns are variations of the quarter-turns, involve one hand on the hip during both side positions, with a slight twist to the torso, and a more side-ways presentation to the physique. The model turns are a little more individualized, but still follow a particular format.   The National Physique Committee (NPC) has very particular criteria on how to present your physique correctly, so that all competitors appear in a similar posture, for easier comparisons.

You spend countless hours doing  cardio,  weight training,  eating,  supplementing, doing all the things you need to do to get into competition condition, don't make the mistake of choosing a poorly cut or improperly fitting suit!   Suits are expensive, for sure, but a good suit will flow with the lines of your body. The cut of your suit can accentuate a tiny waist, for example, or hide a blocky mid-section; the right cut can create the illusion of longer legs, or a tapered waist.  Click Image To Enlarge.Your Suit Can Make Or Break You.  And let's not forget the color! Be sure to choose a color that accentuates your complexion. Fairer-skinned girls should stick with darker hues or more subtle colors - that seems to work well (pastels can be tough to pull of with lighter skin tones); ladies with a darker complexion can often pull off a wider variety of colors.   I have all of my suits custom made these days by Bryon David. He's local, but he's the best. He makes suits for all of the top girls. You can contact me for his information. There are several really good custom suit makers out there.  One suggestion is to study your physique, and compare it to experienced girls you admire who have similar structure. Observe the cut and shape of their suits, and be aware of these variables as you work with your suit-maker.

Many girls hire a hairstylist the day of the show to take some of the  stress out of creating a polished look. I used to simply pull my hair back into a ponytail, but I soon learned that overlooking something as apparent as a hairstyle does not help me in any way.   It's the same with makeup. Realize that figure is a stage show. Be sure to apply your make up more heavily and more dramatically for the show. Again, under the stage lights, normal, everyday makeup will not show effectively.  As for accessories, the NPC has specific dos and don'ts regarding jewelry. Be sure to check with your sanctioning organization for rules regarding accessories, too. And, don't forget them!

Body Transformation: Natural-Born Instructor
Jessica left the military because of recurring seizures. After moving states, giving birth and burning the baby fat, her only recurrence is in her training regimen!

I had a teacher who really liked the way I lead classes and encouraged me to start teaching. My junior year I started teaching aerobics classes at a local gym. After I graduated I went into the military. I worked in the Health and Wellness Center doing body composition assessments, nutrition training, and teaching classes. I was medically discharged from the military because I started having seizures. I moved to Florida, got married, bought a house, and then got pregnant a year later. It was a difficult transition and happened very fast. I totally let myself go, especially during pregnancy. When I was pregnant with my son I stopped weighing once I reached 200 pounds. I felt horrible, I had no confidence, and I vowed that as soon as I had my son I was going to get healthy and stay that way. I was determined.    The power potential inside her just needed to be released!How I Did ItAfter my son was born my husband was deployed. I went to Washington to stay with my parents. I joined a gym and started working out. I had that ""I know everything"" mentality so I didn't hire a trainer.After a little while I caved and decided it couldn't hurt. I hired an amazing trainer who pushed me and encouraged me to also become a trainer. I had always wanted to be a trainer and I'll never forget her encouraging words telling me to do it. I went home that night and bought the study materials. I had lost all my baby weight but I wasn't satisfied. I went home and shocked my husband with the new me. Eventually I started teaching mommy-and-me classes in the park, training in people's homes, and training at the YMCA. During this time I took up running.I was never a good runner but it was something I wanted to conquer. I trained diligently and it wasn't long before I ran my first 5K. I was hooked. I loved the environment of races and the thrill. I did several more races and decided I needed more of a challenge. This is when I trained for my first  marathon. I had great running partners to keep me accountable. I ran my first half marathon and said I would never do it again. A month or so later I was presented with the chance to help raise money for The Parent Project for Muscular Dystrophy for one of my client's sons. I decided to do the Goofy. This was a  marathon on Saturday and a full marathon on Sunday in Disney. I completed it with one of my very good friends. It was an amazing experience! After that I needed a new goal. I was getting burnt out on running.  I always wanted to do a figure competition but I never thought I could, especially after having my son and all the stretch marks I had. I found an awesome company to help coach me and was surprised to find out that the tan is so dark you don't even see stretch marks on stage. I competed in both figure and bikini. I won 1st place in figure and 5th in bikini. It was also an incredible experience. Since then I have been running my personal training business and pursuing fitness modeling!

People are roaring to go when they start a new program and many times they start off doing way too much and burn out or they injure themselves. Don't be so hard on yourself. Take everything on day at a time, shoot, even one hour at a time. Remember where you started and how far you've come. Don't forget how you felt when you were miserable, lacking confidence, and dying for a change. Don't forget how excited you were to get your health back. Remember when an exercise kicks your butt. If you hit a road block or have to go through a tough time, remember it. When you remember these things it will stop you from going back to that place. Let those hard times motivate you and inspire you to push forward. Set BIG goals. You will never accomplish anything in life if you don't try to tackle things that scare you. Be accountable. When I told the world I was going to compete that solidified it. Post pictures, share your success, and DON'T pull away from the people who are holding you accountable when you go through a struggle. Reach out.Celebrate your victories - I don't care if its one pound, a pants size, a lower cholesterol reading, or an extra push up. Take the time to celebrate it instead of being so focused on what's next. You Could Be Our Next Transformation Of The Week Male Transformations.

Female Transformation Of The Week - Lara Bross.
Lara didn't realize her body had turned soft until after the birth of her son. Learn more about her amazing transformation as she goes on to lose almost 30 pounds and 20% body fat!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/transf124.htm,"Before:  140 lbs  After:  117 lbs  Vital Stats  Name: Lara Bross Email: lara.bross@comcast.net  Before: Weight: 140 lbs Body Fat: 32%  After: Weight: 117 lbs Body Fat: approx. 10%  Why I Got Started  It was after my son's birth and I was feeling like I had gotten a bit soft. Then, my mom and everyone on her side of the family suddenly started having health problems. My risk factors for some of these health problems, due to family history, startled me into thinking that I was a ticking time bomb.  To top it off, my husband remarked that my butt was getting big! When I had my body fat measured and my ""Before"" picture taken and shown to me, I realized I HAD to do something. I knew I had gotten soft but I really had no idea that I was overweight and out of shape.  How I Did It  I got a personal trainer and started making exercise a habit. After six months though, I noticed I wasn't really seeing much of a change. It was only when I took charge of my diet and cut out processed foods, lowered my carbohydrates, and increased my protein did I see my body begin to change. I lost most of the weight in the next six months and I started building muscle and I liked how it looked.  I had always dreamed of competing but never thought I'd really be able to. Once I dropped my weight, I started thinking about it more. I checked out a show and I was hooked. Around this time, we nearly lost my mother (at 60!) and I started thinking life is just too short. I knew if I was ever going to do it, the time had come.  While training for competition, I surprisingly found that the affects of having tangible goals and feeling great physically, spilled over into other parts of my life: I found self-determination and passion for life - I was smiling and joking more, I was more organized, etc. This discovery helped me decide others could benefit from this spillover effect, so I got certified as Personal Trainer last year.  Click To Enlarge.Lara Bross. In Sept of '05, I tore my ACL and had back-to-back surgeries for my ACL and a hernia repair. Once I recovered from the surgeries, I started training with IFBB pro, Rashid ""Roc"" Shabazz. With Roc's help and lots of hard work and dieting, I placed first in Master's class in August of '06 at the NPC Coastal show. I competed at the Jr. USA in '07 and hope to do one more national-level show with a Master's class this year.  Click To Enlarge.Rashid ""Roc"" Shabazz. Supplements  I use Isopure No Carb protein powder, glutamine, and Branched-Chain Amino Acids to help build muscle and also retain it when dieting for a show.

Saturday - Rest   Sunday - Cardio Only  Stretching for 10 minutes after each weight training session  Suggestions For Others  Consistency is key - you should not expect instant results, but if you keep at it the results will happen and you can reach your goals. Think of it like needlepoint - each stitch doesn't add much, but over time you will see a bigger picture starting to emerge.  Clean up the diet! The biggest factor to changing your body's appearance is DIET. You can work out all you want, but you won't see the muscle if it is covered by a layer of fat. Eating clean and eating often supports a healthy metabolism and puts you in fat loss mode!  A positive mental attitude affects everything!! Stress can mess up all your hard work, so make sure to find ways to keep it maintained. Take it one minute/one rep at a time when things get hard. Make sure to SMILE and have FUN!

Transformation Of The Week - Chell; AKA - BomChell.
After giving birth to so many children one can only wonder how they keep their sanity. Well I suppose the only way to put it is ... you do what you have to do. Some love it, some don't. Here is Chell's story.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/trans35.htm,"Before: Weight: 231 August 3, 2004  After: Weight: 152 Lbs August 3rd, 2005  Why You Got Started?  On August 3, 2004, I weighed 231 pounds, pregnant with my sixth child. She was born August 20 leaving me to lose roughly 70 pounds. The after photo above, taken exactly one year later, weighed me at 152 pounds. In talking to women they often say, ""I look this way because I have had a couple of children."" I would respond: ""Well I have had 5 and adopted one.""  They would ask me how I do it working a full-time job of supporting two teams: 1)IT LAN Help Desk and 2) a production environment working in excess of 50-to-60 hours a week. All the while, volunteering to be the President of our neighborhood pool and managing my own; likewise, volunteering to manage the daycare for our church.  Click To Enlarge.Chell, Mother Of Six. When exercising I found it most valuable to do any cardio 1st thing in the morning before you eat anything. Your body tends to burn 3 times the fat as your glycemic rate stabilized while you were sleeping. (A cup of coffee or tea is OK; it will actually help you get moving faster.) If you cannot do that, then try not to eat an hour or two before you work out; otherwise, you are not really burning fat.  Likewise, it is best not to eat any carbs prior to going to bed. You will not burn them off and will probably be stored as fat. Which I might add if you need to have a little treat, do it first thing in the morning so you have all day to burn it off.  How You Did It?  Once I delivered Cydnee (8-20-04), I was so overweight my knees and the arches on my feet were extremely sore. Since I gained so much weight, partially due to my food intake and partially due to the prednizone I had to take to control the lupus anticoagulant I carry. The anticoagulant can form blood clots that could harm the fetus.  Click To Enlarge.After I Delivered Cydnee. The lesson I learned as I try to get back into shape was I could no longer do what I used to. I had to reassure myself that doing a little was worth it and just try to do a little every day. Unfortunately this was my fourth C-section in which my doctor strongly recommended I wait at least three months to do any weightlifting.  Right after delivery I started walking, then I moved on to light weights while slowly increasing the intensity. I cut out all fast food. I increased my protein levels (tuna, turkey, lean meats, chicken, egg whites and whey protein). Even boiling some of the meats like hamburger and steak to remove the extra grease.  Next I cut down on the sugar carbs (desserts, processed foods such as cereals, bread, bagels and noodles). Good carbs are most green vegetables, brown rice, yams and oatmeal. At health stores it is possible to find cereals and noodles that are lower in sugar carbs. You may pay a little more, however, it is really worth it.  Click To Enlarge.Low Sugar Carbs Are Worth The Expense. You do need to treat yourself once in a while or you will fail. Good cheating things are pizza thin crust, salsa with Tostitos Scoops. They also have sugar-free carb candies and desserts. Just remember ... everything should be in moderation, as they often replace the carbs with saturated fat. Give yourself a cheat timeframe or even a day per week. Even if that means having a social cocktail. I have found drinking rum or vodka with crystal kool-aid a winner. Zero carbs.   What Supplements Did You Take?    Just a  multivitamin a day is all you really need. I bought a ton of books off the internet about supplements and vitamins. I tried them all. Some include:   Vitamin B complex Vitamin C Vitamin E Alpha Lipids Potassium Beta Carotene Glucosamine Chondroitin I never saw any significant change; therefore I researched the multivitamin and found the daily allowance to be sufficient.  I do take fat burning supplements such as Stacker II or III, Ripped Fuel, Rev xp, etc.  Favorite Foods are Wal-Mart's Chocolate Soy Slender Soy Milk, South Beaches Protein Bars, and any Frito Lay chip as they contain zero trans fat.

I found my workouts are more consistant if I set a time for it. If I say that I'm going to do, I do it. I am doing this for me and no one else.   I try to ride my mountain bike during lunches on weekdays for 40 minutes when work is not to hectic. Weekdays I lift for 30 minutes; normally one muscle group, at least 6 exercises, 3 sets, reps vary in range right now because I am trying to increase my muscle strength; I am lifting heavy reps (3-10).  Click To Enlarge.I Am Doing This For Me & No One Else. When I want to get cut, I lift less weights and increase reps with a body pump class that is always to music. On the weekends, I always workout for one hour. I also ride motocross, which I try to do once per week. This really burns calories.  The best way I have noticed in getting my legs more defined is the adductor and low squats. I know guys that think the adductor is a girly movement. However, the biggest powerlifters I have met do those. They are used in every leg movement you perform.  For biceps I like the 21s: 7 reps from bottom raise to waist, 7 reps from waist to shoulders, then 7 reps full curl.  Click To Enlarge.21's Using The Curl.

So I do squats, sissy squats, toe raisers, adductors and leg extensions while holding her. Makes great for extra weight. Good news for moms: babies usually fall asleep during the squats.  Likewise my kids sit on my lap while I place my hands on the bottom step with straight arms. Then I bend my arms and do a tricep dip. I try to include them as much as possible to make it fun plus they are always around.  Shoulder lifts I can do with my 4-year old laying across my arms and good mornings with her laying across my shoulders. Even my 14-year old wants i on this action. She will sit in my arms while I do shrugs.  Click To Enlarge.I Try To Include My Kids As Much As Possible. Abs For Women     It is more important to lift the legs up to your waist vs. crunching down. Do 2/3 more   leg ups,   Roman chair, or   windmills than anything else.     Working Out With Children   Getting back in shape after having a baby requires excellent time management! The more you can work child's play into your workout, the more time there is for everything else that needs to be taken care of during the day.

After giving birth the body needs help to restore the sexy physique that was once achieved.  Having a baby can be a lot of work. Feeding, cleaning and nurturing aside, getting your body back in shape can be one of your toughest assignments.  Workout What Is The Best Workout To Shed The Pregnancy Weight? Be Specific.  Be sure to have your diet in check and have medical clearance before starting out the weight-loss program. Eat nutritious foods every three hours for the entire time you are awake. Keep the fat intake minimal, but focus on healthy fats.  As you are nursing your baby, you don't want to lack in nutrition in the first place, and severe under-eating can also cause problems in this area. This said, do not drop caloric intake rapidly!  Now, if you haven't been active during pregnancy, don't jump right into intense workouts. But, each day, be sure to do at least something active. Starting out, going for a walk (also showing off your new baby) around the neighborhood or parks is a great way to do something. Then, start working up to faster-paced cardio exercises like jogging, swimming or cycling.  Click To Enlarge.Going For A Walk (Showing Off Your New Baby)Is A Great Way To Do Something. If you really want to control your calories, weight-training can help you build and maintain muscle, which burn calories much more than fat does and will tighten up your body. Not only that, but you may even improve your look and fitness more than it was before! I personally recommend mainly all compound exercises, which really helps overall muscle stimulation rather than certain muscle groups.  For example a sample week of weight training and cardio can be as follows:   Sunday: Rest Day:   Monday: Legs:  Lunges - 3 x 6-10Wide Stance Barbell Squat - 3 x 6-10Stiff-legged Deadlifts - 3 x 6-10Leg Extensions - 4 x 6-10Seated Calf Raise - 4 x 6-10  Click Here For A Printable Log Of Monday.

Remember, just because this workout has you doing some sort of activity each day does not mean you won't have time to take care of your baby or enjoy yourself.  Some of these days' workouts will take only 20 minutes to complete. On Saturdays, do the cardio or HIIT, but instead of abdominal exercises try to attend a yoga session. This can help not only strength and flexibility, but also can help you relax from your hectic schedule.  RELATED ARTICLE  What Is The Best Yoga Workout?   Probably everyone knows at least one person who swears by yoga. However, there are many different types of yoga to choose from.

How Long Does It Take How Long Does It Take To Shed The Weight Using This Program?  The timeframe to get your body back to your pre-pregnancy weight depends greatly on your commitment. Obviously, if you're not willing to stay true to the meal-plans and workouts, your goals won't be met nearly as fast as if you are dedicated.  Click To Enlarge.The Timeframe To Get Your Body Back To YourPre-Pregnancy Weight Depends Greatly On Your Commitment. The plan I put together for my sister took her about 8 months to get her body pretty close to what it was before pregnancy. Fortunately for her, she only gained about 25 pounds of ""pregnancy-weight,"" which helped the process not take nearly as long.  Like any ""cut"" program or weight-loss plan, do not plan on losing more than 2 pounds every week. Starting out, this will be tough to do, and more than this will put excess stress on your body (that has already gone through an ordeal) and may make it harder to maintain the weight loss.

After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries.    Author: David Robson  Bonus Question What Are The Best Supplements To Take Post Pregnancy? What Supplements Should Be Avoided?  Right after you've delivered your baby, try not to get right into supplements. Like any workout program, try to reach your goals first without help of supplements. If you find your progress is slow then read up on products you might be interested in. If you require a protein supplement, soy, hemp, wheat and whey are viable options.  If whey is your weapon of choice, be sure to use whey protein isolate for this type of program. Another reason to not rely on supplements is that you will be breast-feeding.  Artificial sweeteners found in many supplements, including proteins, might not be optimal for the baby's sake. Obviously, fat-burners and other products high in stimulants should be avoided. For the baby's safety, just play it natural starting out.  A good multivitamin is also useful for anyone on a workout program.

Pregnancy is a beautiful part of life, but it is also one of the times in a woman's life when weight gain is for all intensive purposes unavoidable.  Perhaps one of the most detrimental parts of the pregnancy emotionally can occur after the birth of the child. There you are, no longer pregnant, but with much more fatty adipose tissue than before.

How Long Does It Take How Long Does It Take To Shed The Weight Using This Program?  With the use of this program, you can lose that unwanted pregnancy weight in no time at all, assuming you have your diet in check. I've always said that in weight loss, diet is more than half of the battle, so you should absolutely check out some of the diet articles that Bodybuilding.com has to ensure proper caloric intake as well as the right types and kinds of foods for you.  Keep reading, because the more you learn about getting to that healthy weight and being able to maintain it, the better off you will be in the long run.  Keep in mind, the idea behind why this workout will work in addition to your diet is that this workout will help you build a little bit of muscle, which will increase your metabolism and multiply the effects of your cardio. This is why the people you see on the cardio machines at the gym day in and day out never lose weight; they're just burning calories as well as muscle, keeping their metabolism low and slow.  Resistance training is key in ensuring weight loss. And don't worry about putting too much muscle on, because it's a slow process and you will have time to decide if you're getting too bulky or not well in advance. Keep working hard and you can succeed before you even know it.  Bonus Question What Are The Best Supplements To Take Post Pregnancy? What Supplements Should Be Avoided?  The absolute best supplement to take post pregnancy would be whey protein. Supplementing with protein not only will help you make gains in lean muscle, it also requires more caloric input to digest, making your body burn more calories throughout the day. Now I know it may seem silly to you to be drinking a protein shake, but it really isn't as odd or out of place for woman to do that at all.  Almost all of the best female athletes out there supplement with whey protein, and don't you let anyone tell you any different. They'll be the ones envying you and your new sexy little body a couple months from now, and they will bite their tongues about how they might have criticized you about drinking protein shakes.  Definitely try out Syntrax Nectar. It's one of the best tasting protein supplements out there, or if you prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners; I'd advise trying out Optimum Nutrition's Any Whey.   RELATED PRODUCT  Syntrax Presents: Nectar   Leading scientists assessing the true role of fats in increasing lean muscle growth have shown all fats are not created equal. [ Click here to learn more. ]  On the other end of the spectrum, you don't want to be taking any supplements that could be harmful to your health. Although many other people may disagree, I wouldn't advise a person to take stimulants or fat burners post-pregnancy, especially if you're nursing the baby.  There are a number of supplements and ingredients out there that don't have tons of research backing them, and although may not be harmful to you they could be harmful to the child. Stay away from anything that your doctor says to avoid, as they know best and want you and your child to stay as healthy as possible.

Looking For The Buff Chick Within.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/par20.htm,"In my teens, I was all ""knees and elbows"". In my 20's I was obsessively thin.  At 30, after giving birth to my second child, I felt my metabolism lurch. Suddenly I couldn't eat all that I wanted and stay perfectly thin. Although I never reached the stage of being overweight, I knew that the slowing of my metabolism would not improve and I would be gaining weight for the rest of my life if I did not change something. My family told me that it was natural to gain weight in my 30's-and so it is-but I was not one to be content with developing a ""mature figure"". I bought a Tae-Bo tape, later a copy of Body-for-Life, and eventually The Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding. I joined a gym and found a veteran bodybuilder to train me.  As my body began to firm and change, I looked for information on what I should do to continue to improve and found that there was comparatively very little written on how women should train differently than men. Much of the available material discussed the socially attractive side of female fitness, the toned look. Simply ""toned"" did not seem to be what I wanted since I was already thin, but I also knew that I was not destined to look like Lenda Murray. I wanted a look between these end marks; later I realized that what I wanted to achieve was a fit, lightly muscled, but highly feminine look. My quest for knowledge has eventually been rewarded by an ever-expanding web of information, and by a vast amount of self-discovery.  Check Out Dozens Of Female Training Articles, Click Here!  As my body has developed, so has much more. The gaining of strength in my arms and my legs is proportional to an increase in strength of mind and spirit. Strangely, for me, the biggest reward of bodybuilding, has ultimately come down to increased confidence as manifested in not only physical power, but also in increased control of my mind, spirit, and body.  How Working Out Has Helped Me  In its simplest form, confidence comes down to vanity and with the outward changes in my body has come the simple enjoyment of my increased attractiveness. For the first time in my life, I get noticed in public and I wear shorts and sleeveless shirts without hesitation. Being lean and lithe and firm is often cause for an increase in attention from both sexes; however, being a woman, this can often be negative as it is inevitably said that a thin and fit woman is ""lucky."" The fact that she sweats it out in a gym an hour or more each day and denies herself those extra cookies is of little note. I have born much criticism from family and friends about being ""obsessed"" and needing to ""live a little.""  What is often dismissed as shear vanity in a female is often, in reality, a sense of pride and increased self-worth that comes from enjoying the payoff of that hard work in the gym. Beyond that simple pride comes a deeper confidence that if I can change my body, I can change my life. I am in control. I see much less hesitation in my manner and face most tasks these days with a sureness that I never before possessed. As I learned that lifting a weight at a particular angle developed a specific segment of the muscle, so have I seen that looking at an outside issue from disparate angles can more fully develop the mind. As I have learned to be patient and control both the positive and the negative movements of the weight, so I have learned patience in other aspects of my life. Control causes an increase in development and strength in many areas, not just bodybuilding.  And finally, I have realized the simple physical pleasure of possessing strength. I can lift more, run harder and am more active at 34 than I was 10 years ago. Hundreds of articles and books and web sites are dedicated to listing the various benefits of weight and cardio-vascular training, but it comes down to feeling good and feeling strong, being able to do what you want or need with a minimum of help. Physical strength is its own reward. The independence that accompanies increased physical strength further increases confidence in my own abilities.  So it follows that I am happy with the progress I have made, but I can never see a point when I will be content to stop improving my body, as I hope to never reach the day when I have nothing more I wish to learn. So where do I fit into society?  Bodybuilding is still a rather unconventional sport for women. For every group of guys lifting hard in the gym, there will be a singular female. Generally, women are accepted once we have been noted as being dedicated, but to other women we are still very much on the outside. It becomes tiresome explaining that: no, I am not afraid of getting big, or yes, I really do eat carbs, and finally, NO, you CAN NOT see my stomach! Women have even been so bold as to ask if, at my low body fat, I still have a period. My grandmother illuminated the ""fact"" for me that it just wasn't feminine to push my body so hard and men did not LIKE girls with muscles; women were meant to be soft.  In confronting such gender Stereotypes, I appreciate that my body has natural, genetic limits, and that it is inherently unique, and thus responds to training and dietary changes as such. My mind however is far less limited than my body and my range of perception is inexhaustible if only I choose to open my eyes and my mind ever wider.  As to my Granny's belief that men do not like women with muscles, I will agree to a certain extent, as there are men who indeed are not attracted to ""buff"" women, just as there are men and women who do not prefer redheads or tall girls. But there are another group of men who do not like muscular women more on the basis of what the muscle signifies about that woman. A woman who is in good shape is a woman who has goals and obvious strength; she must be dedicated to strengthening her body, and she will usually be unafraid, if not proud, to show it. Some men do not like the manifestation of physical strength because they feel that it somehow lessens their own masculinity to be seen with such an obviously strong female, but others like less the signs of personal pride and character in a fit woman's appearance, which all but scream that this is indeed a woman who can achieve and will not be held in check if she does not want to be.  Conversely, there are men who are attracted to that lone woman sweating it out in the squat rack, not because of her looks so much as because HERE he sees determination and more than physical strength, HERE is character. This woman has the pride and self-respect to build her body and the courage to persevere in spite of some harsh criticism. A man who recognizes this woman as being someone outside the norm also knows that these character traits will follow this buff chick beyond the walls of the weight room.  Why Bodybuilding Is A Personal Sport  As I proceed in with my own insatiable quest for perfection I find that this is a personal sport and we each gain different insights from it. I have learned to make better use of my other gifts as I have developed the confidence to change my body. I have learned that any changes that I wish to make in my life are up to me to make. When I get up and go to the gym at 4:30 a.m. to improve myself, it is for me that I am going, and it MUST be only for me. This strength that I find inside can only be useful when I develop it to please myself; it is not a gift that I can give another person, nor something I do to please those around me.  While it is nice that my husband likes my stomach and it is great that I am asked how I got arms like these, when it comes down to it, at 4:30 every morning, it is up to me to do what needs to be done in the weight room. And after that... it is up to me and only me to do what needs to be done to keep improving myself for the rest of the day.

5 Factors And Risks Of Amenorrhea In Women!
Reproductive function is a health concern for both male and female athletes. Learn more about the factors and risks of amenorrhea to keep your body balanced and healthy for the rest of your life!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/5-factors-and-risks-of-amenorrhea-in-women.htm,"Article Summary: Amenorrhea is caused by low levels of GnRH and LH hormones.The level of body fat needed in order for normal menstrual function can differ.After removing the interfering factors, the menstrual cycle should begin again.  Reproductive function is a significant health concern for both male and female athletes and, for those who use anabolic steroids, the concern becomes even greater. While men may experience changes in libido and natural testosterone production, the effect training, dieting and anabolic steroid use has on the female body is immediately noticed via changes in the menstrual cycle.  In fact, many female athletes report menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea (the absence of periods for 3-12 months). There are several reasons for this disruption in the normal menstrual cycle, the most frequent cause being a dysfunction at the hypothalamic level - often referred to as functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.  Put simply, the hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which regulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones are released by the pituitary gland and are involved in regulating the release of other key hormones (e.g. estrogen) from the ovaries.   What Is The Hypothalamus? The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis).  When there is an absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), this means that a suppressed level of both GnRH and LH levels has been observed. This suppression can be caused by many factors and is not just related to the use of anabolic steroids. For example:  1. Low Body Fat  Female athletes often have very low body fat levels - this is especially true of women bodybuilders who diet to reduce their body fat levels well below what could be considered 'healthy'.  The level of body fat needed in order for normal menstrual function can differ from individual to individual. There are many textbooks out there who throw out percentage requirements (usually around 8%) for maintenance of the menstrual cycle. However, some women can fall below this and still experience a regular cycle.  On the other hand, some women can experience disrupted cycles when their body fat is over 10%. This is where individual body chemistry comes in to play. Another factor which plays an important part in menstrual function is...  RELATED POLL How Often Do You Diet?   I always diet and exercise. I go on diets every now and then. I never diet.    2. Training Intensity  When women undertake high-volume/high-intensity exercise programs they often exhibit significant changes in gonadotropins, cortisol, and testosterone levels. Add to this a reduction in body fat level and the presence of anabolic substances and it is not hard to see why the menstrual cycle decides to go on vacation.  There is just too much hormonal chaos to deal with! You have also got to bear in mind that the whole menstrual cycle is there to facilitate procreation. In order to support the growth of another life form, the body has to feel that ample sustenance and a healthy environment is present, and intense exercise, low body fat, and an extreme diet could hardly be considered as healthy in this instance. Click To Enlarge.When Women Undertake High-Volume/High-Intensity Exercise Programs  They Often Exhibit Significant Changes In Gonadotropins, Cortisol, And Testosterone Levels. 3. Dietary Restrictions  Low fat, low carbohydrate diets can also result in significant changes in circulating hormone levels. Any form of dietary restriction can create nutritional deficiencies and place stress on the body.  When calorie restriction is severe the production of adequate hormones to allow menstruation to occur is not on top of the body's 'to-do' list. Keeping you alive is! You have to remember that your survival is of ultimate importance and the body will do whatever it needs to conserve energy so that vital functions are maintained. In this case menstruation is not a vital function. Click To Enlarge.Low Fat, Low Carbohydrate Diets Can Also Result In Significant  Changes In Circulating Hormone Levels. 4. Anabolic Steroid Use  The use of anabolic steroids by female athletes is often responsible for a range of menstrual irregularities including the complete cessation of the monthly period.  Certain steroids like Nandrolone, Oxymetholone and Ethylestrenol are known to inhibit ovulation and trigger amenorrhea. However, the amount of these substances used would also play a significant role when it comes to inhibiting menstruation, as would individual body chemistry.  In fact, when it comes to the effect anabolic steroids have on the reproductive system individual body chemistry is key. There have been many reports of women taking small amounts of testosterone and still maintaining a regular menstrual cycle - although such individuals are definitely the exception rather than the rule.  On the other hand, some women can lose their monthly period on small amounts of Anavar due to its interference with the estrogen/progesterone cycles  5. The Health Risks  When there is a prolonged absence of menstruation there can be a substantial change in bone mineral density and an increased risk for osteoporosis. This would be less of a concern for women who use anabolic steroids although it would still be important for those athletes to pay attention to the acid balance in their body and to keep their calcium intake high.   What Is Osteoporosis? Osteoporosis is a disease of bones that leads to an increased risk of fracture. In osteoporosis the bone mineral density (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture is disrupted, and the amount and variety of proteins in bone is altered.  The verdict is still out as regards the long term health risks of amenorrhea and some women even welcome the reprieve from their 'monthly visitor'. In fact some forms of contraceptive pills are designed to reduce the amount of periods a woman has each year so that would lead us to believe that it is not necessary to menstruate every month.  One thing is for sure though, the menstrual cycle is pretty resilient and once all the factors that have been interfering with it are removed it usually returns in a few months at most.  Whether this return is welcome or not depends on how you view its presence in your life. I know some women who feel lost without their period while others consider it totally liberating.

HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation: The Holy Grail Of Optimized Natural Human Performance
The first and most important How-to answer in the optimization of human performance begins with HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation. Learn more...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/core_june_3.htm,"During the 70's and early 80's supplement makers had little to offer in the way of anything useful for athletes, okay, other than vitamins and poor quality protein powders that tasted like sweetened dog food. Well, actually it was mostly animal grade soy protein with sugar added so I guess it was.  In the 90's, a few viable performance-enhancing options such as creatine monohydrate and whey protein made their way into the market thus finally offering health and performance oriented alike something of statistical value.  What Happened?  In today's media-hysteria-managed environment, athletes, supplement companies and drug dealers alike are seen in the same shady light. Why? In the new millennium performance enhancement through supplementation became a science. (No joke, really!)  As the better companies employed more real scientists, they became more apt at researching and marketing substances that truly could be said to be ""steroid-like"" in effect. And of course, the pharmaceutical industry, sports organizations and government agencies took interest. The pharma industry because of money, sports organizations because players wanted more, and the government because of both reasons.  It has to be a sad state of affairs when a society has reached a point in its ineptitude that government intervention is deemed necessary as a means of controlling individual choice for performance enhancement, or not, from over the counter supplementation. Yet the only qualification required for purchase of enough alcohol to kill ones self is 21 years of age and the capacity to say ""Bud"".  After all, no one seems appalled by the unfair advantage performance enhancement drugs like Viagra (sildenafil citrate) and Cialis (tadalafil) allows cheaters. (Don't get me started on the unfair advantages women with large breast augmentations have over post-nursing mothers...Okay, like I care)   Are Viagra & Cialis Unfair Advantages Or Divine Blessings?  Unfair Advantages. Divine Blessings.      We're Not In Kansas Anymore...    As a result of today's media-hysteria-managed environment, everyone wants to write a tell-all book and government intervention, we have moved into an era of supplementation skepticism leaving only a few options left to truly innovative supplement makers. Well, at least those with an interest in the future of our industry and an authentic interest in the edge science can offer athletes (and every day normal people as well):  Work to maximize human performance through health promoting physiological optimization (WADA, IOC and pro-sports friendly)  Bring on greater government intervention and regulation for the entire sports and supplemental industry.  Move to Mexico where no one cares what you do to yourself...and take lots of Viagra or Cialis.  Where To Start  The first and most important How-to answer in the optimization of human performance begins with HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation: The Holy Grail of optimized natural human performance enhancement.  Before I go on, realize that this is the catalyst for all of the good things you really want to happen if performance optimization is your goal...so take the time to read it!  The human body has the ability to naturally produce amazing amounts of anabolic goodies like testosterone, GH (growth hormone), IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1) and insulin. It also has the ability make more thyroid hormones and other fat burning substances than you could ever reasonably want (never met a reasonable bodybuilder but I did hear of one once)  In regard to everyone's favorite naturally occurring man-making androgen, testosterone is king of the muscle building anabolics...and your body can make WAY more than you need through HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation.   Warning: Science Geek Stuff (That Actually Matters)    Both men and women produce testosterone naturally, but here lets primarily focus upon the men. (I will show you a diagram of how the ladies do it as well anyway for the curious)   Endogenous (made inside the body) testosterone production is predominantly a result of, and governed by, the HPTA (Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis). It all begins with a gland located in your head called the hypothalamus when it releases a measured amount of GnRH (also known as LH-releasing hormone).   What Is The Hypothalamus?  An integral part of the limbic system, the hypothalamus is involved in regulation of the internal milieu of the body or, said another way, for homeostatic control.  It does that by means of its neuroendocrine role in conjunction with the pituitary gland as well as by its influence on the the autonomic nervous system, which helps regulate body temperature, the cardiovascular system, and food and water intake.  The small amount of GnRH then makes its way to the pituitary gland to tell it to kick out two other hormones called LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone). Nope, the job is not done yet.  Okay, LH and FSH then take a trip via the vascular system to the testes (testicles, ""The Boy's"", testes... whatever) and make contact with the Leydig cells and Sertoli cells ...which results in testosterone synthesis and sperm production respectively.  HPTA Function Pathways    The amount of GnRH, LH and FSH produced regulates the amount of  testosterone, androstenediol and  DHEA your body produces...or not. If the HPTA produces supraphysiological amounts of GnRH, LH and FSH, it actually also produces more performance enhancing goodies like testosterone, androstenediol and DHEA by way of overcompensation. Getting the idea here?   THAT is HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation. The Question You Really Want To Ask... Why Don't ""My Boy's"" Do That Naturally?  Like all things we really like in life, there is a series of checks and balances that keep things in control and limit the amounts of good stuff we can have (like girlfriends). In the case of HPTA-function and optimized testosterone production, it is due to 2 primary negative feed-back loops. (Most know this first one, but let's recap to be sure).   Estrogen Negative Feed-Back Loop    High estrogen levels are not the sole propriety of women with amazing sweater puppets and bizarre mood swings. Men produce it too, and in most cases, there is way too much in any man's system than nature meant there to be. This also helps to explain way males produce less testosterone and sperm today than they did only 2 generations ago.   This is due significantly to un-natural (exogenous) exposure to the overabundance of plant-derived phytoestrogens (such as those found in soy products) and xenoestrogens in plastics and herbicides today.   What Is Xenoestrogen?  Literally, xenoestrogens are estrogens that are foreign: i.e. not produced in ones own body. (Xeno comes from the Greek, meaning strange or foreign.)  Thus estrogen produced by a cow (which is present throughout the meat) is a xenoestrogen. As such if one eats beef, one is eating a xenoestrogen.  Unless of course it is a bull and then one is eating xenotestosterone.  Don't get me started on chemically raised meats and pesticides either.  Natural (endogenous) estrogen is predominantly made in the male body from the aromatization of endogenous (made inside the body) androgens (such as testosterone) into estrogens. This is the responsibility of an enzyme called aromatase that is present pretty much everywhere in the body...even the brain around the hypothalamus (remember that).  When too much estrogen interacts with the estrogen receptors of the hypothalamus, there is a negative feed-back loop that tells the gland that there must be too much testosterone as well. The result is a dramatic unhealthy reduction, or even shut-down, of the HPTA and girl status for the owner of the saggy-sack problem. But it gets worse...  Click Here For The Top Selling Anti-Estrogen Products.  Androgen Negative Feed-Back Loop    The hypothalamus also has lots of androgen receptors for sensing the level of testosterone and other androgens circulating in the body. When too many androgen receptors of the hypothalamus become activated, there is a decrease or even total shut-down in GnRH release. This means that ""The Boy's"" pretty much have nothing to do because the lack of GnRH release also means no LH or FSH release.   So the end result is your testes have no reason to produce testosterone or sperm...and no reason to optimize muscular activities, recovery or have sex. Hmmm, look bad, feel bad and not care. That is ugly. Anabolic Steroid Users & Saggy-Sacks  The reason most AAS users employ the drugs is to un-naturally increase their testosterone levels to 2-5 times what is so-called natural or normal. Of course the results are obvious: Increased muscle mass, decreased fat mass, a marked increase in metabolic rate, better focus, and improved performance in every manly area. The bad results are all of the negative side-effects from excessive estrogen and lipid issues that synthetic androgens can cause.  Normal total testosterone production for a healthy male is about 500-600ng/dl (too many are in the 200-350ng/dl range due to environmental estrogens alone), but some AAS users push the levels into the 2000-3000ng/dl plus area. As a result of all of this excess testosterone floating aroundthe body, there is a lot of aromatization to estrogens and an overabundance of androgen receptors of the hypothalamus being over-stimulated. The outcome is obviously the loss of testicular function due to both negative feed-back loops occurring.  Many AAS users know that by decreasing the amount of circulatory estrogen, they are also able to somewhat decrease HPTA down-regulation. Post-cycle AAS therapy, in most cases, includes something to decrease estrogen levels and activity, and some other drug to replace LH. If done correctly the end result again is an increase in actual natural testosterone product 1-2 times above normal for a brief period.  Clomiphen, Anastrazole and HCG...Oh My (The Most Common PCT)  PCT stands for Post-Cycle-Therapy and refers to HPTA regeneration or stimulation. Anabolic steroid users and those looking to increase endogenous androgen production alike, have used this so-called stack almost like a religious rite not realizing there was an error in its structure.  Clomiphen Citrate is the generic name for Clomid which is a fertility drug used to stimulate ovulation in women and increase sperm production in men. Clomiphen citrate is actually a very weak estrogen in itself. It works by blocking more powerful and active estrogens from merging with the hypothalamic estrogen receptors. The end result is the hypothalamus ""perceives"" that there is less circulatory estrogen and responds by increasing GnRH release. In addition there is some degree of decrease in estrogen activity throughout the rest of the body as well for the same reason. As a rule 50mg daily for 2-3 weeks of clomiphen citrate has been noted as effective for this purpose.  Anastrolzole is a generic name for the drug Arimidex. This is an aromatase enzyme inhibitor that decreases conversion of susceptible androgens into estrogens. This action results in a decrease in total circulatory estrogen. As little as 1mg 3 times weekly post-cycle for 30 days has been shown to decrease estrogen by 50% and have some benefits in regard to HPTA regeneration due to its mopping up effect.  But this combination only helps clean up the effects of the Estrogen Negative Feed-Back Loop leaving the Androgen Negative Feed-Back Loop unaffected.  HCG refers to Human Chorionic Gonadotropin. This is a hormone that is produced by pregnant women and used in fertility medicine. In males, HCG has been shown to mimic LH thus administration results in direct stimulation of the testes resulting in minimal increases in sperm production and significant increases in testicular testosterone production.   Human Chorionic Gonadotropin  Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, or hCG, production begins approximately 8-10 days after conception when the embryo starts to burrow itself into the lining of the uterus.  It is this hormone that is measured by early pregnancy tests and if present, will return a positive result.  An hCG beta blood test is much more sensitive than an HPT, and can detect pregnancy as early as 10 days after fertilization.  Interestingly enough, this pregnant woman's hormone is effective to a point that some studies have shown it to be able to prevent testicular dysfunction during anabolic steroid use. But again, that is a whole other article. Most have realized notable HPTA recovery and/or androgen production stimulation form administering 1000iu HCG 3 times weekly for 21 days post-cycle.  Hmmm, still nothing to ""positively"" affect the Androgen Negative Feed-Back Loop.  Action/Reaction... And Things That Go Hump More In the Night  The ideal situation would be the ability to decrease estrogen levels in the whole body while decreasing androgen activity of the hypothalamus specifically. Of course we would not want to decrease androgen receptor activity in other peripheral areas like muscle tissue, and we would want focused estrogen control around the hypothalamus to create the best performance enhancing synergy naturally. Can that be done? Of course it can, just as Nolvadex is way more specific to breast tissue, some really cool compounds are WAY more specific to the hypothalamus.  The result would be long term HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation and viable naturally occurring testosterone production at a significant and highly effective level. This would (and has) obviously allow for optimization of human male performance. That is a perfect example of correct application of the body's natural health promoting Action/Reaction Factors.  If you have read this far, then you already realize that I have explained the physiological and environmental factors that foster an un-natural chain of events resulting in significant reduction and limitation for every male's performance...in every aspect of the word.  If you are interested in legal and natural ways to optimize male physical and mental performance (and improve the fun of what goes Hump in the night) then read on.  We Had To Start Somewhere...   Chrysin    Sometime in the early 80's Dan Duchaine proposed that a plant aromatase called Chrysin (Flavone X) was comparable in effect to the well-known biosynthesis inhibitor/anti-aromatase Cytadren (Aminoglutethimide).    Dan Duchaine, 1952-2000 Known as the Steroid Guru, Dan Duchaine was the author of The Underground Steroid Handbook. He died from complications related to polycystic kidney disease on January 12, 2000.  Fellow writer and friend Will Brink set up The Dan Duchaine Memorial Fund in his memory. Contributions can be made by sending donations to: The Dan Duchaine Memorial Fund, c/o CEO Steve Evangelista, National Kidney Foundation, 129 Morgan Drive, Norwood MA02062.  This was due to the structural similarities the two compounds possessed. Dan was sharp (he kept us all thinking), but he missed on this one. In truth Chrysin totally bombed out in the real-world as it is actually just another phytoestrogen making male users fat and less masculine.  AT    Until recently the only well known and statistically effective OTC supplemental anti-aromatase for systemic (whole body) estrogen control was delta-4-10, 13-dimethyl-cyclopenta[a]phenantrene-3,6,17-trione (A.K.A. 4-androstene- 3,6,17-trione) or ""AT"" for short. (One trade name for it was Aromax by Applied Lifescience Research Industries Inc.).   One main concern with the ""AT"" structure is its potential conversion to the feminizing estrogens 6-keto-estrone and 6-keto-estradiol (Estradiol's of any kind are as much as 10 times more powerful than estrogen's).  Naturally there is a dose dependant issue here which is a supplemental oxymoron: Low bioavailability means higher dosages needed, that in turn result in greater amounts of AT being converted to the feminizing estrogens 6-keto-estrone and 6-keto-estradiol. Read on, you will understand better...  Depending upon bodyweight and level of estrogens in a man's body, at 600mg daily AT appears to be reasonably useful, and in truth it was the only viable option for sometime.  The main limitation for this compound is that it has poor oral bioavailability (the reason for required dosages being above the half gram mark daily), and of course it only aids inhibition of the Estrogen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop.  This is not to say that it was not a useful compound. However, the Androgen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop still remains the main limiting factor.  Synergy Key To An Optimization Matrix  There are some very effectual options currently coming to market that have viable research behind them that specifically address both the estrogen-negative-feed-back-loop and the androgen-negative-feed-back-loop on multiple levels.   3-O-WHO?    6,17-dioxo-etiocholene-3-ol (A.K.A. 3-OHAT) is a natural occurring metabolite of the popular anti-aromatase supplement 4-androstene- 3,6,17-trione (AT) mentioned prior. It possesses a much longer half-life (stays active in the body longer) thus allowing for improved efficiency from a single daily dosage. Additionally it is noted as a non-androgenic aromatase inhibitor. This means that 3-OHAT is an excellent fast-acting long-term destroyer of the testosterone limiting Estrogen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop...and does not stimulate androgen receptors of the hypothalamus and the Androgen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop. Studies have shown that even acting alone, 3-OHAT increases HPTA activity resulting in more testosterone production via natural pathways in humans and animals.   ATD & Focus    3,17-dioxo-etiochol-1,4,6-triene (A.K.A. ATD) has a prolonged affinity for the estrogen mediating aromatase enzyme. In fact, it is actually about 2.8 times more powerful than AT for this reason. So great, it is more powerful than AT and even more powerful than 3-OHAT in a different way. Big deal?   In vitro studies have shown ATD to be a powerful androgen receptor blocker of the hypothalamus...but not of peripheral androgen receptors. What's this mean in English? It means that ATD blocks the Androgen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop and aids in decreasing estrogen production while increasing natural testosterone production. (If you are paying attention and focusing a little here, I am sure the real point of this article just hit you)  Synergy    There is a need for synergy in anything in life and physiological Action/Reaction Factors are no exception. As you know by stopping Both negative feed back loops, the hypothalamus will produce more GnRH which in turn means that the pituitary will produce more LH/FSH and ""The Boy's"" will kick out a whole lot of male optimizing testosterone. Sounds good in theory?   Of course some studies have shown that the correct ratio of 3-OHAT and ATD administered to adult human males results in an average increase in bioavailable testosterone of up to 400% and a direct decrease in estrogens of an average 50%. (No joke!) Up to 4 times the man and half the girl is not a bad natural improvement for a lad.  Okay, But What About The Real World...  I personally do not believe anything I cannot prove myself in the lab. As such we used 8 healthy males as human guinea pigs to test what the research claims to be factual.  4 acted as a placebo base-line group receiving 6 capsules daily of cornstarch, and the other 4 got the real deal consisting of a proprietary 50mg blend of both 3-OHAT and ATD.  During the pre-administration period we tested for Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone and Estradiol, then tested again at 14 and 42 days.  Results:   Placebo Group     No significant changes (Gee, are you surprised?) in total or free testosterone and estradiol.   Subject 1 (24 year old male)    Pre-testing:         Total Testosterone: 350ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 83.00pg/ml        Estradiol: 39pg/ml        14 Days         Total Testosterone: 1803ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 522.20pg/ml        Estradiol: 27pg/ml        42 Days         Total Testosterone: 2895ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 839.20pg/ml        Estradiol: <20       Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone & EstradiolClick To Enlarge.

Subject 3 (25 year old male)    Pre-testing:         Total Testosterone: 555ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 104.00pg/ml        Estradiol: <20        14 Days         Total Testosterone: 1624ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 405.7pg/ml        Estradiol: <20        42 Days         Total Testosterone: 1837ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 547.40pg/ml        Estradiol: <20       Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone & EstradiolClick To Enlarge.  Subject 4 (51 year old male)    Pre-testing:         Total Testosterone: 584ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 13.40ng/dl        Estradiol: 47pg/ml        14 Days         Total Testosterone: 851ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 26.10ng/dl        Estradiol: <20        42 Days         Total Testosterone: 875ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 30.30ng/dl        Estradiol: <20       Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone & EstradiolClick To Enlarge.  Interpreting The Data    Test results showed a net increase in total and free testosterone ranging from 50-800% with a significant reduction in estradiol of about 50%. More importantly is that the elevation was maintained for a long enough period to allow notable benefits from a physiological stand-point (weeks, not just a few minutes). Huh, go figure, the studies are right.   Conclusion  Testosterone is the anabolic steroid that all other AAS (Anabolic-Androgenic-Steroid) are compared to...and your body can naturally and legally produce far more than you actually need. Most negative side effects come from the use of AAS, not from the excess of natural endogenous testosterone itself.  Click Here For The Top Selling Natural Testosterone Products. I would like to see the results from the same test subjects using the 50mg 3-OHAT/ATD proprietary blend with the addition of Agaricus bisporus extract (white button mushroom from a specific region) and 7b-hydroxy-DHEA. The Agaricus bisporus extract because the right method of extract provides some very effective site-specific aromatase enzyme inhibition, and the 7b-Hydroxy-DHEA because it is preferential physiological base compound for many good things.

Soy Facts & Recipes: Vegetarian-Friendly Protein In A Positive Light!
Soy protein is not only the fountain of youth; it's a great insurance policy against a number of illnesses... Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/soy_protein_facts.htm,"We all have women in our lives we love. In the US one in four women die of heart disease. Soy protein is not only the fountain of youth; it's a great insurance policy against a number of illnesses, including heart disease. In addition, soy can alleviate countless menopausal symptoms and is a healthier alternative to animal proteins. Heart Health  Of the 500,000 annual deaths from cardiovascular disease, 267,000 women die from heart attacks - six times as many women as will die from breast cancer.1 Ingesting 25 grams of soy protein every day, may reduce your risk of heart disease. ISFLAVONES Isaflavones comprise a class of organic compounds, often naturally occurring, related to the flanonoids. Many act as phytoestrogensin mammals. Being polyphenols, they are antioxidants. Some isoflavones and osoflavone-rich foods possess activity against cancer, incuding certain types of breast and prostate cancer.  Isoflavones found in soy are the antioxidant compounds responsible for this positive effect. Research has found that these powerful antioxidants may improve the health of the lining of blood vessels, which in turn can reduce the risk for heart disease. 2, 3 In addition, they may also inhibit certain negative effects of LDL-cholesterol, known as ""bad"" cholesterol, making the LDL-cholesterol less damaging to arteries. 4, 5Soy and Diabetes  Heart disease is one of diabetes' major complications. Those with the disease need to pay extra attention to the positive effects acquired from ingesting soy protein. This is because soy protein foods can help to maintain optimal glucose and insulin levels which is critical for Diabetics. 10Soy's Cancer Fighting Effects Genistein and PhytoestrogensGenistein is one of several known isoflavones. Isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are found in a number of plants, soybeans, and soy products like tofu. Textured vegetable protein is the primary food source. Phtoestrogens, sometimes called ""Dietary estrogens,"" are a diverse group of naturally occurring non steroidal plant compounds that, because of their structual similarity with estradiol, have the abilty to cause estrenic or/and antiestrogenic effects.  Soy contains cancer-fighting phytos. The phytonutrient most prominent in soy protein products is genistein, which has been shown to have anti-cancer properties. 14 Soy protein also contains phytoestrogen, which has been shown to reduce the risk and spread of prostate cancer. 14Soy and Menopause  These wonderful isoflavones found in soy protein, have also recently been found to inhibit post-menopausal bone loss. Several studies have been done comparing bone density in American women and Chinese women who intake a considerably greater amount of soy. The studies showed that the Chinese women were one-third less likely to break a bone. 6 What is even more interesting is that one study showed that the effects of isoflavones seem similar to standard hormone therapy, which is known to decrease risk for fractures. 7  These effects are a great option for those who are concerned with the negative side effects that hormone replacement therapy may cause. These side effects include nausea, bloating, increased risk of heart attack, stroke, negative effects on mood to mention just a few.  Aside from the fact that healthy protein levels make for healthy looking hair, soy isoflavones have been found to alleviate women's problem with hair thinning during menopause. Hair loss during menopause can occur as a result of falling progesterone levels caused by ovulation cessation.  Soy isoflavones provide estrogenic effects without the risks involved in using synthetic hormone replacement therapy and thus improve thinning hair. 8  Isoflavones found in soy can also help relieve hot flashes. Scientists have observed that women in Asian countries, where soy is a regular part of the diet, are less likely to report hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms than are women in other parts of the world. 9 Soy Protein Is Just Better!  Soybeans are considered by many agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, to be a source of complete protein. 11 A complete protein is one that contains significant amounts of all the essential amino acids that must be provided to the human body because of the body's inability to synthesize them. 12 For this reason, soy is considered to be a great source of protein for vegetarians and vegans.  Yet soy is not just for vegetarians, it is a good replacement for animal based protein since animal based proteins tend to contain more fat, especially saturated fat. Aside from that, soy is easier on your tummy! Between 30 and 50 million Americans [are] lactose intolerant. 13  Symptoms of lactose intolerance following consumption of dairy foods include, gut pain and distension, flatus and diarrhea. 13 Though yogurt is known to contain bacteria, which improves intestinal health, it can still be very hard on the stomach. Soy contains nutritionally valuable carbohydrates called ""fructooligosaccharides"" (FOS), which nourish the helpful intestinal bacteria without the irritation caused by lactose. 14 For these reasons soy is an ideal alternative to dairy.  For so many reasons soy is a great addition to every woman's diet. Soy can increase heart health, lower cancer risk, increase bone health, and alleviate countless menopausal symptoms. Soy protein contains less fat, no cholesterol and ten times as much fiber as animal protein. It is also much easier on your stomach making it a fantastic alternative to animal proteins and dairy products. All in all it seems soy is pure joy.

Body Fat: A Necessary Evil? What Is It And What Is Its Purpose?
Not sure why you are fat. Get some great facts right here! In this article I will discuss body fats composition and why it is needed, how it distributes itself, why some possess excessive levels and what can be done about it.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson235.htm,"One major enemy of the Western world does not come in human form. Rather, it is a substance, an energy component, that many spend their lives trying to rid themselves of. At once considered a health concern and a necessary health component, this substance, fat, which comes in various forms and compositions, is on the minds of many as they begin their day.  Much of big businesses commercial success hinges on fat removal for health and aesthetic reasons. New and innovative diets and training regimens designed for the express purpose of reducing its deposition are springing up almost daily, such is its reputation as a health concern and the implications it has for all who posses excessive levels.  With such an emphasis on fat reduction between much of the world's industrialized population and with all the coverage it receives in various media, there seems to be a surprising lack of insight as to exactly what it is and why we at turns need a certain amount, but not an oversupply.  While many know what body fat is in its more obvious problematic form, few have a detailed understanding of what its purpose really is. So why do we have body fat and exactly what is this, often-unsightly substance that, if maintained at an appropriate level, can be crucial for survival, health and wellbeing?  In this article I will discuss body fats composition and why it is needed, how it distributes itself, why some possess excessive levels and what can be done about it.  Body Fat What Is Body Fat, What Are Its Problems & Why Do We Need It?   What Is Body Fat?  Stored body fat in its most easily recognisable lumpy form - the type that contributes to obesity if accumulated in significant quantities - is made up of free fatty acids liberated from various lipoproteins (a lipoprotein is a chemical compound made of protein and fat, that transports lipids around the body to perform various biological functions).   RELATED ARTICLE  Body Fat - What Is It?   Fat is a tissue that is needed by the body for a wide variety of functions such as temperature regulation, shock absorption, etc. Learn here what body fat is, how much we actually have, and much more. [ Click here to learn more. ]  Once liberated, these fats if not used as energy, will be stored in adipocytes (commonly referred to as fat cells), which form the composition of adipose tissue. From there they are assembled into triglycerides to be stored for future use. When we refer to body fat we are talking about adipose tissue and its lipid containing adipocytes.  Adipose tissue is primarily situated beneath the skin, where its main role is to store energy in the form of fat. Depending on its quantity and deposition, this stored fat can be good or bad.   What Are Its Problems? On the downside, fat cells have been shown to play a role in determining insulin resistance. A large accumulation of abdominal fat (or central obesity) is viewed as an important marker of diabetes as, due to its specific metabolic profile, and given it can prevent a normal insulin response, it is more prone to impaired glucose tolerance, a state that often leads to full-blown diabetes.  Diagnosed by measuring the hip to waist ratio, central obesity (which can be confirmed if the waist measurement exceeds 1.0 in men, or 0.9 in women) also contributes to the expression of Resistin, a hormone that is thought to suppress the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in fat cells, thus potentially linking obesity to diabetes.  In addition to its influence on insulin response, central obesity is also considered a major risk factor for high blood pressure and heart disease, making it something to be avoided at all costs.   RELATED ARTICLE  Give Yourself A Healthy Heart.   We all know that exercise is crucial for the heart. But let's not forget about some of the nutrients that we must include for optimum health. [ Click here to learn more. ]  In fact, topping the list of combined factors which may result in ""metabolic syndrome"", or an increased risk for both heart disease and diabetes (type 2), is waist circumference - for men a measurement of 40 inches or more, or for women 35 inches, will significantly increase their chances of getting metabolic syndrome.  Aromatase Production:  An additional concern for those who possess excessive fat is its potential to produce the enzyme aromatase. Adipose tissue is the greatest peripheral source of the aromatase in both males and females and it has been shown, in some cases, to advance breast cancer, although its principal function is to transform androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol, thus increasing estrogen levels.  Excessive estrogen can contribute to several health problems, including the aforementioned breast cancer (as in women who are estrogen-dominant it may cause rapid growth of cancer cells), risk of heart disease and stroke, baldness, obesity (which can cause a vicious weight-loss cycle) and reduced sexual appetite, not to mention the diminishing of testosterone, which has many beneficial functions such as fat reduction and muscle and bone growth.   View Anti-Estrogen Products Sorted By Top Sellers Here.   Why Do We Need It?  While it is obvious that surplus fat can contribute to a raft of health problems, several of which are mentioned above, at acceptable limits it can be advantageous. An acceptable level of fat (defined as between 18 and 24 percent for men and 25 to 31 percent for women, according to the American Council on Exercise) can promote favourable health conditions.  Hormone Production:  According to Zhaoping Li, M.D., director of clinical research at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, ""Fat cells are not as passive as physicians once thought. It has been widely accepted that fat tissue doesn't merely store fat but, rather, is an endocrine organ that secretes hormones to regulate appetite, insulin sensitivity and body weight1.""  Hormones leptin, which acts on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and burn fat stored in adipose tissue, TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor), which controls the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and helps cells heal or repair, and the prostaglandins (hormone-like substances), which regulate many of the body's functions, are examples of the beneficial molecules liberated from fat.  One who has an acceptable level of body fat will produce sufficient quantities of these hormones, whereas obese people, as mentioned, produce hormones that encourage the accumulation of body fat.  Triglyceride & Free Fatty Acid Levels:  Fat cells also play an important role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, the former being the chemical form in which most fats exist, the latter the components of triglycerides (fatty acids and glycerol) that are released into the blood to provide energy (these fats can yield relatively large quantities of ATP, the body's energy molecule).   RELATED ARTICLE ATP: Energy's Currency!   If one has ever wondered just how we are able to summons the energy to perform a number of activities under a variety of conditions, the answer, in large part, is ATP. Without ATP, ones body would simply fail to function. Learn why...  [ Click here to learn more. ]  Therefore, one who has a ready supply of triglycerides, not an excessive amount, will have an additional energy reserve. Fat as energy is often viewed as being one of the more efficient sources. As fat initially contains very little oxygen - it can combine with more oxygen to produce a longer lasting fuel source.  Additionally, and belying its ability to provide long-term energy, it is stored in the average person in comparatively smaller quantities. To illustrate its energy-giving benefits, an example of how it is stored can be used: given one-gram of glycogen - the body's primary fuel source - is stored with three grams of water, if it were to be stored in place of fat, which contains nine calories per gram in comparison to carbohydrates four grams, as fuel, a typical 155-pound male would have to weigh an additional 120 pounds.  Insulation:  As well as providing energy and promoting the release of important hormones, fat cells also have an ability to cushion and insulate the body, while fat ensures the absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K. Controlled levels of fat in the diet will help to the maintain levels necessary to effectively provide a thermal layer that will protect the body against cold conditions.  Fat in this capacity serves as a temperature control mechanism to insulate. It is also important to overall wellbeing in its role as a protector of vital organs. Regardless of how low we reduce our body fat, we all should maintain at least three percent, a percentage that will help to cushion vital organs, in particular the kidneys, heart and intestines.  This will help to hold these organs in place and protect them from injury. To illustrate the importance of this protective mechanism, the body will actually draw from these body fat stores last when its energy reserves are being tapped into.  Vitamin Absorption:  Fat is also needed to absorb certain vitamins that are crucial for health and wellbeing. A, D, E, and K, the fat-soluble vitamins, are so named as they are absorbed by, and stored in the fat cells to be used when needed. In fact this is one of the main benefits to having adequate fat in our diets. The recommended daily intake for fat is low (10-15 grams) so most people will achieve the desired amount through their diet.  Obesity Who Is Likely To Become Obese & Why?  Generally speaking and as discussed, body fat per se is not the problem; instead, its volume and distribution is what often leads to its reputation as a health concern. While some are genetically more susceptible to storing higher amounts of body fat, others seem to stay slim regardless of how many calories they shovel in.  The former group often have to fight hard to lose appreciable levels, the latter have no problem with regards to fat related conditions - rather they may actually need to increase its intake to obtain necessary levels. Those with unfavourable genetics usually gain fat more readily because one or both or their parents are overweight.   RELATED ARTICLE  Obesity: The Worldwide Epidemic.   We can no longer single out Americans when identifying obesity. This article will talk about worldwide obesity, eating patterns, and youth obesity including what we can do. [ Click here to learn more. ]   Cultural Context:  In some cases, this obesity problem stems from a survival mechanism needed to sustain certain populations in their original cultural context. For example, the peoples of various Pacific Islands, due, in part, to the cold temperatures experienced travelling by canoe from island to island, developed, as an evolutionary survival mechanism, an additional fatty layer.  Obesity generally did not pose a problem for them. Today, descendants of these people do not brave the same conditions but still have the genetic predilection for fat storage. This inclination combined with modern technology, which often reduces energy output, while increasing overeating due to the abundance of foods available, often results in obesity in people with unfavourable genetics.  If only these people, on a wider scale, knew of this genetic limitation, they could change their eating habits and counter their inbuilt propensity for fat gain. Indeed, changing dietary habits is often touted as a key to controlling weight gain for any population. Compared to some island cultures and their genetic fat storage potential, however, other populations may become obese through different means.   Learned Behaviour:  The impact imparted behaviours can have on future weight gain cannot be understated. Often obese parents will feed their children the kinds of food they themselves ate growing up. Thus, these children, already having the genetics for rapid fat gain, will build more fat cells from an early age, which will contribute to obesity in later life (world reports suggest childhood obesity is on the rise globally).   RELATED ARTICLE  10 Tips For Parents Of Overweight Children!   Parents, it is up to us to make sure our kids are eating right and getting the proper nutrition they deserve. Ive put together 10 solid tips to help you do just that! Remember they learn by watching you. [ Click here to learn more. ]   Fat Cell Growth:  The reason some people gain body fat, whereas others do not is not always genetic in origin though. Like muscle cells, fat cells can also be increased, especially at a young age. Eating fatty foods will, over time, encourage the development of new fat cells. These cells will attract the aforementioned free fatty acids, which will swell them to a greater size, ultimately manifesting itself in obesity.  Although fat can always be lost from these cells, the cells themselves will always be there ready to grow larger with further excessive dietary fat intake.   Gender:  Women and men also experience body fat distribution in different ways. Women, who are genetically programmed to carry more weight for maternal reasons (hence their higher recommended percentage range), tend to accumulate it around their hips and buttocks, whereas men, who are typically leaner and more muscular, generally store it around the waist (the average man has 26 billion fat cells whereas the average women has 35 million).  While both sexes can become obese with excessive calorie consumption, women will, in general, find it harder to lose stubborn body fat. One basis for this, in addition to maternal reasons - maternal fat is essential for reproduction and maintained on the female body to prepare for pregnancy - is its necessary role in ovulation and the higher levels of testosterone men have: it is known that girls don't begin to menstruate until their bodies are composed of at least 17 percent body fat, and men, with their higher testosterone levels will burn greater levels of body fat, both during exercise and at rest due to this hormones ability to use fat for fuel.   RELATED ARTICLE  The Truth About Body Fat In Women!   In comparison to men, it is true women naturally are prone to carrying more fat. Get the facts here about what fat is, who has more, hormonal effects, and more. [ Click here to learn more. ]  So although, as we have seen, there are genetic, cultural, and social reasons for body fat storage, most of us will become obese, or on a lesser scale overweight, if we live our lives in such as way to promote fat storage.  How Does Body Fat Reduction Work?  Body fat reduction can be approached in several ways. One of the keys ways to ensure life-long low body fat levels is to prevent fat cells from growing excessively in the first instance. For most, this means maintaining a diet low in the wrong types of fat (saturated and trans fats) right from the outset. However in all practicality most of us will achieve a good supply of fat cells by adulthood, making the reduction of excessive fat storage all the more important.  The keys to reducing body fat are quite simple but the science behind them is complex. Two major ways to counter fat storage are aerobic training, which uses oxygen and fat as a main fuel source, and resistance training, which builds the necessary muscle needed to stimulate the metabolic rate to burn fat to faster degree.   RELATED ARTICLE  Fat Metabolism!   Dietary fat is not an enemy. In fact, when adequate amounts of good fats (unsaturated) are consumed, it can improve one's health and athletic performance.  [ Click here to learn more. ]   Aerobic Training:  During aerobic activity, where the body works continuously for an extended period at a lower intensity level, the body will effective liberate fat stores (technically free fatty acids) for energy. Given our bodies carry a comparative abundance of fat, as the most efficient energy source available, it will continue to draw from these stores provided one does not cross the anaerobic threshold. At this point carbohydrates will become the preferred source and direct fat burning will cease.   RELATED ARTICLE  Carbohydrate Metabolism!   Like all things, there is much debate about the amount of carbohydrates one needs. One's carbohydrate intake should be decided after taking many other factors into consideration...  [ Click here to learn more. ]   Resistance Training:  With resistance training the nature of the activity is anaerobic in nature, therefore it will not directly use fat as fuel. Rather it will opt for carbohydrate in the form of stored muscle glycogen. However, as an indirect fat burning tool, resistance training is unparalleled.  Given muscle is a metabolically active tissue - meaning it takes much energy to keep it functioning - it needs a significant amount of fuel in the form of fat to maintain it. Thus, the more muscle one has the greater their fat burning furnace will be and the more body fat they will lose.  Conclusion  Body fat is something that we all have to a greater or lesser extent and it's value as a health component is undeniable. However, excessive amounts have been shown to be problematic, fuelling the desire of many to rid their bodies of it.  From a bodybuilding point of view fat is the enemy as it obscures hard-won muscle, from a health standpoint it can cause a raft of problems including heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Conversely, and as this article has shown, fat serves a valid purpose, as part of the intricate design that comprises our physiology, to keep us functioning properly.  Understanding this vital nutrient and how it works to keep us healthy could be seen as a major step forward in health maintenance and disease prevention.  References:  UCLA Healthcare. (2004).

Q & A With Clayton South - May 2005!
Clearing up the confusion for bodybuilders. Below you will find answers to questions about training, supplementation, love handles, water retention, and wanting to get huge with a heart condition.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/south108.htm,"[ Q ] I'm in the Marines, and I've been working out for a year. I've tried countless supplements including NO2, creatine monohydrate, and Optimum's Pro Complex Protein. I am still taking the protein along with my daily vitamin right now, but I'm looking for something to help me bulk up and to get rid of the 'soft' look. I'm looking to not only bulk up, but also cut some fat while I'm at it.  I work out 6 days a week. In addition to suggestions on my supplements, if you could give me a few pointers on how to refine my workouts I would appreciate it.  Thanks!   A. The soft look that you want to eliminate can result from three things: subcutaneous water retention, body fat accumulation, or the failure to sufficiently stimulate fast-twitch muscle fibers.   1. Subcutaneous Water Retention     Excessive water retention can result from excessive carbohydrate consumption, high body fat stores, or insufficient water intake.   Insulin levels surge when you consume too many simple carbohydrates.    When this happens, growth hormone levels drop, testosterone levels drop, and the testosterone to estrogen ratio is tilted in favor of estrogen.  Water retention is symptomatic of high estrogen levels. When women menstruate they often complain of feeling ""bloated"", and this is because estrogen is elevated during ovulation, and water retention results.  Estrogen also encourages the accumulation of body fat.  Click Here For The Top Selling Estrogen Blockers. Testosterone is the dominant male hormone, and testosterone is one of the reasons why men have more muscle and less adipose tissue than women.  If you don't drink enough water, your body will hold on to whatever you do drink. What's more, you will impair your liver and kidney function, and this will have long-term consequences. This kind of damage can not be reversed.  2. Body Fat Accumulation     It is possible to cut fat and build muscle at the same time, but this occurs slowly.    Ask yourself: have you gained ten pounds in the past year? You probably answered yes. Now, how much of that gain was fat-free mass? Six pounds? You've done very well if you've gained six pounds of fat-free mass in the past year.  If you figure out how much of that six pounds of lean muscle mass gain is gained per day, the answer is: 0.0164 of one pound. We are talking about fractions of an ounce per day here. So, you can see how pointless it is to weigh yourself every day on the scale - any daily bodyweight fluctuations will result from water shifting.  This point underscores the fact that muscle gain is an extremely slow process - even assuming that you are eating and training correctly. To gain muscle you must eat clean, unprocessed foods, and train with intensity. You must also provide your body with plenty of rest and sleep.  The process is identical when losing body fat. It takes hard, intelligent, work to become lean. When I interviewed 2000 Ms. Olympia Valentina Chepiga and asked her how long it took for her to get really lean, do you know what she said?  From the beginning, when she started bodybuilding, it took her a total of THREE YEARS to get lean and hard. Body fat reduction, like muscle building, is a slow process.  Valentina Showing Off Her Arms During A Bodybuilding.com Photo Shoot. 3. Training...     As for your training, I think that you are training too much. When you get up at 5am and do your PT, and then workout six days a week, how can your body recover?    When I was in the ARMY I was in a similar situation. I had to cut back my schedule to three days per week, and focus on compound movements like deadlifts, flat bench press and squats. I did 10 minutes of cardio before and after each workout session to circulate blood throughout my body and warm-up my joints. I also kept each workout to a strict limit of 45 minutes.  Click To Enlarge.    Because I was doing my PT at 5 am every day, I didn't want to be lifting six days a week in addition to running 5 miles every morning before breakfast. What's more, I didn't want to be lifting six days a week when I was out in the mountains or the field late at night on exercise.    It's important to understand that you're not just training your muscles when you exercise - you're also training your central nervous system. And, CNS fatigue is the greatest threat to your health. If your central nervous system becomes impaired, you begin to get sick, and even your mental ability to perform seemingly simple tasks becomes severely limited.  Make sure that you are supplementing with a multivitamin, an immune system booster, and IsoFlex. Also, make sure that you exercise and recover correctly.  Also, cut back your training to three days per week, and focus on heavy lifts.  Make your schedule realistic. Working out is not like ammunition; more is NOT always better. Remember this, and find the balance that works for you. Other Factors...   Supplementation:     Supplementation is critical for getting results. So, I recommend taking a multivitamin that has high concentrations of antioxidants. Antioxidants support your immune system and speed recovery. If necessary, supplement also with immune boosting supplements like Echinacea and Siberian ginseng.     You make or break your results, and your muscle is made or lost immediately after lifting. So, supplement with a low-carb, fast acting whey protein isolate supplement post-workout. One quality product that has given my personal training clients good gains is IsoFlex, by Allmax Nutrition.  IsoFlex is a pure product that's made according to pharmaceutical standards - the highest known - and it contains 97% WPI. The quality whey protein isolate in isoflex is critical for your results, because it's important to take a clean and pure WPI product post-workout when your body needs fast acting protein that is quickly released AND quickly absorbed.  While cheaper WPC - whey protein concentrate - products are released quickly, the large size of the molecules will slow their absorption, thereby costing you results. To gain muscle, you need WPI at this critical time, and IsoFlex supplies this protein when it counts.  IsoFlex also has an N02 delivery system. N02 is important because it helps give your muscles more of the nutrients and vitamins they need to recover and grow. More nutrients mean more muscle, greater strength, less soreness and faster recovery. Over time, faster recovery can make a big difference in how big you get.  [ Q ] I'm confused about what supplements to take. Everyone that I ask at my gym gives me different answers and I don't want to waste my money on supplements that I don't need. Please tell me: what supplements do I NEED to take?   A. After nutrition, supplementation is the biggest area of confusion for bodybuilders. So, in order of importance, here are the supplements that you need to take as a bodybuilder.    Immune-System boosters  Multivitamin and mineral formulation  Glutamine (bonded or free)  Protein powder supplement  Immune-System Boosters     Immune-system boosters are necessary for athletes in all sports. Exercise is intense and stresses the body and the immune-system. You can take massive amounts of protein but it won't matter if you are too sick to train.     Immune-system boosting supplements include antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, but also include glutathione precursors, Echinacea, garlic and zinc. Green tea is rich in antioxidants, and also contains tannic acid and polyphenols. For this reason I drink three cups of green tea throughout the day. One immune-system boosting supplement that I use religiously is Immuno-Shield by Irwin Naturals; it's simply stellar.  View All Immune-System Boosters...  Glutamine     Glutamine is important because it helps maintain the free-amino acid pool and positive nitrogen balance. Nitrogen balance helps preserve muscle mass during and after workouts when your muscles need glucose for glycogen manufacture. Glutamine can be used for this, and a glutamine deficiency can initiate muscle wasting.      Nitrogen Balance: The Key To Muscle Growth.   Any bodybuilder would know the key to gaining muscle is protein consumption. But how do we know if we are getting enough protein? You can find out here along with information on proteins and amino acids. [ Click here to learn more. ]  Muscle tissue loss can result in immune system weakness and a loss of muscular functionality. These losses can result in injury which can further impede physical functioning.  Glutamine helps to prevent muscle loss, and whey protein helps to increase muscle mass, thereby offering increased protection to bone. Increased muscle mass and improved body composition will serve to increase metabolic efficiency, and this will further allow for improvements in immune function.  These supplement types form the basis of a solid supplementation program that will yield results. Anything above and beyond these supplements is optional and should be used only when you have first successfully incorporated these supplements into your bodybuilding lifestyle.  View All Top Selling Glutamine Products...  [ Q ] What exactly is 6-OXO? And, what is it used for?    A. 6-OXO, made by  ErgoPharm, (4-Androsten-3,6,17-trione) is classified as a steroid, even though it doesn't exert any direct effect on hormone profile.  Instead, 6-OXO, as an estrogen suicide inhibitor, binds permanently to the estrogen enzyme (because of its high affinity) and renders it inactive.  The inactive enzyme is then removed from the body. The result is lower estrogen levels and an increase in the levels of available testosterone.  Estrogen and testosterone are opposing hormones, and building muscle is possible only when you have high levels of free testosterone.  Muscle building aside, you also need high testosterone levels for immune system health and disease prevention. Low levels of testosterone can lead to sickness, lethargy, depression and a host of other problems, including muscle loss. Simply, testosterone is critical for quality of life, and 6-OXO can help to restore quality of life if your testosterone levels are in decline.  Click Here For The Top Selling Testosterone Boosters. 6-OXO is also effective for when you're trying to lose fat, or when you're trying to boost natural testosterone levels after a cycle of anabolic steroids. Testosterone is anabolic and lipolytic, and increases in your testosterone levels will cause you to lose fat and become more lean and muscular.  6-OXO is suitable for use by young and old people alike, but is not recommended for use by women.  [ Q ] I am an avid reader of your articles on Bodybuilding.com and elsewhere. I have a question about contest preparation. I am six weeks out from a contest and I still have these ridiculous love-handles; I've seen guys six weeks out who look ripped.  I weigh 130lbs at 10% BF - I want to reach 5%. I train with weights three times per week, and I do high-intensity cardio first thing in the morning four days per week. I consume about 1000 calories daily. I eat the same foods everyday (whey, eggs, chicken breast), and I cycle my macronutrients. I drink about 1-2 gallons of water per day.  Do you think I may suffer from water bloat?   A. It is possible that you will suffer from water retention.   The first thing I notice is how low your caloric intake is at six weeks out from the show. An energy intake this low (1000 calories daily) is usually reserved for the last five days prior to a competition.  Why are you consuming only 1000 calories with six weeks to go? How much further do you think you can reduce your calories and continue seeing reductions in body fat? Unfortunately, the answer is: you can't.    Effective Tactics For Physique Competition!   I'll cover each topic one by one, so by the end of this article you will be confident knowing that the package you display for your next competition will be your best! [ Click here to learn more. ]    It's important to remember that the function of stored body fat is to provide fuel for survival during times of prolonged famine. In your case, you are not eating enough calories - you're inducing a famine - and your body refuses to shed any fat. I suggest that you start eating more.   To test for water retention, I recommend depleting your glycogen stores. This will not only show you your true body fat percentage, but it will also shift your metabolism so that your main energy source is stored body fat instead of ingested carbohydrates.  If you are retaining water, insulin decreases resulting from glycogen depletion will result in water loss - a shedding of any water you are holding. You can then measure your body fat stores with precision.  [ Q ] I'm 20 years old and I've been training for one year. Here are my questions... Is there a way to be huge, as well as in top cardiovascular condition? I lift 4 times a week, as well as run upwards of 20 miles a week and I seem to be progressing in both areas fairly well. I supplement with creatine, protein, as well as ZMA, and I take a little Xenadrine for added energy.  I have a heart condition called cardiomyopathy and my doctors tell me that the most physical activity I should be doing is no more than a light jog a couple of times a week. I pretty much want to throw everything I have been told back into the faces of the people that have told me what I can and can't do.   A. Cardiomyopathy is a serious heart condition, and you should not only listen to your doctors, but discontinue the use of any stimulant products.   Stimulant products like Xenadrine state clearly that they are for use only by healthy adults. Do not mistake the seriousness of your potentially fatal condition - if you do, you're gambling your life.   What Is Cardiomyopathy? Cardiomyopathy is a serious disease in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed and doesn't work as well as it should. There may be multiple causes including viral infections.  Cardiomyopathy can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary cardiomyopathy can't be attributed to a specific cause, such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, artery diseases or congenital heart defects. Secondary cardiomyopathy is due to specific causes. It's often associated with diseases involving other organs as well as the heart.  The above notwithstanding, I congratulate you on your spirit and willingness to train hard and with enthusiasm. All that I think you need to do is shift your focus.  With a condition like yours, or with any health condition, the focus must be on becoming or staying well, and working within the realistic limits that you've been given.   The purpose of training is to improve the body and to enhance health - not to go all out, violate doctor's orders, and end up dead. The first step to shifting your focus toward health is to realize that it doesn't matter what other people think about you.  I'm continually surprised that people spend so much time focusing on what others think of them. The only thing that really matters is what you think of yourself. And, training is about the self.  It's about the body - making and keeping it healthy through an active lifestyle based on correct nutrition, correct exercise and correct supplementation. You will never accomplish anything if you're always focused on beating someone else, changing their views, or showing them how ""wrong"" their judgments about you are.  You have to be selfish with your training, you have to find your calling, and you have to make it all about you. Get a referral to a sports therapist or a conditioning specialist that can design an intelligent plan for your medical condition. Once you do that, find your purpose in the gym, and then go after it because it makes you a happier and healthier person.  There is a way to get ""huge"" and be in top cardiovascular condition: eat right, train right and be realistic. Getting into shape takes time. It takes hard work. If you're consistent, you'll get there naturally and safely.     Excerpt From 'Natural Bodybuilding': Training Method #2!

Research has found that women smokers can experience difficulties in getting pregnant. Women who smoke are putting their fertility at risk. Smoking also significantly increases the time it takes to conceive.   The greater the quantity of cigarettes smoked, the longer a woman is likely to take to achieve pregnancy. Smoking increases the chances of complications during pregnancy and labor. The risk of losing pregnancy increases with the number of cigarettes a woman smokes.  Smoking can harm the health of your child. Children born to maternal smokers are known to have weakened immune systems and be more susceptible to illness than children of non-smokers. Smoking can also seriously jeopardize men's fertility.  RELATED POLL Are You A Smoker?  Yes. Yes But I Want To Quit. No. I Used To Be But I Quit.     3.

Healthy Balanced Diet   Before and during the pregnancy it is so important to maintain healthy eating habits. A healthy diet will help to keep your hormone levels balanced and will provide your body with all the nutrition's it needs.   Try to start your healthy lifestyle sooner rather than later. Adopting a healthy diet is not about giving up all the food you like and enjoy; it is about taking responsibility for your own health and well being. Keep things simple. Changing your diet does not have to be complicated. By making small changes to your diet, you increase your chances of maintaining a healthy pregnancy.  What we eat effects our bodies and has an enormous impact on the functioning of our body's systems: from our circulatory system and nervous system to our digestion and reproductive organs. It can also affect our frame of mind.  I am encouraging you to eat lots of food rich in nutrients and essential food groups; all of which will contribute to your healthy pregnancy. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are crucial and play different roles in preparing the body for fertility and pregnancy. Carbohydrates are the body's basic fuel source. Click To Enlarge.Before And During Pregnancy It Is Important To Maintain Healthy Eating Habits.CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are vital for fertility. They help to maintain healthy hormone levels and balance sugar levels. Carbohydrates are divided into two categories: simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates.    Simple carbohydrates tend to produce a fast increase in insulin and blood sugar, but not much in the way of nutrients. Food sources include sugar, white breads, some snack foods made from refined white flour, and processed foods. In order to maintain a healthy blood sugar level, the amount of simple carbohydrates in diet should be kept to a minimum.  Complex carbohydrates are made of more complicated sugars and starches. They can help protect from high insulin levels and energy swings and can regulate bowel movements. Food sources include whole grain breads and cereals, brown rice, some vegetables, beans, certain fruits. They can help to maintain energy levels and provide you with some of the fiber your body needs. Click To Enlarge.Carbohydrates Maintain Healthy Hormone Levels And So Are Vital For Fertility.FatFat is a nutrient that, in the right form and right quantity, can balance hormone levels and support the circulatory system. Fats can be separated into two categories: saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats are found in meat, eggs, dairy products and some oils. The more saturated a fat, the harder it is for the body to digest, and this can lead to weight gain.    Unsaturated fats are found in nuts, seeds, grains, fish and olive oil. Good sources of essential fatty acids include oily fish, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds.  Protein Protein is an essential nutrition made up of amino acids. Protein is necessary for growing muscle and tissue and for making antibodies to help fight infections.

Overall, nutrition has a subtle but powerful effect on all of the body's systems including the reproductive system. Try to limit your intake of the following foods, wherever possible: salt, refined carbohydrates, caffeine, processed foods, fried foods, unpasteurized foods, alcohol, sugar, foods and drinks with added and sugary breakfast cereal, saturated fats, additives, preservatives.   3. Stress Reduction   Over time  stress can take its toll on the body and reproductive system. You may find it hard to sleep, lack energy, become irritable, suffer from digestive disorders and notice a decrease in sex drive.   The body is highly sensitive and will respond to stressful situations and periods of consistent stress in a number of ways. This may include interfering with the normal workings of the reproductive system - in both men and women.  In some cases a particularly stressful lifestyle that continues over a prolonged period of time may affect your fertility. The important thing here is to be aware of where the stress lies in your life and to take steps to minimize it. By recognizing where the stressful areas of your life are and taking small steps to alleviate them, you will start to feel more positive and in control and this will have a good effect on your health.  When we experience stress, our adrenal glands release the steroid hormone cortisol. If this is happening over a prolonged period of time, the excessive amount of cortisol in the body can upset the balance of other hormones.  In women, the hormone prolactin may be overproduced and interfere with normal ovulation, causing menstruation to become irregular. In men, research has shown that stress can lead to a drop in number of sperm with abnormalities. It is important that you do not let stress become just another aspect of your life. Identifying the cause of stress in your life is the first step in starting to overcome it. To minimize stress - relax. Relax - Relaxation can create a state of well being and improve your ability to cope.Breathe - The way you breathe reflects the amount of stress you are under. When you are feeling relaxed, your breathing will be calm. When you are feeling anxious or tense, you're breathing speeds up and become more irregular.Think Positively - Positive thoughts lead to positive results. We can often make stress worse by concentrating too much on the negative and allowing negative thoughts to overwhelm us. The idea of positive thinking is to challenge the negative thoughts that play over and over in your head.Massage - Is an excellent way of relieving stress and one of the oldest healing techniques.Sleep Well - Stress and anxiety are the most common causes of lack of sleep, which in turn becomes a main reason for stress. A good night sleep is essential for our mental and physical well being. This is why when we go without sleep for too long we become depressed, irritable, unfocused and more susceptible to illness.Click To Enlarge.Massage Is An Exellent Way To Relieve Stress.

Q & A With Clayton South - July 2008!
Clayton sorts out another list of questions relating to the tribulus, sesamin, man boobs, forskolin, and more. Read on!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/south_q_a_july08.htm,"Article Summary: Always speak with your doctor before taking any supplements. Muscular people have a testosterone dominated hormone profile. Exercise stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine.  [ Q ] I'm a college athlete and I am taking tribulus after having read about it in an article; it seems to be helping. I am concerned, though, that taking it may be against the NCAA banned drug policy. I am asking because while I can't find the name on the list of banned substances. It does boost testosterone, so I don't want to show positive on a drug test. What should I do?  Thank you.  [ A ] Before taking any dietary supplement it is always wise to talk with your doctor to make sure that you are healthy enough to take supplements. In your case, however, and especially because of NCAA regulations, you should check with your doctor and team officials prior to putting any supplement ingredient in your body.   There have been countless cases of athletes using dietary supplements that they thought were free of banned ingredients, only to find out that the product was contaminated with a banned substance, or that while the product was clean it worked so well as to produce a banned result - boosted testosterone levels - that could also be produced by a banned substance.  That being said, and provided that you are using a quality product from a quality company, I do not believe that you have anything to worry about. FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Tribulus?   With all the varying studies on Tribulus, I wanted to hear some real feedback from other members who have used it as a bodybuilding supplement.   Started By: fullarmor  Provided that you're using a high quality product from a reputable company, it is highly unlikely that your product will contain anything other than the ingredients listed on the label. If this product contains only tribulus as you say, then you will not show a positive result on any NCAA drug test.  The second reason that you have nothing to worry about is because of how tribulus works. While it is accurate to say that tribulus can boost testosterone, it is important to note that tribulus boosts testosterone by stimulating luteinizing hormone, through the stimulation of the pituitary gland in the brain.   Luteinizing Hormone Luteinizing hormone is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. In the female, an acute rise of LH - the LH surge - triggers ovulation. In the male it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone.   It is thought that this increase in luteinizing hormone increases free testosterone levels - meaning that it increases the amount of unbound and metabolically active testosterone that you naturally produce.   Doping tests of all kinds are designed to test for supraphysiological levels of testosterone - i.e. levels of testosterone so high that they could not have, under any circumstances, been produced naturally by your body and must have therefore been injected.  Testosterone Articles:  All About Testosterone! - By Virtual Muscle Increasing Testosterone Levels? - By Topic Of The Week The Big T. - By Planet Muscle Other Testosterone Articles...  Because tribulus does not increase your total testosterone count but instead increases only metabolically active testosterone levels, your total testosterone count will remain the same as far as drug testing is concerned. Therefore, no violation will be apparent on tests.  [ Q ] Can women use Sesamin? I am not a bodybuilder, but I just want to lose some fat. Will this product cause me to grow facial hair? Or, is there a better product for me? Something stimulant-free? Please help me; I'm trying to lose for my wedding/honeymoon.  [ A ] Yes, women can use Sesamin.   Sesamin is a natural fatty acid and fiber that's derived from sesame seed oil. Although there is some evidence to suggest that sesamin has a hormonal impact, and because of this it has become popular, it's important to understand the conditions under which sesamin may increase testosterone levels: primarily in circumstances of fatty acid deficiency or caloric restriction.  Because sesamin is a fatty acid, it is calorically dense, containing twice the amount of calories per gram as protein and carbohydrates. The fact that sesamin is high in calories is one of the reasons that it contributes to appetite suppression, but is also one of the reasons why it is a less-than-ideal weight loss agent. Sesamin does not affect facial hair growth in men or women.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Sesamin: Bye Bye Fatty!   In order to successfully lose fat, one must create a stimulus that tells the body to burn more fat and to stop storing/trying to store fat.   Author: Derek Charlebois   From your question, it is obvious to me that sesamin is not really appropriate for you and what you want to accomplish. Instead, and because you prefer to avoid stimulants, I'm going to suggest two things: diet and exercise.   When it comes to weight loss, the most important factor is nutrition. Fortunately, because simple weight loss is your goal, this is easily accomplished through nutritional means. Do the following:  Eliminate all simple sugars from your dietEliminate all junk food from your dietLimit sodium intake in your dietDrink at least 1 gallon of water dailyDon't drink diet soda as artificial sweeteners cause you to crave sugarIncrease fiber intakeIncrease protein intakeEat several times a dayEat your food from smaller platesEat less food As you can see, there is nothing complicated about these steps. They are very simple and, if followed, will produce very dramatic results very quickly for most people. Now, on to exercise.  Click Image To Enlarge.Nutrition Is The Most ImportantFactor When It Comes To Weight Loss.  The purpose of exercise with respect to weight loss is to increase your  metabolism and the amount of  calories that you burn. To do this, a combination of  cardiovascular exercise and resistance training is necessary. For simple weight loss that preserves muscle tissue, I recommend the following:   Do cardiovascular exercise five days per week, burning only between 300 and 350 calories per session, and keeping the cardiovascular exercise session between 35 and 45 minutes. Do resistance training three times per week, performing two exercises per body part, with two sets per exercise, with a per set repetition count of between 10 and 12 repetitions. Once again, the above recommendations are very simple and are easy to follow. The key to maximizing your metabolism is to combine cardiovascular exercise and resistance training, and to do both forms of these exercise consistently without too much of a break in between days in the gym. The other key to achieving success with this very easy to follow method is this: don't push yourself too hard.  I want to say a few things about this idea that you have to train as hard as possible and burn as many calories as possible every exercise session in the gym: you don't, and buying into this idea is a mistake that will lead only to overtraining and burnout. The fact is: if you push your body too hard, you will eventually become sick and burned out as your immune system will not be able to handle the stress. And, this may lead to weight gain, the opposite of what you want.  Overtraining Articles:  Overtrain If You Don't Want To Gain! - By Robert DiMaggio Overtraining: Signs & Solutions! - By Fawnia Dietrich High Frequency Training: Avoid Overtraining! - By Mike Mahler Other Overtraining Articles...  So, go slowly, and recognize that changes happen slowly, regardless of how hard you push yourself. Simply do enough to stimulate your body to change, and then leave the gym and rest.  If you do all of the above simple and easy to follow recommendations, I'm sure that you'll be very surprised at the results you get. Write me back and let me know of your success. [ Q ] Dear Clayton,  I have been working out for years and no matter what chest exercises I do, I still have man boobs. I can't get the fat to go away and the muscle to bulk up. I have tried lifting heavy weights, workout programs from fitness magazines. You name it and I've done it. Is there anything I can do to remedy this situation? Thanks.  Walid G. San Antonio, TX  [ A ] Thanks for the question. It's safe to say that if you have man boobs despite years of exercising, it is because your body fat levels are too high. Lowering them, then, should your first priority.   While it might seem that you could both add muscle and lose fat at the same time, the fact that you have man boobs tells me that your body fat levels are so high that it will be virtually impossible for you to build new muscle tissue until you have significantly lowered your overall body fat percentage. Why? Hormones.  Lean and muscular people have a hormone profile that is testosterone dominated, and for this reason these people can easily build muscle. Overweight people with higher-than-normal body fat percentages have a hormone profile that is estrogen dominated, characterized by chronically high insulin levels, and therefore can easily gain body fat while muscle growth is difficult. RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Training & Hormones!   Hormones are a busy bunch. From testosterone to cortisol there is a constant battle going on which should, at the very least, be understandable to the average person.   Author: Dave Draper  Therefore, because of these hormonal differences, two people with different body compositions can eat the same foods and react totally differently and with a different outcome.  Therefore, instead of trying to add muscle tissue by various workouts and methods, I recommend that you instead focus on losing body fat while maintaining your existing muscle mass. This is done primarily by the methods recommended above for the previous reader.  By eating well and exercising correctly, you will lose body fat while preserving muscle mass, and this in turn will make it easier to lose more body fat because your metabolism will stay elevated due to your metabolically active muscle mass. In this situation your testosterone-estrogen profile will also change in favour of testosterone, ultimately making long-term muscle growth easier. Click Image To Enlarge.Eating Well & Exercising CorrectlyWill Raise Your Metabolism. So, to conclude, by dropping body fat and maintaining muscle mass for the foreseeable future, you should be able to get your body fat levels down significantly and your hormone profile in favor of testosterone and muscle growth, after which time muscle growth will become a realistic possibility.  [ Q ] Hi. Can I take forskolin with Tenormin?  [ A ] I would highly recommend against taking forskolin if you are currently on the medicine Tenormin.   The prescription drug Tenormin is a beta-blocker that is prescribed by doctors to treat hypertension and other blood pressure problems. It powerfully affects your blood circulation and heart function.  Forskolin is a popular supplement because it raises cyclic AMP levels and powerfully burns fat, increases lean body mass and can even boost testosterone.1 Unfortunately, forskolin is also a vasodilator - it increases blood vessel diameter and increases circulation, and may therefore interact with Tenormin.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Forskolin & Testosterone.   I have been doing some research on forskolin. My question is does forskolin have any scientific backing that it actually helps to raise testosterone levels?   Started By: patriot1096   It is quite possible that from taking these two together, you may go from having hypertension - blood pressure that's too high - to having hypotension - blood pressure that's too low, which is equally, if not more, dangerous.   While I can understand that you probably want to use forskolin in place of other thermogenic agents, it's important that you do extensive research on these thermogenic ingredients when you're on medications for blood pressure. And always - ALWAYS - talk to your doctor BEFORE you take any supplement that may interfere with your medical treatment plan.  In my view, the non-stimulant route may be more appropriate for you, provided that the supplement you plan to use does not dramatically impact circulation and blood pressure - i.e. Arginine. Investigate further online and talk with your doctor to find out the best option for you. [ Q ] Hello Clayton, I am 16 years old. I have ADD/ADHD and I want to build some serious muscle. What can I do in the gym that will help me accomplish this? I don't want to take steroids - so what is the next best legal thing?  Thanks Ron.  [ A ] It's a good thing that you're not interested in steroids at your age, because you don't need them and they would do more harm than good. At your age, your  hormone profile is in rapid flux and, when it stabilizes at around 18-19, your  testosterone levels will be very high, making muscle growth easy - provided that you train and eat right.   Given your ADD/ADHD condition, finding the motivation to exercise will not be hard. ADD/ADHD is a neurologically based condition that is real and has been proven as real by neuroimaging science. The science shows clearly that, compared to non ADD/ADHD brains, people with ADD/ADHD have imbalances in the chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine.  Motivation Articles:  Maintaining A Balanced Focus With Motivation! - By Aaron Links Motivation: How To Achieve Your Goals. - By Fawnia Dietrich 10 Factors To Help You Stay Motivated. - By Shannon Clark Other Motivation Articles...  Exercise stimulates the release of both of these chemicals in exactly the same way as methylphenidate - also known as Ritalin - the most commonly prescribed drug treatment option for ADD/ADHD.  After years of research I am firmly convinced that the bodybuilding lifestyle is ideal for people with ADD/ADHD. Not only does exercise stimulate the same chemicals that are triggered by medicine, but exercise also prevents depression - a common occurrence in people with ADD/ADHD, especially those on stimulant medications.  What's more, bodybuilders eat frequently, thus ensuring constant and steady amino acid delivery to the body and even blood-glucose levels - both essential for people with ADD/ADHD to responds well to treatment.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Drugs In Bodybuilding!   To get an insider's look at this most contentious of issues, I recently spoke with a man who works with many top-level amateur bodybuilders.   Author: David Robson   Finally, bodybuilders use supplements like  multivitamins,  BCAA's and fatty acids, and research shows that people with ADD/ADHD are frequently deficient in minerals like  zinc, and in BCAA's and fatty acids and phospholipids. All of these ingredients play a role in optimizing brain function, and people with ADD/ADHD responds remarkably well - better than the average population - to using these supplements.   So, my advice to you is this: make sure your diet is spot-on, train as much as you need and no more, and get on a multivitamin, BCCA supplement, protein supplement and a fatty acid supplement. These are all legal and will get you great results at your age and with your condition. Good luck! Scientific References:  Michael P. Godard, Brad A. Johnson, Scott R.

Diet & Exercise Can Alter Metabolism.
Stay energized by improving your fitness level.  How diet and exercise can alter your metabolism.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pierce45.htm,"Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) can justifiably claim 60% to 75% of our Total Energy Expenditure (TEE). Simply put, TEE, is the total amount of energy that we expend throughout an entire day. Digestion and absorption of food is called the Thermogenic Effect of Feeding (TEF) and accounts for 5% to 10% of our TEE.  Energy expended via physical activity is called the Thermogenic Effect of Activity (TEA), which comprises roughly 20% to 30% of our TEE. Body Surface Area (BSA) is a major determinant of RMR, however, voluntary behaviors such as diet and exercise influence RMR in a positive manner.  Calorie restrictive diets can decrease RMR. I am sure that you have heard the story, someone diets in an extreme fashion and later regains their weight loss as they return to their normal eating patterns. Your metabolism is what you make it.  Scientific evidence notes that TEE is the most important value when attempting to manipulate energy balance. Let us probe further into the involuntary RMR, which has been and is currently utilized in countless research studies. RMR is measured resting following a 12-hour fast, which assists in controlling the impact that the TEF and TEA usually has on RMR.   Resting Metabolic Rate Calculator.  Bodybuilding.com has made your life a lot easier with these easy access fitness calculators. Calculate your rmr here.  [ Click here to learn more. ]   What is Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)?   What exactly is RMR? RMR represents all energy necessary to maintain respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. Specifically, it is thought that RMR is distributed as follows: (7%) kidney function, (10%) heart, (18%) skeletal muscle, (19%) brain function, (27%) liver function, and (19%) other vital processes.(1)  Figure 1. TEE = total kilocalories expended each day.   An estimated 60% to 75% = RMR, 20% to 30%= TEA,  & 5% to 10%= TEF(1).    Female AthleteAvg.

Compare three 30-year-old mesomorph females having identical height. The obese and average women have a low RMR per kg of body weight when compared to the athletic woman. Conversely this equates to the athletic female burns more calories per kg than does the other women.1  Interesting determinants of RMR include the phase of the female menstrual cycle and the release of thyroid hormones, which are categorized as catecholamines[Define]. The later events can actually increase RMR during times of fertilization.  Compellingly, when one restricts energy intake too severely a decrease in triiodothyronine (T3) and norepinephrine will lessen RMR. To a certain extent RMR is based solely from genetics, however RMR can be permanently altered. RMR will increase in reaction to extremes in the body's temperature.  Additionally, it is estimated that the luteal phase or fertile portion of the menstrual cycle can increase RMR by 5%. Ovulation occurs during the luteal phase when the female produces progesterone thus increasing body temperature.  The elevated temperature acts as an incubator for the maturing fertilized egg, granted conception has occurred. This increase in temperature involuntarily elevates the female's resting metabolism. Many factors of RMR are beyond our control, however voluntary behavioral changes such as diet and exercise, can influence RMR.1   Does Diet And Exercise Effect The Resting Metabolic Rate?   To answer the age old question does dieting decrease the RMR we look at a meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies focusing on diet and RMR were compared.  Thompson and coworkers have determined that RMR does indeed decrease to a significant degree when an individual is compliant with a diet regimen that is composed of less than 941 calories a day. For the record, the studies primarily targeted females between the 31 and 45 years old.  What about dieting with exercise? Will it make a bad situation worse? The same researchers conclude, if a healthy diet is prescribed by a qualified professional (in the US & Canada this is a Registered Dietitian) and the subject is well monitored, loss of FFM should be no more than 20% to 30% of the total weight loss. This amount is considered reasonable as researchers believe that the results of healthy weight loss is roughly 25% LBM and 75% adipose tissue (fat).  At first glance it seems as if exercise may allow an individual to maintain more LBM if they exercise while dieting.1   Don't Let Your Metabolism Fall.  These are the top ten ways you can boost your metabolism and keep it high - even through Fall.  [ Click here to learn more. ]  What about different types of exercise utilized during a period of caloric restriction, will this make a difference in RMR? In a 3-month study, 69 clinically obese females were assigned to 1 of 4 groups. There was a diet only ""control group"", diet and endurance exercise, diet and resistance training, and diet and endurance exercise plus resistance training group.  The subjects consumed a very low calorie liquid based diet containing 522 calories a day. Amazingly the changes in weight, body fat percentage, and LBM were not statistically different between all groups. However, a decline in RMR was noted and expected.  Due to the extremely low calorie diet an approximate decrease of 7% to 12% of RMR was observed in all groups. The effects of resistance training were measured utilizing a strength index calculated as the 1 repetition maximum (1 Rep Max).  Values for the bench press, latissimus pull-down, leg extension, and leg curl were studied. A 6% decrease in strength was noted in the diet only and in the diet plus endurance exercise group. Astonishingly a 10% strength increase was noted in the resistance-training group and a 3% increase was noted in the endurance plus resistance training group.  In these studies neither the endurance exercise group nor the resistance training exercise prevented the severe low calorie diet-induced decline in RMR and the individuals still had a significant increase in strength.1   The Impact Of Nutrition And Exercise On Both Sexes   This research thus far has targeted the female population, McCargar probed further to find results that were well rounded. This report focuses on the effects of nutrition and exercise and the impact that they have on body composition in both sexes.  The researchers Ballor and Poehlman examined 46 human studies in an effort to determine how training and gender influence body composition. All studies were at the minimum 4 weeks in duration. A diet restriction, and body composition determined by skin fold calipers or hydrostatic technique was conducted in each study.  The Metabolism Mystery Uncovered.  Learn how to change your metabolism to start burning fat all day long. In order to know what you must do to change it... [ Learn More ]  It is important to note that not all studies included an exercise program; therefore comparisons were differentiated between the diet groups and diet and exercise groups. Furthermore, differences were noted between the male and female subjects.  The fundamental findings revealed that the loss of LBM was significantly less in the diet and exercise group, additionally; this was consistent for both sexes. Approximately 72% of the weight loss was body fat and 28% of weight loss was from LBM in the males.  In female subjects 76% of weight loss was from body fat and 24% from LBM. The review of these studies revealed that the conservation of LBM was possible with modest resistance training done 3 times a week at a low to moderate intensity. That review crushed the common belief that it is harder for women than it is for men to lose weight. The females had an average of 4% more fat loss and a conservation of 4% more LBM than that of the male subjects.1   Does Increased Food Intake Increase RMR?   It takes energy to burn energy and there is scientific evidence that suggests an increased food intake increases RMR. This method has been exhibited in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa. Patients that participated in a professional nutritional replenishment program increased their RMR. If performed scientifically, increasing ones food intake can evolve a swell in RMR, a rise so colossal that it outweighs the possible increase in body mass.  It is widely known and accepted that exercise increases metabolism. To be precise the elevation in metabolism occurs during exercise and immediately following. A study, which revealed a statistically significant increase in RMR, was conducted. The subjects consisted of 18 individuals their ages averaged to 66 years old.  The study involved 10 males and 8 females who were embarking on a cycling regimen for 8 weeks. The subjects were going to cycle 3 days each week. During the first week subjects cycled at 60% of their maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) till 150 calories were combusted. In their eighth week, subjects cycled at 80% VO2 max till 300 calories were combusted.   Turbo Charge Your Metabolism With Extra Protein.  How many times have you started working out and then quit? In this article I will teach you...  [ Click here to learn more. ]  Their body weight did not change significantly; therefore it can be said that they did not gain or lose LBM or fat throughout the 8-week study. VO2 max increase was statistically significant. At the start of the program VO2 rose from 1.9 Liters of oxygen a minute (L/min) to 2.1 L/min.  When measured, cycling enhanced RMR by 11%. Pre-study the calories burned were 1.17 calories per minute versus the post-study results of 1.29 calories a minute. The noted increase in metabolism is not directly related to exercise alone, an energy flux had to have taken place.  Because the subjects did not experience weight change, an additional intake of food had to have been consumed in order to compensate for the extra energy expended in the study. This study reinforced what was found in the anorexic study, nutritional factors can change metabolism, in this instance the effect related to endurance exercise.  As depicted earlier, adequate nutritional intake appears to be vital in maintaining the energy producing processes of metabolism. For individuals attempting to lose weight, adequate intake complements exercise and restricted intake antagonizes exercise regimens.   Placing The Right Emphasis On Diet And Exercise   Maintaining an energy flux is important and it can be said that increasing LBM via resistance training should increase RMR. Although I advocate and firmly believe in diet and exercise in regards to weight loss, gaining LBM, and increasing RMR, people place unrealistic expectations on their regimens.  A researcher named Zelasko addressed this and stated that the way individuals perceive the role of exercise in weight loss and energy expenditure has become rather exaggerated through time. The major factor in losing fat is time, said Zelasko, and if TEE would be focused on, high intensity exercises would prevail.  Even though high intensity training uses a low percent of body fat, it disburses more fat energy as well as TEE. All this energy and fat utilization does not occur at that given time but rather in context of the entire day. TEE is critical in determining energy balance.  Most diet and exercise regimens will allow RMR to remain relatively fixed, however if a person increases their LBM they will burn more calories per kilogram of total bodyweight (Figure 2) thus enhancing their RMR. The TEF and TEA comprises the remaining energy expended factors, furthermore they are the most variable as well as the most likely to make a change.  Exercise regimens are of utmost importance, but emphasize on being consistent foremost, then utilize the acronym F.I.T., which stands for frequency, intensity, and time. Unplanned exercise and daily physical activity are also key factors when increasing RMR is the topic at hand.  Additionally, let us not forget my favorite phenomenon, the TEF; consuming tons of fibrous vegetables daily can increase your metabolism via the calories burned during digestion. Therefore it is the total amount of energy you expend in a day that should be considered if flourishing long-term weight reduction and maintenance is your ultimate goal.1   Conclusion   In culmination it can be said with statistical significance that diets restricting intake less than around 1000 calories a day should be avoided, as they can decrease RMR and furthermore antagonize the many benefits associated with exercise.  The suggested caloric intake falls within the REE and TEE, which represents a caloric restriction of 15%-20% for healthy and gradual weight reduction.  Exercise should be part of all weight reduction programs. Anaerobic activity done minimally 3 times a week at low to moderate intensity gradually increasing over time is suggested and adding resistance training will be advantageous allowing LBM and RMR to remain somewhat preserved.  TEE should be the main consideration in all strategies attempting to alter energy balance in a positive way. The TEF and TEA comprises up to 40% of TEE and they are the most variable and likely to make a change utilize them.  High intensity exercises have the greatest impact on TEE. If one increases these they have then shifted the normal curve positively in their favor and have made one of the most difficult things in the world become a reality.

My Journey Back To The Stage - Postpartum!
The journey back was much harder than I could have ever imagined.  I was prepared for the physical agony, but the emotional side... Read on to see how I made it back.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simone11.htm,"It took all of 1 year, 10 months and 10 days for me to return to the competitive stage. Although I had planned to return sooner, my priorities of being a mother first and a competitor second held me out longer than anticipated.The journey back was much harder than I could have ever imagined. I was prepared for the physical agony of getting my body back into shape, but the emotional aspect was a whole other ballgame. A Beautiful Baby Girl  July 17, 2003:My beautiful baby girl was born by an unexpected Cesarean section. I coached the OB the entire way through the surgery. I told him before the surgery that I needed the incision to be as low as possible so I could get back into my bikini, and then when he was stitching me up, I asked him to make my stitches pretty.  What Is A Cesarean Section? A caesarean section, or C-section, is a form of childbirth in which a surgical incision is made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies. It is usually performed when a vaginal delivery would lead to medical complications.  I bet he was glad when that surgery was over!! Although every time I've seen him since the surgery, he asks me how the scar looks and if I'm happy about it. I think he's proud of a job well done!! Post Delivery (162 lbs):Six weeks post surgery, I was cleared to start walking and at eight weeks Postpartum, I was given the green light to begin a normal exercise regimen. Although I tried to keep my diet clean and low carb, my pregnancy hormones only allowed for a minimal of cleanliness. 6 Months Postpartum (152 lbs):The first six months I spent nursing my newborn and although I wouldn't change a thing about giving my baby the best start possible, I had to make sacrifices in getting back to pre-pregnancy weight that I didn't anticipate. Nutrition: First of all, my body would not allow me to consume a low-carbohydrate diet and still produce enough milk for my growing baby. Each time I tried to cut back on carbohydrates my milk supply for the day decreased drastically, sometimes even to the point that I didn't have enough milk for some feedings and would have to supplement with formula, which didn't go over very well!I tried to keep to a clean diet and just eat whole wheat products, but my cravings got the best of me. I mostly craved hamburgers and pizza and anything that had anything to do with simple carbs. Come to find out I was still anemic from my pregnancy and from nursing, so once I got more iron pills, I felt much more energetic and the cravings weren't as strong.  What Is Anemia? Anemia, which literally means ""without blood,"" is a deficiency of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.  The three main causes of anemia include excessive blood loss (hemorrhage), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production.   Exercise: As far as exercising went, I continued to do cardio and plyometrics at my home and do resistance training with Avery as weight or my rubber bands. (See Working Out With Children Part 1 & Part 2). The gym was 30 minutes away and with nursing every couple of hours (from the time the baby starts to feed); I was unable to get to the gym in the evenings when my husband got home from work.  RECOMMENDED ARTICLE  Working Out With Children.   Getting back in shape after having a baby requires excellent time management! The more you can work child's play into your workout, the more time there is for everything else that needs to be taken care of during the day.

I was so excited to be able to get back into the gym and workout that I didn't know what to do with myself. My nutritional habits were getting back on track and I was feeling much better overall.Then I discovered some gold fish in Avery's baby carrier. I had peeked in on Avery a few times and had seen little girls playing with her, and realized that she was their little baby doll and they were trying to feed her. So being the protective parent that I am, I stopped going to the gym and opted to continue my at-home-workouts until she was big enough to hold her own in the nursery. One Year Postpartum (135 lbs):Luckily in the time being, a new gym opened within ten minutes of my home. I had envisioned myself competing again by this point in my post pregnancy life and frustration as well as depression; anxiety and a swarm of other emotions were beginning to take over my life.I had visited my doctor because I was feeling quite lethargic and couldn't figure out why. I thought that I might still be anemic as I had run out of iron pills, but all of the tests came back negative. Her suggestion to me would be a wake-up call. She said that I was probably depressed because my body was used to working out two to three times a day and eating a different way. Click Image To Enlarge.I Needed A Wake-Up Call.I knew that this was a possibility, but I wasn't willing to let it continue if that was the case. I had done everything in my power to give my baby the best start to life, protected her as best I could, spent every waking moment making sure she was reaching her developmental milestones through practice and repetition, but what I was neglecting was myself, and how could I give 100% of me to anyone if I wasn't 100% of me?I started going to the gym on a daily basis, and even got up to run in the mornings or did a second session at night after Avery went to bed. I did my detox diet that had previously worked for me. I tried three times before my hormones seemed to respond. I finally began to see results, both physically and emotionally. Click Image To Enlarge.I Finally Began To See Results. 17 Months Postpartum (128lbs):I decided to hire a personal trainer to take my training to the next level. I continued to lift four days a week and do plyometrics twice a week; however, now I had someone to push me through my plyometrics training sessions.I felt like I was part of an athletic team again and I was lovin' it! I also began lifting heavier now that I had a spotter. My strength increased drastically and I was able to do more pushups than ever before.  RELATED ARTICLE  How To Be The Best Spotter In The Gym!   There's more to spotting than simply pulling up on the bar or pushing up on the elbows. There is an art and science to effective spotting. Learn the best techniques here! [ Click here to learn more. ] What I did notice was lacking was my tumbling. Although I hadn't been a gymnast in 17 years, I never really lost my ability to tumble.Now that I've not tumbled at all in two years, my tumbling power has decreased tremendously. I'm guessing because my core strength is a lot weaker than it has ever been. 19 Months Postpartum (128lbs):Twelve weeks out from my first competition back I started to prepare my routine, costume and ordered a swimsuit. I was so excited about competing again, even though I was not 100% ready. Click Image To Enlarge.I Was So Excited!I set a goal for myself to have a routine prepared by the Pittsburgh show (May 28th), so no matter what I looked like, I was going. Since I was in competition mode, I decided to go to the Universe Show (June 24th) three weeks later as well.As I previously stated, my tumbling was not up to par and my core strength was lacking, so my routine was not as strong as it had been previous to my pregnancy. Although I love to dance, my dance choreography is almost non-existent, so needless to say, my entire routine was pieced together as well as possible for the Pittsburgh show.There were six competitors and I was just hoping to have the best show that I could. My mother, brother, husband, daughter and two friends from college came to watch me. It was wonderful to have such great support! What I noticed about myself prior to this competition was that it felt surreal and I wasn't going out there to win, I was just going out there to compete.I ended up falling on my back handspring back tuck combo in the beginning of the show, but finished up strong. When the bikini round came, I was actually trying to act like I had confidence. I knew that I didn't belong up on that stage. I wasn't ""feeling it"" at all.I guess I pulled some poise from somewhere because I placed 3rd in the bikini round and 4th in the fitness round and 4th overall out of six competitors. I was proud of myself for sticking to my goal, but at the same time I was disappointed in myself for not being 100% prepared. Click Image To Enlarge.I Pulled Some Poise From Somewhere.What made it all worth it to me was seeing my 22 month old out in the crowd cheering for me, and waving and blowing kisses to me. And when I finally got to see her, she said, ""yeah, mommy"" and clapped. 23 Months Postpartum (126 lbs):I really liked my Wiz theme and the music was awesome, so before the Universe show, I enlisted in the help of a friend of mine that does dance choreography. Most of my routine was changed and there were stunts that I could not perform at 100%, but the challenge of working hard to learn the routine was fun for me. Click Image To Enlarge.The Challenge Was Fun For Me.Again I went into the Universe competition disappointed that I was not at 100%; but proud that I had dedicated my life to my 23 month old, but still had the courage to take on the challenge of competing under unfavorable circumstances.I will have to say that this is the first time I've been away from my family since Avery was born, so that was difficult, but very much needed. So often we don't appreciate what we have until it's gone or we're away from the situation. I did have the support of my trainer and his girlfriend as well as my roommates, so that was nice.With that said, I was very nervous that I was going to forget my new routine. Then to top it off, we had to learn an opening number routine for the show. Man was I thrown for a loop as it was not listed in our schedule of events for the weekend. Yikes!!!Surprisingly enough, I nailed the opening number routine and I made it through my fitness routine. I'm assuming from repetition practice, because when I stepped off of the stage, I felt like a deer caught in headlights. After reviewing the routine on videotape, I really didn't think that it went as bad as I felt it had.However, my scores were quite low and one of the judges commented that I needed to stop thinking about what came next in the routine. Oops, I guess the ""deer caught in headlights"" expression did come across a bit. Nonetheless I was proud of myself for accomplishing a goal. Click Image To Enlarge.Oops! Conclusion Now I have to work hard to get to 100% competition shape and go out on stage with confidence and the attitude that I am going to win. There is nothing better than achieving a goal that you have worked so hard to achieve!

Thyroid - Ultimate Guide To Getting Lean
If you are having trouble losing body fat or you have hit that body weight plateau, then it is time to learn more about the ultimate factor – the thyroid.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drryan36.htm,"Whether you are the weekend athlete, soccer mom or a professional physique athlete your overall appearance is based on the same factor of a tiny little gland called the thyroid. This tiny little gland in your neck controls your hair, skin, eyes and every cell in the body.In your quest to become ultra lean or just shed a few pounds, your success is controlled by the tiny little organ. Several factors can go wrong and leave you bloated or just stuck on a treadmill confused about how you can drop those simple first four pounds. Making sure that your body is ready to get lean is one of the first steps of losing excess body fat.If you are having trouble losing body fat or you have hit that body weight plateau and cannot get your last few pounds off, then it is time to learn more about the ultimate factor controlling your bodyweight. Many other health conditions are closely associated with thyroid conditions.Thyroid problems often lead to hormonal problems, which can be very difficult to correct if left undetected. Several of our own habits can lead to a dysfunctional thyroid.The Basic ThyroidThe thyroid is a very small gland, shaped like a butterfly, it weighs less than 1 ounce and is usually located in the middle of the lower neck. The thyroid receives its information from the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. These are two glands located in the center of the brain. The pituitary gland stimulates the thyroid by producing a hormone called Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH.The thyroid produces two hormones that affect every single cell in the human body. Both of the thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), speed up your body's metabolism by affecting every cell at the cellular level.You're thyroid produces approximately 80% T4 and 20% T3. The affects of T3 on your body are very-very powerful and small amounts of the hormone have a powerful affect on your metabolism. Your body produces these hormones; the quality and quantity is monitored and controlled by the pituitary gland.The pituitary gland acts like a thermostat in your home and senses a high concentration of the T3 and/or T4 in your bloodstream. Once it senses a high-level of thyroid hormones, the pituitary produces very little TSH, if the blood levels are very low, then it produces larger amounts of TSH.The TSH stimulates the thyroid to absorb iodine and make T3 and T4. Various problems occur with the thyroid - Currently, the Centers for Disease Control indicate that approximately 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease. People of all ages, races and sexes can get thyroid disease - Women are approximately 8 times more likely than men to have thyroid problems.What Causes The Thyroid Disease?There are several different causes of thyroid disease. At birth, the thyroid is located at the rear of the tongue and it migrates down to the middle of the lower part of the throat as a person matures. In some cases the thyroid does not migrate properly, although rare the displacement of the gland leads to various metabolism dysfunctions. Currently, science is looking at the exact location of the thyroid gland how that might relate to various diseases.More common causes of thyroid disease world wide is the lack of iodine in the diet. Other causes are ultraviolet radiation, medications and trauma round off the top list. In this article you will find that anything that affects the pituitary, hypothalamus or adrenal glands will have an affect on the thyroid.The Following Conditions Cause HypothyroidismIodine deficiency is a problem affecting approximately 100 million people around the world. Iodine is used by the thyroid to produce thyroxin (T3 & T4). In the 1950s the US virtually wiped out iodine deficiencies by using iodine salt.A nonfunctioning thyroid gland affects one in 4000 newborns. The child is either mentally and/or physically retarded if the problem is not corrected.Postpartum thyroiditis occurs in approximately 8% of women after giving birth. In most cases it is a temporary condition.Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. This can lower or raise the amount of hormones produced.Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a painless disease of the immune system that is usually hereditary, but has been linked with carpet cleaning.Common hypothyroidism symptoms include:FatigueFrequent-heavy menstrual periodsForgetfulnessWeight gainDry course hair and skinHoarse voiceIntolerance to coldAnd othersThe Following Conditions Cause HyperthyroidismGraves' disease results in the entire thyroid gland being overactive and producing too much hormone. This problem is also called diffuse toxic goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) and is often associated with a condition known as ""BUG EYES.""Nodules are often associated with an over active thyroid. A single nodule is called toxic autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, while several nodules are called a toxic multi-nodule goiter.Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. This can raise the amount of hormones produced. More commonly associated with women after child birth, the painful or painless disorder results in hormones being stored in the thyroid gland and causes hyperthyroidism symptoms for up to several months.Excessive Iodine is found in many drugs such as some cough syrups (example: Amiodarone). The body often reacts by producing too much thyroxin to remove the excess iodine.Excessive long term use of stimulants (including thermal stimulants).Excessive long term high protein, low carb diets.Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:IrritabilityNervousnessMuscle weaknessTremorsInfrequent short duration of menstrual periodsWeight lossSleep disturbancesEnlarged thyroid glandVision problems or conjunctivitisHeat sensitivityAnd othersOther FactorsOther factors affect your thyroid and include:StressIllness/diseaseOutside/inside temperatureHumidityBarometric pressureExposure to Sunshine (Ultraviolet radiation)Emotions (Good and Bad)Sleep (Too much or not enough or improper sleep)Environmental factors (toxins mostly)Diet and eating habitsDrugsAgeSex-male or femaleGenderSurgeryDoctor TestingNow if you suspect a thyroid problem, many times your family physician is the best place to start. More complicated issues are handled by doctors of internal medicine or endocrine specialist. Thyroid problems are very difficult to diagnose and other conditions often mask themselves as a possible thyroid problem.Most often they will ask for a thyroid blood test that will include the thyroid stimulating hormone test or TSHT. This test often can identify several thyroid disorders before you even get any of the above symptoms.If you can get one, you should always ask for a thyroid blood test, even if you don't have any symptoms, since this allows for some base information to go off of later in life.The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has reported that the screening for even mild thyroid dysfunction in men over 35 and women of all ages is cost-effective for the more common test such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Remember that fact if the insurance company refuses to pay for the testing.There are newer updated levels of thyroid TSH. Please ask your physician to update your test even if you were told you were normal in the past 6 months.New Light On The SubjectMuch of the problems associated with thyroid conditions-treatment-research are the same problems that follow many other diseases. We are treating people based upon the ""Old School"" of thinking.Unfortunately previous statistics and research have been based upon poorly worded protocols. If you do research on patients who have not been properly diagnosed, then publish the results, the information is screwed up and passed on to the next research trial.For example, not until 2003 did the North American spine society offer measurable definitions as to the distinction between disc bulges and disc herniations. Sounds silly, but the research for back pain has suffered tremendously due to improper use of terms and clinical trials have obvious suffered.Similarly, thyroid problems are often ill-defined and not well understood. Treatments are often skewed by improper terminology utilized by the medical professions.More and more articles are surfacing relative to these types of poor protocol. Dr. John C. Lowe, editor in chief of Thyroid Science has distinguished many of these points in the recently published article, ""How the False Beliefs in Conventional Clinic Thyroidology Came About."" Thyroid Science 1(12):E1, 2006Another hormone that needs testing is the Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). This hormone carries the thyroid hormone around in your blood stream. If you don't have enough TBG, then your thyroxin has nothing to carry it to the cells.Your levels of thyroid hormone will be second place and there will be very little benefit of testing for your levels of T3 and T4. If your levels of TBG are too high, then too much of the thyroid hormones are linked up and can't get to the cells.Other Major Hormonal FactorsLadies FirstThe female ovaries produce three different forms of estrogen and only one progesterone. That allows for the estrogen to become dominate very quickly. Thyroid hormones allow our cells to produce energy. Having high levels of estrogen causes the body to produce high levels of TBG. That estrogen dominance will quickly upset the balance of hormones. We will discuss that shortly.Many drugs are artificial and often lead to severe side effects. Bio-identical drugs are best to replace deficient hormonal production. This is the new phase of medication and pharmacological research that is present today. Making drugs, or using supplementation that is very similar to what your body naturally uses, allow for better absorption and less side effects.Cortisol For Men & WomenThe adrenal glands produce another important hormone called Cortisol. Without Cortisol, you will soon die from the slightest change in room temperature. Some of the effects of low cortisol levels are hypoglycemia, low blood sugar, but mostly fatigue. The effects of high cortisol hyperglycemia, elevated blood sugar, diabetes, excessive weight gain-primarily around the belly.Individuals with adrenal fatigue usually function reasonably well when life is stable but fall a part when stress is added. ""Roid Rage"" is often related to the adrenal fatigue, since the adrenal gland cannot balance the body's hormonal levels when artificial steroids are being used.The upset balance levels your system off and the control of changes is off. Pre Menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is another example of the poor effects of adrenal fatigue. These individuals are more likely to be vulnerable to infections and heal slower than those individuals with healthy adrenal glands.Other common side effects include headaches, joint or muscle pain, heart palpitations and other allergy type symptoms. Individuals with allergies should follow up with an endocrinologist for testing before they are doomed to living on allergy medications their whole lives.Adrenal gets its' Latin roots from ""ad"" meaning-near; ""renal"" meaning kidney. The glands sit on top of the kidneys and have an internal area called the medulla and the outer called the cortex. The inner medulla responds quickly to stress and produces epinephrine also called adrenaline.The outer cortex produces cortisol to handle long term stress. This allow for a quick response and a slower time released response to help us better cope with our changing environments.Cortisol primarily produces gluconeogenesis, which is the conversion of fats and proteins to sugar. In addition the presence of cortisol helps adrenaline elevate your body's heart rate. Cortisol is a corticosteroid, but unlike the other steroids in that same family, it is quite safe when prescribed at higher levels.Commonly prescribed for individuals who have Addison's disease, a relatively rare condition in which the adrenal gland is unable to produce enough cortisol.Symptoms & Signs Of Adrenal FatigueShort-Term SymptomsDizziness or light headedness upon standingMuscle and/or joint painIrregular menstrual cyclesInfertilityHeadachesLow libidoLong-Term SymptomsChronic fatigueLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)Low blood pressure (hypotension)Hair lossHeart palpitationsCold and heat intoleranceAnxiety or panic attacksDry skinObviously several of the symptoms some very similar to those of hypothyroidism. Both are clinically distinct conditions and blood work testing is conclusive to differentiate the two. Once again, high levels of estrogen or estrogen dominance can often times contribute to adrenal insufficiency.Another adrenal hormone is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The amount of DHEA produced by the adrenal cortex is greater than any of the other adrenal hormones, which includes androgens and the estrogens.Most individuals decrease their production of DHEA by the age of 30. Supplementation of DHEA is recommended past the age of 30 and also three to 6 mg of vitamin C per day to help boost immunity. Avoid caffeine, thermal stimulants, and alcohol; all of which stresses the adrenal glands.Adrenal insufficiency and/or adrenal fatigue affect about one out of four people in the US. It affects patients of all ages and both sexes. It will not present itself until 80 to 90% of the adrenal gland has been destroyed.In the United States about 70% of the primary adrenal insufficiency is due to auto immune processes. The rest of the 30% of the adrenal damages due to other causes such as:Tuberculosis (which is the most common world wide cause)Bacterial, viral and fungal infectionsAdrenal hemorrhageSpread of cancer to the adrenal glandsIt is rarely caused due to genetic abnormality of the adrenal glands.Lastly, the adrenal insufficiency can be caused due to a decrease in the production of the pituitary hormone known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is a pituitary messenger and it tells the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol. A pituitary tumor or other cause will result in the cortisol production being not stimulated. Long-term prednisone therapy will likely result in disruptions to the normal production of ACTH.You can quickly understand the complexity of the hormone system and how balance is the key element of control.Back To The ThyroidMost of the time, patients will obtain a thyroid test and be told that there are levels are within a normal range. As you can tell by the past few pages, testing a thyroid involves several factors and requires an expert to put together all of the results for proper interpretation.Testing the thyroid requires a T3 and T4 free and fixed. Testing should also require a TBG, cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, DHEA (when applicable) and other general factors to rule out other systemic diseases/conditions.You should realize that the standard ranges have been recently recalculated and new ranges have been published since Jan. 2007. You should also take note that several physicians may not be using the proper protocol and/or terminology.Thyroid conditions are extremely difficult to diagnose and treat. Importance has been shown in using bio-identical medications instead of artificially syndicated and synthesized drugs that have significant side effects.This table will help you to understand how doctors use blood test to rule in and rule out various conditions based on blood test.DiseaseCortisolACTHCushing disease (pituitary tumor making ACTH)HighHighAdrenal tumorHighLow""Ectopic"" ACTH (ACTH made by a tumor outside the pituitary, usually in the lung)LowHighAddison's disease (adrenal damage)LowHighHypopituitarismLowLowThis science is extremely complicated and physicians have to be on top of their game to be able to help you with these types of conditions. Just like with anything, some physicians are better than others at dealing with these types of problems.A through and intense case history and family history are the correct steps to beginning a successful hormone replacement therapy. Most of the time you should see a difference in the period of couple weeks.Make sure that she gave your physician lots of feedback and remember that they ""practice medicine."" Your results are not often as easy as a cookbook recipe. Trial and error will often result in a successful hormone situation."

HistorySince the dawn of time man has engaged in challenges of strength, dominance and competition. You can look at any period in human history and view this fact. From the samurai in Japan to the gladiators of the Roman Empire, to the jousting combatants in England, this had primarily been the sole domain of men and men alone, until most recent history.In our more civilized society humans generally prefer to use non-violent and means to compete; this is done through sports and games among other means. Bodybuilding continues this legacy in a non-violent manner in which men and now women can compete.Along with many any social changes that society has fought and won around the globe, is the right for women to engage in many activities in society that they had been barred from in the past, bodybuilding is one such activity.There was a time when being a female bodybuilder was unheard of and certainly taboo. Although, it is a sport still dominated by males, there are a number of world class female bodybuilders in the world today and a much higher number of recreational female bodybuilders than there was in the past.It is believed that the first legitimate bodybuilding competition for women took place in 1978 in Canton, Ohio. In 1980, the female bodybuilding competitions got their sanction. Named the National Physique Committee. 1980 was a breakthrough year as the Ms. Olympia was held for the first time.By comparison, the male's premier title, Mr. Olympia had its inaugural year in 1963. Though the development of bodybuilding as a sport is generally attributed to Eugene Sandow; as far back as the late 1800's. He started his bodybuilding paradigm with the ""strongman"" competition, later evolving his ideology to include development of muscle and posing in his shows.    Click To Enlarge.  2007 Olympia Winners: Jay Cutler & Iris Kyle.Differences What Are The Differences Between Male And Female Bodybuilding?The differences between male and female bodybuilding is evident at all levels of participation. It is important to make this distinction, as bodybuilding is enjoyed at all levels and encompasses the recreational, amateur and professional/competitive level bodybuilder. Certainly there are far more recreational bodybuilders than professional.At the competitive level, females are at a disadvantage in a direct comparison physiologically for the purposes of bodybuilding as it currently judges its competitors. Bodybuilding at the competitive level is judged by primarily by the competitors mass, definition, proportion, symmetry, stage presence and posing routine among other things.Females can compete through the same hard work to obtain all of the ingredients that a great bodybuilder is judged by except in the area of muscle mass. Testosterone levels and fat metabolism mechanism are the major difference in the physique differences.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Fat Metabolism!   Dietary fat is not an enemy. In fact, when adequate amounts of good fats (unsaturated) are consumed, it can improve one's health and athletic performance.   Author: Derek Beast CharleboisWomen do not have nearly the same amount of testosterone as males and this translates into the finished product that one sees onstage with far less mass. All things being equal, a female will have significantly less muscle mass than the male. Furthermore, the manner in which the female body metabolizes differs from the manner in which males do.Females generally have higher fat percentages than males, and they store it in different areas of the body, (hips and thighs, rather then the abdomen as males do). The body can more easily metabolize fat in the abdomen area then it can the thigh and hips.A further difference is that in many female bodybuilding competitions there are contests with titles that include words such as ""fitness"" in them. These contests seem to cater to the more accepted stereotype of the beauty and agility of the female body, rather than the muscular. These contests do not exist for male competitors.    Click To Enlarge.  2007 Fitness Olympia Competitors:Adela Garcia & Kimberly Klein.Other differences include a lower number of participants at all levels, though this is particularly true at the competitive level. Part of this has to do with the difference in available money for male bodybuilders versus their female counterparts. This extends to bodybuilding magazines and endorsements (how often have you seen a female bodybuilding on the cover of a mainstream bodybuilding magazine?).At the recreational level, in general, males engage in higher levels of bodybuilding supplement purchases, magazine purchases and bodybuilding equipment. Since the business is geared to males, it pays more to be a successful male bodybuilder, and in turn, males gravitate to the sport more than females.Diet, Training & Supplementation How Do Diet, Training And Supplementation Differ?Diet, training and supplementation do vary slightly between the two sexes; however, there are many similarities in these three components of bodybuilding as well and this must be explained in order to understand the differences. I will outline both in my response. Diet:High doses of protein are required to build muscle fibers after they are damaged by workouts. High calories are also needed to feed the muscles, maintain and/or grow, depending on ones bodybuilding goals. This is a universal truth regardless of gender.Muscle Fiber:Muscle Physiology - Oh Those Crazy Muscles! - By Eric BroserFiber Type Training. - By Dr. David RyanMuscle Fibers: How Do They Differ? - By Shannon ClarkOther Muscle Fiber Articles...What is different is the general requirements due to the size differences in competitors. A 260 pound professional male bodybuilder requires consumption of greater calories and protein than a 160 pound female bodybuilder to maintain and gain further muscle mass.Of course, this same concept applies to any two competitors of the same gender if there is a large discrepancy between weight; however, females in general compete at a much lower weight. Therefore the main difference between men and women exists in the quantities used.With women requiring more work than men in burning fat, many women use low carbohydrate diets and seek out foods that help increase metabolism to overcome some of the physiological disadvantages that females have.The diet for both men and women still requires the necessary calories and macro/micronutrients to achieve anabolic growth, and getting proper amount rest to grow, except, the body masses involved differ, although males do have a significant advantage in making progress due to testosterone advantages. Training:Training at the competitive level between the two sexes is more similar than different. The theories and practices that are required to develop muscle and/or decrease fat exist between both males and females.Both females and males need to increase their weight poundages, intensity and/or reps to break down muscle. This is because muscles in both sexes adapt to the work done in the past so a progressive workload is needed to force the body to grow and compensate for the increase in demands.Of course, due to males having a higher level of testosterone in the body, their bodies generally respond more dramatically to the increase in the workload, especially in the upper body where men enjoy an advantage in shoulder strength, though this same advantage does not exist proportionally in the lower body region.Testosterone:Increasing Testosterone Levels? - By Topic Of The WeekTestosterone Levels And Boosting Supplementation. - By Hugo RiveraAll About Testosterone! - By Virtual MuscleOther Testosterone Articles...   Click To Enlarge.  Male Bodybuilders Generally RespondMore Dramatically To An Increase In Workload.In regards to losing weight by training methods, both sexes follow the same approach. The theory of being calorie deficient suggests that one exerts, burns or puts out more energy (in calories) than one takes in. In contrast, having a calorie surplus; or taking in more calories than one burns, is needed to increase mass and size.This training approach goes hand in hand with ones diet as it will determine the amount of work done in the gym depending on one's goals. Women bodybuilders at the competitive level tend to include more cardio and high rep training to aid them in tightening up certain areas of the body, this is more easily achieved by their male counterparts who burn the excess fat more efficiently.Among recreational bodybuilders, there is a tendency for females to focus more on ""toning"" and shaping their bodies. This generally includes a lot more cardio with their bodybuilding to decrease their body fat composition.   Click To Enlarge.  Women Bodybuilders Generally Include A Lot More Cardio.Whereas male recreational bodybuilders tend to take an approach similar to professional bodybuilders in that they increase their weights and resistance but without the genetic advantages and dietary discipline that competitive bodybuilders enjoy and adhere to. Supplementation:Supplementation between both males and females differs depending on their bodybuilding goals. Women do tend to use more fat burning products due to their disadvantage in fat metabolizing, and along with diet, they adjust their requirements to meet their goals.Both men and women will gain the same benefits with increased protein, ATP replenishing effects in creatine, the same calories in mass gain formulas and such. There are numerous supplements marketed exclusively to females to try and overcome the physical differences, but these products are only marginally different.

View Creatine Products Sorted By Top Sellers Here.Steroids is a different issue to address, there are differences in the anabolic and androgenic effects on males versus females. In males, they generally suffer from a various degree of side effects as: breast development, shrinking of the testicles and many others. In females, the more common side effects include: enlargement of the clitoris, excessive growth of body hair and several others.Similarities What Are Some Of The Similarities Between Male And Female Bodybuilding?At the professional and competitive level, the similarities are astounding. All competitors are judged by the same standards in both gender competitions. As I have alluded to already, there exists the same requirements for bodybuilders of both genders to develop mass and ""cut-up"" in preparation for a contest.Of course, the exceptional dedication, demands and commitment to the development of the physique is required by both males and females and regardless of whether a bodybuilder is male or female; they handle and work through the same physical challenges.In the recreational bodybuilder, there is a desire by both men and female to increase their health and muscular attractiveness. This includes losing weight, muscle toning, increasing their cardio efficiency and using bodybuilding as a positive hobby and challenge. It is generally used an extension of a commitment to a healthier lifestyle and even to increase ones sexual attractiveness.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Look Great Naked!

Author: John BerardiThe Mainstream Male Bodybuilding Seems To Be More Mainstream Than Female Bodybuilding, Why Do You Think This Is?Male bodybuilding is more mainstream than female bodybuilding due to the double standard applied by society. Female bodies are viewed more appealing when they are curvy, somewhat soft and shapely. Men have more positively accepted and are viewed as appealing when they are muscular.A female is generally perceived as ""abnormal"" if she has the same muscular physique and hardness. Unfortunately, it is still viewed as going against society norms and ""unfeminine"" if a female bodybuilder has a great deal of muscle.Although much as the professional bodybuilding community accepts female bodybuilders, general society still views the female body through stereotypical models. For these reasons alone, many females who may want to become bodybuilders and who may in fact have the genetics and dedication to become great bodybuilders, shun away from even trying.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Can Pro Bodybuilding Go Mainstream?   Think back to when you were a kid and remember a few of the many sports that you enjoyed playing. Did any include bodybuilding? Probably not.  Author: Myron MielkeWith societies prejudices and opinions of what is ""normal,"" comes mainstream acceptance. Men go out to the gyms and buy the supplements and try to develop great strength and muscle size. In turn, businesses cater to the males in order to survive as an industry.Therefore, you will see in movies the muscular superhero; you will see on the cover of magazines the muscular male etc. It is not any different then the baking industry focusing on females as their main consumer. Society norms have dictated who is ""invited to the club"" and being a female bodybuilder is still viewed as being on the fringe of the community.    Click To Enlarge.  Is One More ""Normal"" Than The Other? Dayana Cadeau & Gina Aliotti.Finally, since bodybuilding is about size, mass and quality, and males have the obvious advantage, the common perception is that male bodybuilding is superior to female bodybuilding. Both require the same dedication and hard work, but due to the physical nature of the sport, females as a whole will never achieve what a male will.The same theory can be applied to most sports. The mainstream acceptance, although changing, still favors the male athletes and male sporting events. The number of male sporting leagues and attendance levels at the professional level far outweighs that of females.Therefore, where the money goes, business will follow, the visuals of muscular men will be far more evident than those of females and the perception that male bodybuilding as ""the big leagues"" will persist.Bibliography/References:www.bodybuilding.comwww.drugabuse.govwww.body-building-resource.comezinearticles.comhttp://sportsvl.com/rest/bodybuild.htmmuscle-pro.com 2nd Place - mawt View This Author's BodySpace Here. Bodybuilding was started as a solely male sport and the trend has not really changed even though female competitions have emerged. Female bodybuilding started in the 1970's and this did some justice to both genders.Women have never been known for strength and it has always been men who have been a symbol of power and muscularity which is the main reason female bodybuilding has not grown. Most argue that bodybuilding is less feminine and makes women lose their natural beauty.Early female physique contests were nothing more than bikini contests; the first U.S Women's National Physique Championship in Canton, Ohio is regarded as the first true female bodybuilding competition.Differences What Are The Differences Between Male And Female Bodybuilding? Natural Differences:While understanding the differences between male and female bodybuilding it is quite necessary to understand the difference in hormones that are naturally produced in the bodies of both males and females.The main differences being the natural production of testosterone in men while a very low production of the same hormone in the opposite gender. Testosterone being androgenic is the hormone that leads to natural muscle growth in men at puberty while estrogens in the female body lead to what we call a feminine body. So it is quite natural that women cannot naturally build a huge amount of muscle.The ratios of gains that come in naturally are at the ratio of about 1:10 with females not being able to gain anything close to what men can. With lower amounts of muscle and gains it becomes even harder to be a female bodybuilder. Competition:When coming to competition even the prize money differs with female bodybuilders being paid a lot lesser than their male counterparts which is discouraging and also means lesser appreciation for women in the sport. This is at times due to lesser sponsors for competitive female bodybuilding and at other times just because men are the ones who organize the shows.For example, at the 2005 Olympia, the men competed for a total prize fund of $550,000, while the women competed for only $71,000 (with an additional $55,000 available for the fitness contest, and $35,000 for the figure competition).So women have 2 extra fitness and figure competitions that are not held for men and are more popular at times. Figure competitions leading to fitness modeling, a career which has a lot of money involved.    Click To Enlarge.  2005 Olympia Competitors: Ronnie Coleman & Yaxeni Oriquen. Side Effects And The Use Of Steroids:Moreover when it comes to male bodybuilding affects such as hair loss, body hair and deepening of the voice even come naturally but when it comes to women these affects of steroids can cause serious problems. Women at times even lose their monthly cycle and get stretch marks on their skin so the sport becomes a bit more complex for them.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Menstrual Irregularities & Dietary Recommendations.   It's likely you've heard about women losing their menstrual cycle. Learn about women, menstrual irregularities and dietary recommendations.  Author: Shannon ClarkEven when it comes to natural (dope tested) competitions, women aren't able to do much as men with their natural hormones - men can build quite a lot of muscle while women, without the use of testosterone based steroids, are only able to build a very small amount of muscle.So men still can build a noticeable amount of muscle without the use of steroids while women cannot. These steroids also have to be restricted as they harm estrogens which are in a large amount in the female body and this leads to complications. Body Fat Levels:Women have an extra water retention and fat problem due to natural estrogens in the body and body fat levels are not as low as in male competitive bodybuilding and so it becomes more difficult for women to lose fat and come more muscular on stage.Women tend to gain fat a lot more quickly and it is a lot more difficult for them to lose this fat due to low testosterone levels. Though this fat is a real nuisance when it comes to bodybuilding it does help in child birth.Pregnancy:What Is The Best Workout For Pregnant Women? - By Workout Of The WeekMy Journey Back To The Stage - Postpartum! - By Simone SziksaiWeight Training & Pregnancy! - By David RobsonOther Pregnancy Articles...Diet, Training & Supplementation How Do Diet, Training And Supplementation Differ? Diet:Talking about diet, it almost remains the same. Female bodybuilders have to be even stricter because of their higher levels of fat and it is an equally strict and tough routine as for male bodybuilders.It is the same for female bodybuilders when it comes to calorie consumption and muscle growth and when close to competition it is the same kind of hardcore dieting with as minimal cheating as possible.The recommended intake is almost the same with 1-2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight to promote muscle growth and stay in an anabolic state. The same proportion also goes for the carbohydrate and fat intake but some female bodybuilders keep a lower fat intake depending on how they are able to control their body fat.// <![CDATA[function carbcalculate(){var bodymass2 = parseFloat(document.carb.bodymass2.value);	measurement2 = document.carb.measurement2.selectedIndex;	measurement2 = document.carb.measurement2.options[measurement2].value;			if (measurement2==2) {				kilo2 = (bodymass2 * 2.2);			} else {				kilo2 = bodymass2;			}var locarb = Math.round(kilo2 * 1);var hicarb = Math.round(kilo2 * 2);Get(""tcarb"").innerHTML =  locarb + ""-"" + hicarb + "" grams"";    }function reset2(){locarb = """";hicarb = """";Get(""tcarb"").innerHTML = locarb;document.carb.bodymass2.value="""";document.carb.measurement2.selectedIndex="""";}function Get( oName, oFrame, oDoc ) {	if( !oDoc ) { if( oFrame ) { oDoc = oFrame.document; } else { oDoc = window.document; } }	if( oDoc[oName] ) { return oDoc[oName]; } if( oDoc.all && oDoc.all[oName] ) { return oDoc.all[oName]; }	if( oDoc.getElementById && oDoc.getElementById(oName) ) { return oDoc.getElementById(oName); }	for( var x = 0; x < oDoc.forms.length; x++ ) { if( oDoc.forms[x][oName] ) { return oDoc.forms[x][oName]; } }	for( var x = 0; x < oDoc.anchors.length; x++ ) { if( oDoc.anchors[x].name == oName ) { return oDoc.anchors[x]; } }	for( var x = 0; document.layers && x < oDoc.layers.length; x++ ) {		var theOb = Get( oName, null, oDoc.layers[x].document ); if( theOb ) { return theOb; } }	if( !oFrame && window[oName] ) { return window[oName]; } if( oFrame && oFrame[oName] ) { return oFrame[oName]; }	for( var x = 0; oFrame && oFrame.frames && x < oFrame.frames.length; x++ ) {		var theOb = Get( oName, oFrame.frames[x], oFrame.frames[x].document ); if( theOb ) { return theOb; } }	return null;} // ]]>PROTEIN CALCULATORWeightSelect OnePoundsKilograms ResultsPROTEIN  Metabolism:Male and female bodies do not react in the same way to training and nutrition and the female body produces a lower amount of energy surge. Metabolism of the female body is a lot slower than the male body which means nutrients will not convert as fast into muscle.Metabolism:Energy Needs... What Are Your Calorie Requirements? - By BiologyBabeOvercome Your Slow Metabolism. - By David RobsonOther Metabolism Articles...The diet also needs to be a lot lower as women weigh a lot less than men. And with their weight being lower, women need less calories than men in the sport. Training:With a lower amount of muscle mass women in the sport are unable to lift as heavy as men and so their training is a little different from men. Women need more time in recovery and need more cardio in order to maintain their specific desirable fat levels. More rest is required as the metabolism is slower and so women are unable to be as frequent with their workouts. The monthly cycle is another hindrance to the training program and disrupts the process.Women have to workout with a lot of intensity to make up their inability to lift very heavy and this makes workouts almost as difficult as men.The main reason still being the hormones, with men having more testosterone, which helps in burning fat and building muscle while women having estrogen, does almost the opposite. So for women circuit training which can burn more calories is better and some extra cardio has to be incorporated in the routine to help in keeping the fat down.    Click To Enlarge.  Men Have More Testosterone, Which Helps Build Muscle, While Women Have Estrogen, Which Does Almost The Opposite.Again it is important to understand that women have a different hormonal composition and carry more fat and have a lower metabolism so training regimes should be constructed accordingly.Testosterone is what makes men aggressive so another drawback for women due to lower testosterone is the lack of aggression when it comes to workouts so this makes it a lot more difficult for female bodybuilders to keep their concentration on what they are doing.Women are naturally more flexible than men and so can perform some movements with much more ease than men without putting much pressure on the joints. Supplementation:The main difference is again hormonal. Natural testosterone boosters are not made for the female body and so are not taken by female athletes. Creatine requirements are lower and the same goes for protein shakes which makes the cost a little lower for women but they still have to and do train as hard as men.There are even separate vitamins and whey supplements for women such as Women's Whey and Optimum's Opti-Women, etc., and these are specially formulated according to the requirements of female bodybuilders. Female fat burners are even different at times as women carry more fat than men.    Click To Enlarge.

Competition Similarities:Almost all the poses with the exception of the most muscular pose are the same when both male and female bodybuilders step on stage.

Except for the cardio part which takes a larger proportion of the time that women workout; the rest is almost the same. Both use advanced methods like forced repetitions and supersets to increase workout intensity and stretching to maintain flexibility.The rest: the tanning process, the diet and preparation, and the off-season routine are almost the same for both genders and so there are not many differences in the approach of female bodybuilders towards the sport.The Mainstream Male Bodybuilding Seems To Be More Mainstream Than Female Bodybuilding, Why Do You Think This Is?Female bodybuilding has never been promoted the way its male counter part has been and has never even been funded in the same way for some amoral reason. Men have been known for their strength and aggressiveness and for their power to protect while women have always needed to be protected since ancient times and that is mainly due to strength differences given by nature and the way humans have evolved.Women have been known for their feminine characteristics of being delicate, weak and have been referred to beauty... and muscle is said to take away these characteristics - taking away a balance provided by nature. Moreover females are naturally unable to build almost any amount of muscle when compared to men and most argue that when their hormones do not support such growth then why should they force it.These thoughts are unconsciously in the minds of every individual who is related to the sport of competitive bodybuilding but not much is said about it. The lesser funds and prize give a clarion call that there is discrimination even in sports. Even after all the fuss about equal rights for women even sports haven't been free from discrimination.Plus female bodybuilding isn't very old; the first female bodybuilding competitions were not very ancient.Figure competitions are more appreciated as they do not take away the feminine characteristics of a woman and the competitors are later hired for photo shoots and contracts with magazines.To conclude it can be said that female bodybuilding, even though it is progressing, hasn't been as successful as its male version.

Another inspiring aspect of Bodybuilding.com's social network is when those same people make it a point to tell their stories and help others do the same. An exceptional person who exemplifies both of these characteristics is Christina Adler, otherwise known as redheadlaw7.  After struggling with a personal battle from postpartum psychosis, Christina found a much-needed release valve when she stumbled across the joys of fitness. With her daughter to thank as the initial motivator, Christina turned her newfound passion into more than just a hobby! As an NPC national athlete, Christina already has several shows under her belt and has long-term plans to make a push for her pro card - she has no plans of stopping until she achieves it!  Redheadlaw7 is living proof that if the mind can conceive the goal, then the body can make it possible. Check out the one-on-one interview where she reveals all. Don't miss this great opportunity to be inspired by the newest BodySpace Member of the Month. Tell us a little about yourself. My name is Christina Adler. I am a 38-year-old wife and mother to two daughters. I like to call myself a ""recovering attorney"". I gave up practicing law so I can continue to write fitness and nutrition articles and blog on my postpartum recovery site www.redheadlaw7.com.    She may not be practicing anymore, but redheadlaw7 still lays down the law in the gym.How long have you been visiting Bodybuilding.com and using BodySpace? I have been a member for a little more than two years now. What was it that led you to decide to start focusing on your health and fitness? After having my second child, I suffered from postpartum psychosis, which led to me being overweight, overmedicated and miserable. My oldest daughter begged me to go to mommy-daughter yoga class with her because she wanted her mommy to feel better. From that point on, I started making my health a big priority in my life. I started taking Pilates classes, and then I got addicted to Les Mills' BODYPUMP. Eventually I hired a personal trainer to help push myself a little further. Now I'm hooked. Do you compete, or do you stay so dedicated for other reasons? Yes I do compete. I have several local and NPC contests under my belt and I recently qualified to compete in the NPC on the national level in both masters and open figure. I have several contests scheduled for the fall and I plan to compete until I get my pro card. It may take a few years, but I'm not one to back away from a challenge. What is the most important thing you've learned since you started training? I think this is a tie between learning how important nutrition is to build a body and that lifting heavy weights is not going to make a female big and bulky. I would have started eating way more and I would have hired a trainer sooner if I knew what I know now. I can never emphasize enough how important it is that women work out with trainers or lifting partners that can push them harder and farther in the gym. You never know just how hard you can push yourself if you always fear getting trapped under a bar or dropping something. What is your favorite body part to train and why? I absolutely love training legs. I love setting PRs with legs and I love the days after when I can barely sit down or stand up. It's those days that I feel like I've really accomplished something.    Can you believe that redheadlaw7 loves training legs?What is the best fitness advice you could give to someone who is just starting? I think the best thing any person can do is find a good trainer and have them get you familiar with the gym, the equipment and your body. Yeah, it may be a little expensive, but so is wasted time. I know so many people who are willing to spend a ton of money on hair or clothing so they can look good, but think hiring a trainer is a luxury.  I think if you have a set plan that suits you best, you can spend way less time in the gym puttering around and spinning your wheels on exercises that aren't going to help you reach your full potential. Once you get yourself into shape you can worry less about dolling yourself up to look good. In the end, you've spent a little more money to look and feel fabulous in whatever you're wearing. How often do you treat yourself to a cheat food and what is your favorite? I am very embarrassed to say that I treat myself to cheat foods way too often. My biggest weakness is something I came up with while doing the Ketogenic diet. I would mix cream cheese, crunchy peanut butter and cocoa powder together and it tasted just like cheesecake. Now that I'm in the middle of contest prep I can't have any dairy so I treat myself to dark chocolate and peanut butter flavored almonds. They are to die for, but so hard to stop eating once I get started. Why do you think BodySpace would be beneficial to others? I don't think there is a better place to go to exchange ideas, tips, advice or inspiration having to do with nutrition or fitness. The site is packed with competitors, trainers, dietitians and beginners and everyone is so happy and willing to offer up their knowledge and support. And one of my favorite parts of BodySpace is being able to watch people's progress and view inspirational photos.  They always say a picture is worth a thousand words and when people see the truly inspirational profiles on your main page I don't think there's any better example. There's proof right there that it can be done. BodySpaceBodySpace is your key to bodybuilding, transformation, or fitness success. Create your profile, start a BodyBlog, meet others with similar goals, and share information. Join the largest    online fitness communityWhat are your future fitness goals? I plan on competing as long as my body holds up and I hope to continue to be an inspiration to others. Is there anything you would like to say to all the BodySpace people out there? I'd like to thank everyone for being so supportive, helpful and friendly. It really is an incredible place that I love visiting every day for my daily dose of motivation and inspiration.

Body Transformation: JoAnn Rivas Regained Her Physical And Mental Fortitude
In order to improve one's quality of life, JoAnn believes that one must change her emotional self as well as her physical self.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/body-transformation-joann-rivas-regained-her-fortitude.html,"Vital Stats     Name: JoAnn Rivas Email: fitnessjo89@gmail.com  Location: Williamsburg, VAWhy I decided to transformIn the summer of 2012, we took a family photo, and the sight of it made me burst into tears. I'd had a baby earlier that year, and was trying to get the weight off, but nothing seemed to be working.The body changes after having a baby, and I didn't know this ""new"" body I was in. I didn't like it either. That picture ignited a fire within me that has yet to burn out. I wanted to not just look great on the outside, but feel great on the inside as well.At first, my reasons to transform were for me and what I wanted. As I continued on my journey, I realized I was doing this for my family as well. I wanted to be a good influence for my son; to instill in him the ideals of a healthy and active lifestyle.I also wanted to encourage my other family members and close friends to invest in their own bodies, health, and future.How I accomplished my goalsI knew that I first had to get my diet under control. For the remainder of that year, I learned which foods did and did not work for my body. I ate five meals a day and only drank water or green tea. By doing just these things, I lost about 10 pounds.Before /// 175 lbsAfter /// 120 lbsAGE 23 / HEIGHT 5'0"" / BODY FAT 30%AGE 24 / HEIGHT 5'0"" / BODY FAT 18%Post To FitboardIn January 2013, I weighed 175 pounds, and I made it my New Year's resolution to really focus on fitness. I started running, and then began to incorporate yoga into my lifestyle as a fun challenge. By May 2013 I was down to 145 pounds, and began weightlifting with the guidance of Jamie Eason's 12-Week LiveFit Trainer. I've been hooked on weightlifting ever since. By July 2013 I was down to 130 pounds, all the while still eating very clean.There were definitely days when I wanted to just lie in bed, not go to the gym, and eat pizza and cookies all day. I overcame these obstacles through motivational audios and the encouragement of my other half. He had played college football for 5 years, so seeing him push his body to the limit and give his all to every workout filled me with so much inspiration. His drive and passion were contagious, and only forced me to dig deep and find my own.One weird trick I used was listening to audio compilations by Eric Thomas, Will Smith, and Ray Lewis every night. As soon as I woke up in the morning, I would hear their words freshly swirling around in my head, reminding me of my mission. I also stayed accountable and motivated by starting a blog. I tracked my workouts here, posted recipes, and shared progress pictures.The feedback I received from sharing my fitness journey was overwhelming and so positive that it only pushed me to get up the next morning and do it all again, one day at a time.Apply Here To Be A Transformation Of The Week!Bodybuilding.com honors people across all transformation categories for their hard work and dedication.

How To Get A Celeb Body That Will Burn Up The Red Carpet!
Women - Do celebs manage to get into such great shape in a short amount of time? Not really. They work at keeping their bodies buff year-round. Use the following proven tips and workout to get that sexy look so many of you are looking for!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/celebbody.htm,"How many of us haven't stood in line waiting to pay in a grocery store and at the same time glanced through one of many gossip magazines placed in the aisle next to the cashier. Reading about, and envying the pictures of the celebs looking amazing on the red carpet for the Oscar's, The Grammies and other events helps us escape our normal everyday life.  We'll see actresses such as ""Dreamgirls"" diva Beyonc Knowles, ""Volver"" star Penelope Cruz and Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon in designer dresses that show off shoulders and backs, legs and arms. Some may even go as far as peek-a-boo cut-outs that reveal sculpted six-pack abs.  But do celebs actually manage to get into such great shape in the short amount of time between the time nominations are announced and when the awards are presented?  No, not really. They work at keeping their bodies buff year-round, with some extra-special attention in the weeks leading up to these events.  I am sure many of us right then at that moment in the store or when reading the magazine at home are determined to reach that look. But unfortunately the dream stops when you drive past the doughnut store and stop to get your cravings satisfied, or when your kids call your cell phone and you have to skip gym to pick them up.  The biggest enemy for us women is excuses. And do you know what? Only we can make them up, and only we can prevent us from making them.  I have to take care of the kidsClean the houseDo grocery shoppingMake the laundryTake care of my husbandWatch the latest episode of some reality showWorkAnd more... and more Oh well at least the thought was good while it lasted.  Stop! No it doesn't have to end like this. You have to show yourself that you can change your mindset from weak to strong. Only YOU can make it happen.  Even if you have the best trainer out there, maybe Madonna's trainer or if you have all time in your life it won't matter as long as your mind is weak, because you will still give up even if you have everything served in front of you. You are in charge of your body and only you can set the limits of what you can do to reach your goals.  Click To Enlarge.You Are In Charge Of Your BodyAnd Only You Can Set The Limits! Keep the picture of the body you want in your head and then every time you feel weak for temptations or have excuses, bring it up. What do you want, the doughnut or a fit body? It's your choice. To fulfill and achieve something that makes you feel good will actually make you a better mother and wife too. It can make life much harder to love others if you can't love yourself. Never forget yourself!  I have been there too, trust me. I have been in the fitness industry for over 15 years. My career started when my son was a baby and I was a single mother. I was making the same excuses and trying to blame my surrounding for not being able to get the results I wanted. But after knocking my head in the wall several times I finally woke up and had a conversation with the inner me. Yes, this might sound crazy but it helped.

I always loved training and to be in control of my body, so I needed to follow through to feel satisfied and complete. To feel good about yourself will make you a better mom and person too. I put a picture in my head of what I wanted to look like and that was what I was working for.  I made up a plan to be able to schedule my training and diet into my busy schedule. I brought my baby to the gym and I took him in the stroller on my power walks. I tried to look at the positive sides more than the negative.

Author: Jennifer Nicole Lee  Now 15 years later I still prepare myself mentally and physically with a good plan for any upcoming challenges. If I keep my goal in my head then I know I will get there.  I have had the honor of walking the red carpet many of times and last year I had a great time walking the red carpet at an event in Hollywood with my friend Sherry Goggin. This was a great opportunity to get publicity and recognition and I knew I needed to look my best in front of all the photographers.  You have to be able to show off without feeling uncomfortable or shy. Because I had done my home work on my training, diet and supplementation I was now able to wear my short lovely dress and high heels and to shine like a movie star.  Well here is news for you! You can look sexy and shapely enough to hit the red carpet too!  Click To Enlarge.You Can Look Sexy & Shapely EnoughTo Hit The Red Carpet Too! I have been training Sherry Goggin and many clients to help them get in shape for events and I give them a consistent exercise program that fits into their lifestyle that they can do most days of the week. They have also been given a diet plan and supplement plan that will provide them with a perfect balance of nutrients that will boost their metabolism.  This will make them start burning fat while building and shaping their bodies. This gets them into a place where they are strong, fit and - or close to - their ideal bodyweight.  You can do it too. If you want arms like Madonna, legs like Cameron Diaz or a butt like Jenifer Lopez, then get ready to change your mindset and take action of your training and diet.  Start Your Preparation  To start your preparation you need the following:  Find a picture of a celebrity or person that you would like to have as your role model. Put the picture in your office or on your fridge. Somewhere where you easy can see it. Clean up your fridge from food that contains sugar and non essential fat. Throw it all in the trash can. We don't want any distractions or temptation that can play with your mind.

Time to fill up the fridge with healthy choices. Your main food should consist of brown rice, whole grains (whole grain bread, wholegrain pasta), chicken, turkey, lean meat, fish, vegetables (broccoli, green beans, asparagus and others leafy greens) and low fat dairy products.   Women need more calcium in their food so low fat dairy products such as cottage cheese or natural yogurt is a good source and can be very beneficial for your new Hollywood body.

For your cardio workouts, increase the intensity by going up in levels on the machines or adding some sprints or hills to your runs/walks so that you are burning more calories and really getting a good sweat. For the strength part of your workouts, focus on alternating workouts of heavier weights/fewer reps with lighter weights/more reps to challenge your muscles in different ways.

The day before the event, I recommend sticking with lean proteins and complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, and limiting fruit and veggies to avoid feeling bloated or gassy.

Recapture Your Form: 5 At-Home Post-Pregnancy Circuit Routines!
Not sure how to fit fitness into your schedule as a new mom? Try these quick, do-it-at-home workouts.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/recapture-your-form-5-post-pregnancy-circuits.html,"The arrival of your bundle of joy means saying goodbye to the giant orb your midsection grew to the last nine months. You also no longer have to worry about random people touching that giant orb as if it wasn't actually part of your body. Despite the incredible joys you might experience having your child, you might have some weight-related worries lingering around. Perhaps it is not surprising that studies show most women gain an average of about 30 pounds during pregnancy. Many of us end up gaining way more than that! There is good news! Within a month after giving birth, most women lose approximately 18-to-20 pounds. But what do we do when the body takes a ""pregnant pause"" shedding those extra ten pounds? Your body might be different after your pregnancy, but that doesn't mean it's incapable of losing that weight. You just need a little patience and consistent exercise, not to mention a healthy, clean diet to get back into shape.I get it though, trust me. Working out is the LAST thing you want to do when you're only getting a few hours of sleep and you feel exhausted. But even short, easy workouts can help you sustain energy through the day, restore your abdominal muscle tone, improve your mood, relieve stress and permit you to sleep better at night. Exercise is also helpful to control postpartum depression. According to a 2009 study, ""Home-based exercise is an effective and feasible intervention for alleviating symptoms of depressed mood in the postpartum."" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggests you can begin exercising when you feel ready, but you need to talk with your doctor before you begin a program. The ACOG also explains that if you've had a cesarean or difficult birth, it may take a bit longer to feel ready for exercise. The following circuit routines can be done in 15 minutes! They are safe, effective and can be incorporated into your busy schedule. What's the best part about them? You can do them at home!Each of these exercises can be tailored to fit your goals. If you are new to working out, try using lighter weight. If you are used to being active, use heavier weight or increase the intensity of the repetitions or sets.Do them every other day; you need to get a good day of rest between on-days.If you'd like to up the ante, try doing these circuits twice per day.To do these home workouts, you need a yoga mat, dumbbells, stability ball, bench or a chair. You can find these items in any sports store. Or, you can use things from home.Do all moves one after another; rest 10 seconds between each exercise. Repeat circuit three times. Add more activities to this routine like going for a stroll with your baby, walking in the mall, using stairs instead of elevator ore playing outside with your kids. Warm up and stretch before you begin training. After you are done, include some cool-down activities and stretching.

Bodybuilding Can Help You Beat Some Forms Of Depression.
Depression comes in many forms but all affect your life in one way or the other... There are several steps you can take to fight back against mild forms of depression.  Luckily, weightlifting is one of them. Find out more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bodybuilding_helps_depression.htm,"Article Summary: Depression is typically chronic and can drastically impair a person's life. Depression can be reliably diagnosed in primary care. Depression is common, affecting about 121 million people worldwide.  Bodybuilding Can Help You Beat Some Forms Of Depression   Depression comes in many forms but all affect your life in one way or the other, either temporarily or over a longer period of time. And, the current world events, war, aftermath of the mortgage crisis and stock market plunge are enough to make anyone melancholy. There are several steps you can take to fight back against mild forms of depression. Luckily, weightlifting is one of them.  What Is Depression?  Depression is a common mental disorder. Though the severity and symptoms of depression vary from person to person, they often include some or all of the following: persistent sad mood, irritability, loss of interest or pleasure in life events, poor concentration, sleep irregularities, low energy and low self worth.  Unlike a fleeting sad day, depression is typically chronic or recurrent and can drastically impair a person's life. Major bouts of depression can lead to suicide, which claims approximately 850,000 lives yearly.     Click To Enlarge.  Depression Is A Common Mental Disorder.  Unlike some diseases that affect certain groups of people more than others, depression can occur in anyone, at any age and from any background. Depression falls into several clinical diagnoses. Here are some common forms:   Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):     Seasonal Affective Disorder has symptoms that are seen with any major depressive episode. It is the recurrence of the symptoms during certain seasons that is the hallmark of this type of depression.   Like many people, you may develop cabin fever during the winter months. Or you may find yourself eating more or sleeping more when the temperature drops and darkness falls earlier. While those are common and normal reactions to the changing seasons, people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) experience a much more serious reaction when summer shifts to fall and on to winter.   Cabin Fever: Cabin fever is an idiomatic term for a claustrophobic reaction that takes place when a person or group is isolated and/or shut in, for an extended period. Symptoms include restlessness, irritability, forgetfulness, laughter, and excessive sleeping.    With seasonal affective disorder, fall's short days and long nights may trigger feelings of depression, lethargy, fatigue and other problems. Don't brush this off as simply a case of the ""winter blues"" that you have to tough out on your own.   Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression, and it can severely impair your daily life. That said, treatment - which may include light box therapy - can help you successfully manage seasonal affective disorder. You don't have to dread the dawning of each fall or winter.  Seasonal affective disorder is a cyclic, seasonal condition. This means that signs and symptoms usually come back and go away at the same times every year.  Click Image To Enlarge.People With Seasonal Affective Disorder Experience ASerious Reaction When Summer Shifts To Fall And On To Winter.  Usually, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the warmer, sunnier days of spring and summer. But some people have the opposite pattern, developing seasonal affective disorder with the onset of spring or summer. In either case, problems may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses.   Postpartum Depression:     Postpartum Depression is a type of depression that can occur in women who have recently given birth. It typically occurs in the first few months after delivery, but can happen within the first year after giving birth. The symptoms are those seen with any major depressive episode.   Often, postpartum depression interferes with the mother's ability to bond with her newborn. It is very important to seek help if you are experiencing postpartum depression. RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Inspiration To Help Defeat Depression!   Learn to be happy and then set goals. If you want to lose weight and be healthier than start your program immediately. Start NOW!   Author: John DeFendis   Postpartum depression is different from the ""Baby Blues"", which tend to occur the first few days after delivery and resolve spontaneously. The birth of a baby can trigger a jumble of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. But it can also result in something you might not expect - depression.   Many new moms experience the baby blues after childbirth. An estimated 10 percent of new moms experience a more severe form of emotional distress known as postpartum depression. Rarely, an extreme form of postpartum depression known as postpartum psychosis develops after childbirth.   Postpartum Psychosis: Postpartum psychosis or (also sometimes referred to as puerperal psychosis or postnatal psychosis), is a mental illness, which involves the rapid onset of psychotic symptoms in a woman following childbirth.   Although sometimes confused with postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis is a different disorder and is much less common. Postpartum psychosis is also known as ""postnatal stress disorder"", because the patient is under emotional stress and exhibits unusual behavioral patterns not seen before their pregnancy or postpartum event.    Postpartum depression isn't a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes postpartum depression is simply part of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms - and enjoy your baby.   Bipolar Disorder:     Bipolar disorder, another mood disorder, is different than major depressive disorder and has different treatments. For more information go to  bipolar.com.   SIGNS & SYMPTOMS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER Bipolar disorder is a condition in which people experience abnormally elevated (manic or hypomanic) and abnormally depressed states for short, or significant periods of time; in a way that interferes with functioning. Bipolar disorder has been estimated to affect more than 5 million Americans-about 3 out of every 100 adults.   It affects people without regard to age, race, ethnicity, gender, education or occupation. Not everyone's symptoms are the same and there is no blood test to confirm the disorder. Scientists believe that bipolar disorder may be caused when chemicals in the brain are out of balance.   Bipolar disorder can look like depression. Distinguishing the illness is tricky, even for mental health professionals. What makes bipolar disorder different is that in addition to depression, a person also experiences the ""highs"" of a manic phase.[ http://en.wikipedia.org ]  Symptoms Of Depression  Major depressive disorder, commonly referred to as ""depression,"" can severely disrupt your life, affecting your appetite, sleep, work, and relationships. The symptoms that help a doctor identify depression include:  Constant feelings of sadness, irritability, or tensionDecreased interest or pleasure in usual activities or hobbiesLoss of energy, feeling tired despite lack of activityA change in appetite, with significant weight loss or weight gainA change in sleeping patterns, such as difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or sleeping too muchRestlessness or feeling slowed downDecreased ability to make decisions or concentrateFeelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or guilt thoughts of suicide or deathDepression is common, affecting about 121 million people worldwideDepression is among the leading causes of disability worldwideDepression can be reliably diagnosed and treated in primary careFewer than 25% of those affected have access to effective treatments Depression can be reliably diagnosed in primary care. Antidepressant medications and brief, structured forms of psychotherapy are effective for 60-80% of those affected and can be delivered in primary care. However, fewer than 25% of those affected (in some countries fewer than 10%) receive such treatments.  Barriers to effective care include the lack of resources, lack of trained providers, and the social stigma associated with mental disorders including depression.     Click To Enlarge.  Depression Can Be Reliably Diagnosed In Primary Care.  Whatever its cause, depression is not just a state of mind. It is related to physical changes in the brain, and connected to an imbalance of a type of chemical that carries signals in your brain and nerves. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters.  Risk Factors  Oftentimes there isn't one single factor that causes depression but instead a combination of contributing causes. Although a serious life event such as death, chronic illness, financial problems or abuse can trigger a depressive episode or worsen existing depression, experts say that a combination of genetic, psychological and environmental factors are often involved. Some of these include:  Family History (especially in the case of bipolar disorder and major depression) Trauma and stress Pessimistic personality Stress Trauma Serious medical conditions Other psychological disorders Physical changes. After childbirth, a dramatic drop in estrogen and progesterone may contribute to postpartum depression. The hormones produced by your thyroid gland also may drop sharply - which can leave you feeling tired, sluggish and depressed. Changes in your blood volume, blood pressure, immune system and metabolism can lead to fatigue and mood swings.  Topic Of The Week:How To Combat Depression.  What can one do to combat depression? Depression is a common but serious issue that affects many people. Here are some thoughts & tips on the issue. [ Check Out The Topic Of The Week! ]  Emotional factors. When you're sleep deprived and overwhelmed, you may have trouble handling even minor problems. You may be anxious about your ability to care for a newborn. You may feel less attractive or struggle with your sense of identity. You may feel that you've lost control over your life. Any of these factors can contribute to postpartum depression. Lifestyle influences. Many lifestyle factors can lead to postpartum depression, including a demanding baby or older siblings, difficulty breast-feeding, exhaustion, financial problems, and lack of support from your partner or other loved ones. Trauma and stress. Things like financial problems, the breakup of a relationship, or the death of a loved one can bring on depression. You can become depressed after changes in your life, like starting a new job, graduating from school, or getting married. Pessimistic personality. People who have low self-esteem and a negative outlook are at higher risk of becoming depressed. These traits may actually be caused by low-level depression (called dysthymia). Physical conditions. Serious medical conditions like heart disease, cancer, and HIV can contribute to depression, partly because of the physical weakness and stress they bring on. Depression can make medical conditions worse, since it weakens the immune system and can make pain harder to bear. In some cases, depression can be caused by medications used to treat medical conditions.  RELATED WALLPAPERDepressed? Hit The Gym!

Body Transformation: Journey Junkie
Julia was convinced fitness models had elite genes before she walked in their shoes. See how this mother put herself first and started a fitness journey full of twists and turns!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/body-transformation-journey-junkie.html,"Name: Julia Valencia  Email:Valencia.julia@hotmail.comBodySpace:fitfoodjunkie      AGE 29 HEIGHT 5'1"" WEIGHT 174 lbs BODY FAT 34%  AGE 31 HEIGHT 5'1"" WEIGHT 110 lbs BODY FAT 9%  Why I Decided to TransformI've always been the person who tried to help and impress everyone before myself. As a result, I became completely out of shape, down, angry, and embarrassed about how I looked. I became an emotional eater to deal with issues and cope with stress. After having two beautiful children, I suffered from what I believe to be postpartum depression.Before I decided to make this life change, I was hanging onto an on-and-off seven-year relationship. I can look back on it today and realize it was going absolutely nowhere. As the years passed, we learned how to bring each other down more than we learned to love each other.I remember envying cover girls on fitness magazines while waiting in line at the checkout to purchase groceries. I was convinced they were part of some elite genetic community. One day, I decided enough was enough. Like a light switch, I decided to change my life and be healthy. I weighed a whopping 174 pounds and held 34 percent body fat. At 5-foot-1, I was considered obese. Up until that point, I was in denial about my health. That day was September 1, 2010. The beginning to any life-changing journey is never easy. The effort to get started and keep going during the first few weeks was difficult because I battled my own negativity. After a few months of hard work, people started noticing and my failing relationship ended once and for all. Putting myself first, exercising, and watching what I ate gave me time to reflect on areas that went wrong in my life. I discovered how to love myself. Within a year of this lifestyle change, I gained loads of confidence and learned to appreciate the little things.The decision to compete in figure came after eyeballing an event for nearly a year. I knew exactly which organization I wanted to participate in: International Drug-Free Athletics. I told close friends about my goal. Some were supportive and others weren't, but I forged ahead, lost friends, and gained new friends. The training and diet preparation was one of the most difficult yet rewarding journeys to date. Going through with it and reaching the end was an accomplishment I never fathomed I could reach. How I Accomplished My GoalsI embedded a ""no excuses"" mentality into my brain and it showed. I couldn't get to a gym, let alone afford a personal trainer, so I got creative. I started running up and down my staircase at home and performed simple exercises using my own bodyweight after my children went to bed. I watched what I ate and cut out sugary drinks. Within three months, after accomplishing a 3000-stair climb, I lost 21 pounds. I was pumped and continued stair-climbing and bodyweight exercises for two more months.By January 2011, I lost 32 pounds and started getting nervous about gaining the weight backit had happened before. Despite losing weight, I knew something was missing: clean eating and strength training. I was hesitant to pick up the weights and the thought of using protein powder freaked me out, but I put faith in the concept and off I went with nothing to lose. By May 2011, I lost 54 pounds.There were many days I felt like giving up, but I kept my ""no excuse"" attitude. I researched successful females like Tosca Reno, Erin Stern, and Kim Dolan Leto. I followed their stories, their past, and their training and eating habits. It became a daily regimen to spend at least one hour per day reading about successful women in the fitness industry. I searched the Internet like a fitness fiend, soaking up whatever information I could about clean eating and fitness. I watched inspirational YouTube videos about fitness, and overcoming obstacleswhatever I could get my hands related to fitness. Most important to me throughout the process were my children.

The Lowdown On EFA's!
Personally when I first heard that there were types of fats that actually helped your body and helped you lose weight, I did not believe it. After doing a pretty good amount of reading and some research, I found out that the myth was true.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/efa.htm,"Well I think some people, especially bodybuilders, are beginning to realize that not all fat is bad, especially essential fatty acids, yet approximately 80% of Americans lack sufficient amounts of EFA's in their daily diet [7]. Personally when I first heard that there were types of fats that actually helped your body and helped you lose weight, I did not believe it. After doing a pretty good amount of reading and some research, I found out that the myth was true. Here is a bit of what I found out through my research.  Fats In General   The main components of all fats are fatty acids, which consist of being either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids are generally solid at room temperature and are commonly known as saturated fats. They are usually derived from animal sources such as lard, suet, and butter. Most plant fats are high in either polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats except palm and coconut fat, which are highly saturated. Saturated and monounsaturated fats are not necessary in the diet as they can be made in the human body[2].  Essential Fatty Acids   Essential fatty acids (EFA) cannot be made by the body, thus must be supplied through the diet. They are essential for rebuilding and producing new cells.  Two basic categories of EFAs are Omega-3 and Omega-6. Omega-6 EFAs include linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids, which are found in raw nuts, seeds, legumes and sesame and soybean oil[3]. Omega-3 EFA's include alpha-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acid, which found in fresh deepwater fish, fish oil, certain vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oils[3].  These oils must be consumed in pure liquid or supplement form, which must kept away from heat, which destroys essential fatty acids[3]. These essential fatty acids are needed for the production of compounds known as eicosanoids, which help regulate blood-clotting, blood pressure, heart rate, immune response, and a wide variety of other biological processes[10]. Within the body both can be converted to other PUFAs such as arachidonic acid, or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)[3].  What Do They Do?   Transport oxygen from red blood cells to the tissues Promote brain development Keep saturated fats mobile in the blood stream Are an anti-inflammatory (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) Regulate pressure in the eye, joints, and blood vessels, and mediating immune response Regulate bodily secretions and their viscosity Dilate or constricting blood vessels Regulate collateral circulation Reduces blood pressure / Dilates blood vessels Regulate cell division rate Maintain the fluidity and rigidity of cellular membranes Regulate the inflow and outflow of substances to and from cells Direct endocrine hormones to their target cells Maintain proper kidney function and fluid balance Prevent blood cells from clumping together (blood clots that can be a cause of heart attack and stroke) Regulate smooth muscles and autonomic reflexes Regulate nerve transmission and communication Support cardiovascular health  Omega 3 Fatty Acids   Omega-3, also known as and written as n-3 or w-3, is the name given to a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The parent omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is described as essential as, similar to vitamins, because it must be obtained from diet. It is a polyunsaturated that has 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds[4].  Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role as structural membrane lipids, particularly in nerve tissue and the retina and are precursors to eicosanoids that are highly reactive substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes that act locally to influence a wide range of functions in cells and tissues[9]. It is also known as C18:3n3 (meaning 18 carbons, 3 double bonds, first double bond at the n-3 position)[5].     Omega-3 Synthesis  Alpha-linolenic acid ALA (18:3)    Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (20:5)    Docosahexaenoic acid DHA (22:6)   Both omega 3 and omega 6 cannot be inter-converted and both must be present in the diet in a proper balance for good health. The difference between omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids lie in their chemical structure and their roles in the body. Basically, the omega-3s have anti-inflammatory benefits and help prevent heart disease, whereas omega-6s lower blood cholesterol and support the skin. In one study, 8 weeks of omega-3 supplementation (9-10 grams per day) resulted in significant improvements in joint pain and stiffness among arthritis sufferers[8].  LA Deficiency [11]  Eczema-like skin eruptions Loss of hair Liver degeneration Behavioral disturbances Kidney degeneration Excessive sweating accompanied by thirst Drying up of glands Susceptibility to infections Failure of wound healing Sterility in males Miscarriage in females Arthritis-like conditions Heart and circulatory problems Growth retardation  Food Sources For Omega 3 Fatty Acids (Alpha-Linolenic Acid): Flaxseeds (linseeds) Mustard seeds Pumpkin seeds Soya bean Walnut oil Green leafy vegetables Grains  Oils Made From: Linseed (flaxseeds) Rapeseed (canola) Soya beans  Fish is not the only source of omega 3 acids. Flaxseed oil contains twice as much as is found in fish oil.  Omega 6 Fatty Acids   Omega 6 is linoleic acid, which is also known as n-6 or w-6. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds. Linoleic acid is considered an ""omega-6"" or ""n-6"" fatty acid because the first of its double bonds occurs at the sixth carbon from the omega end. It is also referred to as C18:2n6, which basically means it has 18 carbons, 2 double bonds, first double bond at n-6 position[4].  As polyunsaturated fatty acids, both the omega-6 and the omega-3 families have more than one double bond in the carbon chain. All fatty acids in the omega-6 family contain their first double bond between the 6th and 7th carbon atoms (CH3) terminal carbon atom and the omega-3 family of fatty acids have their first double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atom[5].  Deficiencies in EFAs can lead to reduced growth, a scaly rash called dermatitis, infertility, and lack of ability to fight infection and heal wounds. Lack of omega-6 fatty acids, however, is extremely rare in diets of those living in certain Western countries, particularly the United States. In fact, North American diets tend to have too much omega-6, particularly in relation to omega-3 fatty acids[6]. This imbalance contributes to long-term diseases such as heart disease, cancer, asthma, arthritis, and depression. For optimum health and disease prevention, the balance should consist of one to four times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids[6].  LNA Deficiency [11]  Growth retardation Weakness Impairment of vision and learning ability Motor incoordination Tingling sensations in arms and legs Behavioral changes  Symptoms That Respond Remarkably Well To LNA Supplementation: High triglycerides (fat) in the blood High blood pressure Sticky platelets Tissue inflammation Edema Dry skin Mental deterioration Low metabolic rate Some kinds of immune dysfunction  Good Sources For Omega 6 Fatty Acids (Linoleic Acid): Vegetables Fruits Nuts Grains Seeds  Oils Made From: Safflower Sunflower Corn Soya Evening primrose Pumpkin Wheat germ Why Supplement With Essential Fatty Acids?   If one does not to eat enough EFAs, there is a greater risk of hardening of the arteries, abnormal blood clot formation, coronary heart disease, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure[1]. Essential fatty acids are polyunsaturated fat and super polyunsaturated fat so your body utilizes them as building materials for cell membranes throughout the body. Without them, the body has to use other harder fats such as saturated fat, which produces harder arteries and many other heart problems. Essential fatty acids also produce prostaglandins, which are similar to hormone elements required for energy metabolism, cardiovascular and immune system health[7].  Research Findings    Many studies have been conducted to test the actual benefits of supplementing with essential fatty acids. A recent expert scientific advisory board at the National Institutes of Health highlighted the importance of a balanced intake of omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids in reducing the adverse effects of elevated arachidonic acid, which is a metabolic product of the catabolism of omega 6 fatty acids[8].  Recent studies have shown consumption of linolenic acid and other omega 3 fatty acids to offer protection against heart disease and heart attacks. This effect is thought to be mediated through the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oils contains large amounts of both EPA and DHA and the majority of studies in this area have used various concentrations of fish oil supplements to demonstrate the health benefits of these essential fatty acids. For example, one gram of menhaden oil (a common source) provides about 300 mg of these fatty acids.  EPA is known to induce an antithrombotic (clot-preventing) effect through its inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase, which results in the platelets sticking less to each other similar to the effects of a taking a pain reliever. Fish oil, and its high content of EPA and DHA, may also protect against heart disease through an anti-inflammatory effect by reduced cytokine production and/or increased nitric oxide production in the endothelium [8].  There is also some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil and flaxseed may help improve insulin sensitivity, modulate lipid metabolism, and combat both mild depression and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Although the data is far from clear, it is known that omega-3 fatty acids are concentrated in the brain and children and adults suffering from depression and/or ADHD typically show sub-optimal blood levels of essential fatty acids. In addition, population studies suggest that a high consumption of fish, which rich in omega-3s, may be related to a lower risk of depression, including postpartum depression[9].  How Much Should I Take?   A minimum of 4-5 grams of linoleic acid (but no more than 6-7 grams) and 2-3 grams of linolenic acid are recommended per day. Supplements of linoleic acid (n-6) are typically not needed, whereas linolenic acid (n-3) supplements (4-10g/d) and/or concentrated EPA/DHA supplements (400-1000mg/d) are recommended to support cardiovascular health.  Total DHA/EPA intake should approach about 1 gram per day - evenly split between the two. When using flax as a concentrated source of essential fatty acids, a typical dose is 1-2 tablespoons per day. If you bought a EFA supplement then just follow the instructions on the bottle [11].  Side Effects   No serious adverse side effects should be expected from regular consumption of essential fatty acid supplements, whether from fish oil or other common oil supplements. Due to the tendency of omega 3 fatty acids to reduce platelet aggregation, which means to make them less sticky, so your blood might not clot as fast as usual.  All around essential fatty acids are a good investment, especially to your health.  Get all your EFA Products here SORTED BY TOP SELLERS! References  Adams, P.B., et al.

Pregnancy And Exercise: Is It Safe?
Does remaining physically inactive actually protect the woman and the fetus? Is exercising safe?
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/teen/derek41.htm,"* This article is only meant to inform, not diagnose. The information presented does not replace talking with your doctor. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor about exercising and follow his recommendations.It was previously thought that when a woman becomes pregnant she should stay off her feet and avoid physical activity. This recommendation was instilled to protect the safety of the woman and the fetus. But, does remaining physically inactive actually protect the woman and the fetus? Current research says NO. Inactivity in fact has many negative effects. Negative Aspects of Pregnancy Pregnancy can negatively affect a woman in many ways. This includes: Nausea Fatigue Back pain Low self-esteem/Depression Gestational diabetes Excessive weight gain, which can lead to obesity Reduced energy Insomnia Constipation Shortness of breath SwellingThese negative effects can hurt the woman's health after giving birth as well. But one does not have to experience these pains because there is a way to alleviate and ease them through exercise. Positive Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy Because the choices a woman makes during pregnancy can affect her health for the rest of her life, it is important that she makes wise decisions during that time. Exercising during pregnancy, when adhering to the advice of their doctor, is one of the wisest decisions a woman can make. As mentioned, exercise alleviates many of the negative pains experienced during pregnancy. It has been shown that exercise reduces nausea, fatigue, and back pain while improving energy and self-esteem (Artal, 1999). Because exercise releases endorphins, a hormone which relieves pain, in the brain, it also enhances one's mood. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing concern. ""GDM is the most common complication of pregnancy, affecting about 5% of pregnant women."" (Brown, 2002) Several studies have shown that exercising during pregnancy improves glucose utilization due to increased insulin sensitivity, which normalizes blood sugar levels (Artal, 1999). Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is a dangerous trend. Most women never regain their pre-pregnancy weight. In fact, pregnancy can lead to obesity. Women gain an average of 2.2 pounds a year after giving birth (Pirisi, 2001). As shown in many studies, exercising during pregnancy can reduce excessive weight gain and decrease the risk of developing obesity (Bakoulis, 2001). Exercising can also increase a woman's strength. This will make carrying the baby, once it is born, as well as diaper bags and car seats easier (Bakoulis, 2001). Perhaps the most beneficial benefit of exercising during pregnancy is having an easier labor. By exercising, a woman can increase her strength, endurance, and overall ability to work with her condition, which makes the task of giving birth less strenuous (Artal, 1999). No doubt, every woman would appreciate this. What Type Of Exercise Should NOT Be Done? First, here is what a pregnant woman should avoid: Exercising in hot and/or humid conditions Dehydration Exercising in the supine position (The gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, a main artery, thereby reducing venous return... blood flow to the heart.) Contact sports (Football, boxing, wrestling, etc.) Activities that could result in falling (Running, skiing, mountain biking, etc.) High altitude exertion Scuba diving (Could cause air embolism)Also, the woman should not start an activity, such as running or jogging, if she is not experienced in it. What Type Of Exercise Should Be Done? The American Council of Sports Medicine recommends that everyone should exercise for at least 30 minutes on most, if not all days. This recommendation holds strong for pregnant women as well (Artal, 2003). Type of Exercise Aerobic exercise consisting of continuous, rhythmic movements that use large muscles is highly recommended. Examples of appropriate activities include, walking, cycling (stationary or machine), aerobic dance, rowing, and swimming. Swimming is considered one of the best exercises a pregnant woman can participate in because the water supports her body; therefore there is no impact on the joints. This is extremely important because during pregnancy, a woman's joints are looser because of hormone levels (Salmon, 1993). Weight lifting when done in moderation is also safe. Pregnancy is not a time to try to increase your one repetition maximum on certain lifts or set new personal records. Lifting light weights with moderate repetitions helps maintain flexibility, muscle tone, and minimizes the risk of injury (Artal, 1999). Duration and Intensity of Exercise Session For previously sedentary women, 20 to 30 minutes at a moderate pace is safe. Previously active women, with no medical complications, can continue exercising close to accustomed ways. As mentioned, pregnancy is not a time to up your intensity or strive to beat your personal bests. Research shows that for aerobic exercise, an intensity of 60-70% of ones maximum heart rate or 50-60% of ones maximal oxygen uptake is safe. Studies also show that exercising at 80% of ones maximum heart rate produced no adverse effects, but it is better to play it safe (Artal, 2003). *As with all exercise, remember to properly warm-up and cool down during each session.* Is Exercise Safe for the Fetus The main reason exercise during pregnancy was frowned upon in the past was fear of harming the unborn baby. There is concern that exercise challenges maternal thermoregulation (heat regulation) during pregnancy, but studies have found that humans have compensatory mechanisms that combat this (Brown, 2002). These mechanisms include increased minute ventilation and skin blood flow. These help dissipate heat during exercise. Studies have also found that there is no association between increased maternal temperature and risk of fetus malformation (Brown, 2002). Exercise has also been found to improve uterine blood flow and placental growth. This results in heavier, longer babies (Pirisi, 2001). Conclusion Exercising during pregnancy is safe IF, and I repeat IF, there are no medical complications. In some cases, exercise is not recommended. It is of extreme importance that you talk with your doctor before beginning an exercise program to make sure it is safe for both you and the fetus. Follow the recommendations giving to you by your doctor.

Sleep Yourself Slim: The Impact Of Sleep Loss On Hormones, Appetite, And Weight!
With only 6 hours of sleep, I convince myself to close my eyes, and think about anything relaxing that is not sleep. After 7.7 hours of sleep, I am really ready to start my day. But why all the fuss about sleep? Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sleep_slim.htm,"I hate sleep; I'm always eager to pop out of bed and start. Start anything: writing, making omelets, whatever. Though, sometimes, I wake up on a Saturday, get excited about wakefulness, and realize that it's only 5:30am.  I feel good enough to wake up and get going. But with only 6 hours of sleep, I convince myself to close my eyes, and think about anything relaxing that is not sleep. Then I usually wake up a couple of hours later. After 7.7 hours of sleep, I am really ready to start my day. But why all the fuss about sleep?  It's important!  First, there is conclusive research that constant, inadequate sleep puts you at risk of obesity and diabetes. Specifically, sleep loss messes with:  How your body uses glucose (sugar/carbs) and secretes insulinIncreases appetiteDecreases energy burned during a 24 hour period. 1. Don't Mess With Insulin   Insulin Resistance:  Insulin resistance is a problem that starts to rear its ugly head in the early stages of Type 2 diabetes. Despite the fact that the body (pancreas) is still making and releasing insulin, a person still cannot get rid of the sugar in their blood fast enough.   RELATED PODCAST  Diabetes Podcast.   Welcome to the Awesome Muscles Podcast Series, where you learn about the best training and nutrition scientific breakthroughs, and approaches, directly from your favorite fitness expert, Daniel Gastelu. [ Click here to learn more. ] Download Seminar #3! (16:53; mp3 - 15.4 MB; December 29, 2005)  This lingering sugar is very harmful to blood vessels, nerves, and eyes; it's also bad for the kidneys, since extra sugar is eliminated through the urine. As a result, your body has to make more and more insulin to get the glucose (sugar) out of your blood and into fat (usually) or muscle cells. Eventually, your pancreas says  ""Screw it, I work hard to clean up the blood and my insulin doesn't work anymore.""  In the advanced stages of diabetes, when your pancreas gives up, you have to start injecting insulin to use clean up carbs.  Listen up college students, shift-workers, and parents of small children, MANY studies show that a couple days of less than 4 hours of sleep per night causes insulin resistance1.  Related Insulin Articles:  Insulin & Supplements: What You Need To Know! - By Christopher MohrInsulin & Bodybuilding. - By ISSAManipulating Your Hormones. - By Intensity MagazineOther Insulin Articles... In essence, your body starts acting more like a diabetic's body, and your pancreas has to work too hard. As a result, many researchers think that chronic loss of sleep may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (which are both also linked to obesity and overweight).   What Is The Metabolic Syndrome? Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It affects a large number of people, and prevalence increases with age. Some studies estimate the prevalence in the USA to be up to 25% of the population.       [ wikipedia.org ]   Increased Desire To Eat High Carbohydrate Foods:  In conjunction with insulin resistance, sleep loss also induces cravings for high-carbohydrate foods 1,2. As such, the problem detailed above is made worse because the pancreas has to secrete even more insulin to take care the gummy bear binge.  Click To Enlarge.The Pancreas Has To Secrete EvenMore Insulin To Take Care Of Your Binging.  Increased Cortisol:  Sleep deprivation also increases the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with obesity, high blood sugar, and lowered immunity (disease-fighting ability). Furthermore, cortisol acts as a stimulus to BREAK DOWN MUSCLE, in order to raise the blood sugar.  The result of 2-3 restless nights is:  Greater intake of high-carb foodsIncreased cortisol levels, which results in muscle destructionA large spike in insulin to cope with excess blood sugar and insulin resistance. These hormonal imbalances, when you are feeling lethargic and shaky, can lead to significant weight gain.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  The Implications Of Cortisol Release!   Cortisol is termed catabolic as it has the opposite effect to testosterone, insulin and growth hormone in that it breaks down tissue.   Author: David Robson  2. I Can't Eat Enough  Cortisol and insulin aren't the only hormones affected by poor sleep. A number of hormones that directly influence appetite are also manipulated.   Lower Leptin:  Scientists used to think that fat was an inert place to store extra energy. Now researchers recognize fat tissue as a powerful hormone-releasing organ that influences diet and activity behaviors. Leptin is a hormone secreted from the fat tissue itself. The more fat you have (extra energy in your body) the more leptin is secreted, generally. Leptin is a hormone that tells your body:  ""You're too fat, stop eating and burn more energy (Calories).""  As a result, appetite diminishes and the body naturally burns more calories, mostly through non-exercise activities1,2.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Hungry, Hungry Hormones !   While you may not be hungry first thing in the morning, forcing yourself to eat or drink something is one of the most beneficial things you can do...   Author: John Berardi  But if a person doesn't get enough sleep, leptin levels decrease. Low leptin levels tell the body that energy levels are low. As a result, appetite increases!   Increased Ghrelin:  It is easy to think of ghrelin as a hormone that is exactly the opposite of leptin. Increased ghrelin tells your body:  ""You are not getting enough energy; eat more and move less!""  As a result, you eat more and move less! As little as 2-3 days of sleep deprivation (4 hours per night) is sever enough to significantly increase the ghrelin in your blood. Combined, the ghrelin and leptin changes after a couple of days of crappy sleep is enough to make you overeat, no question. Research strongly supports this conclusion1,2,3!  Click To Enlarge.2-3 Days Of Sleep Deprivation Is EnoughTo Make You Overeat, No Question.  Increased Time To Eat:  Let's say you're the kind of person who likes to eat every 2-3 hours. And let's also assume you're sleep deprived. Your body is giving you signals that you don't have enough energy and you are craving high-carb junk food.  A sleep loss of 3-4 hours would translate into at least one extra meal of poor-quality food, combined with little motivation to move and burn off the extra calories. In addition, both population and lab-based studies3 show that people actually eat more, on average, the less they sleep!

Don't Ask Me To Move. I'm Tired!   Low Leptin; Decreased Energy Expenditure:  Low leptin and high ghrelin levels are shown to reduce Non-Exercise-Activity-Thermogenesis. (NEAT) HUH? Well, NEAT is basically any movement you do that is not planned exercise. Most of the daily Calorie-burn is used to keep the body tickin'; NEAT is second and exercise is third.  So if NEAT activities subside significantly, the result can be more detrimental than skipping the gym! For instance, when you are tired at 3:00pm, do you feel like playing with your little niece or getting up to go talk to a co-worker? It's unlikely, and you've just given up some NEAT calorie-burn!   Lower Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH):  TSH is the hormone that stimulates, well, your thyroid, which then releases the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. These hormones are STRONGLY related to your metabolism. Sleep deprivation causes a lowering of TSH. In short, the thyroid gland will not be stimulated as much; T3 and T4 will not be fully made/released. Do not pass go; do not drop 20 lbs! Capisci?

If you wake up too early, this ghrelin drop will not happen and you may wake up hungrier than you should be, in addition to all the other obesigenic fun already described.  Furthermore, REM (dream) sleep is greater during the second half of the night. REM sleep is very important for a number of other reasons (long-term memory, etc), but you also burn more calories during REM that during the deeper sleep that predominated the earlier sleep cycles. So pass the 800 TC sheets and silence the cell phone!   Sleep Cycles: REM & NREM: Criteria for REM sleep include not only rapid eye movements, but also a rapid, low voltage EEG and, in mammals at least, low muscle tone. Most memorable dreaming occurs in this stage. NREM accounts for 75??""80% of total sleep time in normal human adults. In NREM sleep, there is relatively little dreaming. Non-REM encompasses four stages; stages 1 and 2 are considered 'light sleep', and 3 and 4 'deep sleep' or slow-wave sleep, SWS.

This condition is highly detrimental for a variety of reasons and really screws with all the hormones mentioned above.   RELATED POLL Do You Know Someone With Sleep Apnea?  Yes. www.sleepapnea.org No.     Obesity very strongly correlates with sleep apnea, which results in a positive feedback loop in the person with sleep apnea.

Personal Trainers Of The Month: The Educators
Meet three personal trainers who are committed to teaching the ins and outs of fitness to anyone in need, from kids to physique athletes to other trainers!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/personal-trainers-of-the-month-the-educators.html,"You may not immediately think of personal trainers as educators. That term is only for school teachers and professors, right? Well, Nick Clayton, Brandi Binkley, and Sergio Maldonado are changing that.  Their training styles, locations, and certifications are different, but their goals are the same. They want to leave this industry strongerand smarterthan when they found it! Trainer Of Trainers Nick ClaytonVital Stats Name: Nick Clayton Age: 36 Training Experience: 12 years Education/Certification: B.S. in fitness management and corporate health promotion; MS in exercise physiology; MBA; NSCA-CPT; NSCA-CSCS*D, NSCA-RSCC, USAW Location: Colorado Springs Contact Info: nick.clayton@nsc... Duties: Deliver presentations and sessions to develop personal trainers Athletic Background: Soccer, off-road triathlon Training Specialty: Injury prevention, mobility, metabolic conditioning  How do personal trainers learn how to train clients? They study under master trainers like Nick Clayton. As a manager at the National Strength and Conditioning Association in Colorado, Clayton helps prepare trainers for the gym floor.  He began his journey doing personal training for some extra cash in college, but quickly developed a love for the teaching aspects of the business. At his first gym in Gainesville, new PTs were put on a team with a master level trainer who was responsible with helping them develop.  The experience gave Clayton a lasting passion for practical training. While he grants that it's important for trainers to learn from colleges and universities, he's insistent that the central part of becoming a trainer is working with actual clients.  ""Most of the courses don't have a lot of hands-on training, like squat variations. That comes with experience,"" Clayton says. ""The degree helps you understand the fundamentals that go into training, but that's where a lot of people get stuck. They get their master's degree and assume they have all the knowledge they need. But they don't have practical experience. That only comes with working with hundreds of clients who all move differently and have different goals and athletic levels.""  Whose body should you start with? Yours! Clayton suggests that new PTs get involved and demonstrate their knowledge with their own bodies first. ""If you tell someone they have to squat to be strong, they want to see if you can squat. It's not about showing off or showing them up, but you have to be able to demonstrate it and know what they are going through, that you can do it yourself. You have to be a role model.""   ""That's where a lot of people get stuck. They get their master's degree and assume they have all the knowledge they need. But they don't have practical experience. That only comes with working with hundreds of clients who all move differently and have different goals and athletic levels."" Extra Points What are 3 things new trainers need to do before they put a client on the gym floor? Practice what you preach. Never ask a client to do something you have not at least tried yourself.Understand that every client is unique. This applies to their physical abilities, levels of self-confidence and self-efficacy, and learning style, just to name a few.Recognize that what you say and how you say it is just as important as the program you develop.Master Motivator Brandi BinkleyVital Stats Name: Brandi Binkley Age: 35 Training Experience: 13 years Education/Certification: M.S. in exercise physiology, NSCA-CPT Location: Nashville, TN Website: www.getphysiofit.com Contact Info: physiofitnashvil... Number of Clients: Personal, 45; Studio, 220 Rates: $45-95 Athletic Background: National-level figure competitor Training Specialties: Strength training, competition coaching, general fitness and quality of life.  Brandi Binkley grew up a natural athlete, and she scratched her itch with activities like cheerleading and dance team. Then, one day, she found herself bored. The same old routines weren't going to cut it anymore. What was a girl to do? She enrolled in the Navy, where she worked as a rescue swimmer.  Of course, this job wasn't without its risks. One day, Binkley injured her knee jumping from a helicopter, after which she switched to work with an F-18 squadron. When she left the military, depressed from weight gain after her injury, she began training. Encouraged by what she was capable of doing in the gym, she got a degree in exercise physiology and began eying a career as a personal trainer.  Through training, Binkley found a professional outlet that combined her dual passions of physical activity and military discipline. ""I expect a lot from clients. To show up, do what I ask, be present. I learned that on active duty,"" she says. ""It takes time, diligence to get things done.""  She opened her own facility in Nashville and was surprised by her success. ""The economy was ripe for what we do,"" she recalls. In less than two years, she had expanded her 1,800-square-foot facility to over 8,000 square feet, and she had to hire six trainers, a nutritionist, a prenatal/postpartum expert, and even an MD to fill it.  ""Collaboration is key, and we do that a lot in the training business,"" Binkley says. ""I collaborate with people who are better at what they do than I am. There are better nutritionists, people better at fixing injuries. We care about the people who are coming in. It's not about me, it's about them, and they see it and sense it.""   ""We care about the people who are coming in. It's not about me, it's about them, and they see it and sense it.""  So among all these experts, what is Binkley's specialty? ""It's my job not to just know exercise physiology, but to know each person and be able to look at them and tell them what they need,"" she says. ""I'm best at motivating and getting people to love exercise, creating fun programs that help them enjoy it.""  But don't take ""fun"" to mean ""light."" This former high-level figure competitor believes that there's no replacement for the big lifts. ""Everything we do is based on strength and conditioning, whether they are 70 or 17,"" she says. ""Don't forget old-school weightlifting: squat, bench, and deadlift. Trends don't cater to people who want to get onstage. People look better onstage when they have nice hard-earned dense muscle tissue. They diet down and look better than everyone else.""

Along the way, he has also bounced happily between fitness methods, including Pilates, Olympic lifting, yoga, powerlifting, and kettlebell training.  That resume may scream ""trainer,"" but Maldonado says it took him a while to see the writing on the wall. ""It was an accident!"" he says. ""After finding a part-time job at the YMCA, I thought working up to a personal trainer looked like fun. It wasand more!""  Eight years later, Maldonado is as open-minded a personal trainer as you'll find. He has to be in order to work with his two most prominent audiences: youth groups, and people of all ages who want to lose weight.  ""I can both learn and practice from so many fields, such as nutrition, training, psychology, rehabilitation, performance, and interpersonal skills,"" he says. ""Being able to constantly work on supplying help to my clients and athletes gives me so much purpose in my work.""  When it comes to working with youth, that purpose is clear. ""I think it's so important to establish a love for health and movement.""  Along the way, he has become certified as both a kettlebell instructor and a performance nutrition specialist, but Maldonado hasn't let his certifications define him. ""I'm not married to any one method, but the one that will work for you, which is why I equip myself with so many tools to help,"" he says. ""I feel that mindset, movement, recovery, and nutrition are the four key factors clients need to succeed. I work on improving them all.""   ""Being able to constantly work on supplying help to my clients and athletes gives me so much purpose in my work."" Extra Points What are 3 things children can do to get fit before they start lifting iron? Utilize body weight training, jumping, or medicine balls to build movement competency and capacity before adding external load.Develop an understanding of their sensations (feeling better, sleeping better, feeling fresh).Enjoy training, whether it is monotonous or boring; it takes a lot of the same work to be great."

If At First...
Being the competitive person that I am, I of course wanted to do well, but I wasn't expecting anything great. When I first entered the auditorium for the contestant meeting, I felt kind of lost.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simone2.htm,"October 2001: I entered my very first fitness competition after being recruited over 2&frac12; years earlier. Did I think I was prepared? No. Was I nervous? Well, not really...  I entered my first competition with the understanding that I was a newcomer and, quite frankly, I didn't have a clue what I was getting myself into. Being the competitive person that I am, I of course wanted to do well, but I wasn't expecting anything great.When I first entered the auditorium for the contestant meeting, I felt kind of lost.This meeting was so different from my sports team meetings that I had grown used to from my years in high school and college. Where were my teammates? Where was my coach? I was alone, but I was proud.Proud that I had made the commitment to compete at a different level, proud that I was fulfilling one of my goals. As the meeting continued, the head judge described how the swimsuit round would be conducted.All of the contestants were to walk out on stage for group comparisons, and then each contestant would need to take a turn posing for the judges individually. Morning Session I had seen this part of the competition on ESPN, so I kind of knew what I was supposed to be doing. When it came to the group comparisons, however, I had no idea how I was supposed to be posing. I actually had to look around while we were being judged to see what other girls were doing. The fitness routine was next. I felt most confident about this segment of the competition, as I had competed in gymnastics as a youth. As the competition continued, however, I grew slightly nervous that the stage would be slippery from the previous competition. The oil from the bodybuilders coated the surface of the stage and in some spots there were even small puddles. Although the crew members did their best to clean the stage, some residue was still present.I just prayed that I wouldn't hurt myself and tried to be optimistic. It was finally my turn, and I was as pumped up as the first time I set foot in the starting blocks for the 100 meter dash. My adrenaline was rushing a little too much as my nerves began to make me numb.As I set foot onto the stage, my music began without me. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I realized that I was not allowed to start over, but it wasn't my fault. I had told the director that I needed my music to start after I got on stage. They tried again. RELATED ARTICLE  My Journey Back To The Stage - Postpartum! The journey back was much harder than I could have ever imagined. I was prepared for the physical agony, but the emotional side... Read on to see how I made it back. [ Click here to learn more. ] When I was in place, my music started in the same place that it had ended minutes before. I thought to myself, there is no way this can be happening to me. All my time and efforts seemed wasted. I was livid at this point in time, which for me was good, because when I get mad, I get even.Actually, it calmed my nerves to the point that I felt like I needed to go out there and prove to everyone that I was good and deserved a chance. I had to wait until the next competitor took the stage before I could perform. I thought my chances were over, but I wanted to perform anyway. I had come so far and worked so hard that I wanted someone to see what I could do. As I took the stage for the third time there was announcement made that no points would be deducted due to technical difficulties with the music.I was unaware of this announcement prior to the competition, however, so I went on competing in a rage in hopes that I could make up for the music problems.I completed my routine relieved that the morning session was over. Night Session The night session was only for tie brakes and an audience show. I went out and performed with everything I had; however, the stage was more slippery than the morning session. My hand slipped on my round-off and I could not perform one of my skills as I was sitting in a puddle of oil. I figured it was all over. I had failed and there was no turning back. I would just use this experience as a lesson learned. When the top 5 contestants were called that night, I was not among them. I was not surprised, but again, being the competitive person that I am, I was very disappointed.After the competition was over, I took some extra time to meet with a few judges to find out what things I could improve upon for the next competition. I learned that my three-inch heels did not give me the length in my legs that a six-inch heel would, that my halter bikini top looked too much like a shirt top, my skirt for my routine was too long, and my shoes were too flashy.I also learned that my muscle definition was washed out under the stage lights and this could be fixed by applying professional tanning dyes. Other than that, I was told that my routine needed to flow together a little better, as my movements did not have smooth transitions. After hearing so many things that I could improve upon, I was excited once again. RELATED ARTICLE  Should I Get On The Fitness Stage? So many people have the desire to compete, but fear losing or not looking their best. If you want to compete, you should! I encourage participation in competition when the desire is there. [ Click here to learn more. ] Much to my surprise, about a week after the competition, I received a telephone call stating that I had placed in the top 10 (I later found out that I placed 7th out of 16 ladies) and qualified for Nationals! I was so excited, but I didn't know how I was going to make so many changes in a month's time.Needless to say, I made as many changes as I could in a short amount of time, but I was not totally prepared for the Fitness America Pageant Finals. I ended up placing 44th out of 96 competitors. I was happy with my results, as my goal was to place in the top half. I had the opportunity to meet many wonderful athletes, and I learned so much more about what it takes to be one of the best. This past April, I entered my third fitness competition in Pennsylvania. I walked away with a 2nd place trophy, which qualified me for this year's Fitness America Pageant-ESPN Finals.Although I was confident in my performance and I received the audiences support, I feel as though the couple of tenths that separated me from winning is a sign that my work is not done. Conclusion One of my favorite quotes comes from ""The Butterfly"" (author unknown), ""Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If God allowed us to go through our lives without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. We could never fly!""So, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again - for one day all the hard work will allow you to soar to the top!Good Luck, and God Bless!"

Bodybuilding & The Endocrine System!
The remainder of this article will explain exactly how the endocrine system functions, and how exercise can positively effect this functioning. Key hormones, and respective endocrine glands, that are both affected by exercise and responsible...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson28.htm,"Many health benefits are to be gained through bodybuilding. In fact, bodybuilding's training regimes and dietary practices can enhance cardiovascular, mental and immune health and improve weight loss. One aspect of health that is not often touched on, when bodybuilding's benefits are discussed, is the endocrine (or hormonal) system.  The endocrine system (from the Greek terms ""endo"" meaning within and ""krine"" meaning to separate or secrete) is comprised of chemical substances called hormones which serve as messengers, passing information from endocrine gland to organ, to control a large number of physiologic functions. To ensure these functions are governed efficiently, effective hormonal control is of paramount importance.  Exercise is one of the best ways to beneficially assist the release and reception of hormones. Studies have shown that exercise actually increases the amount of circulating hormones in our bodies as well as strengthening the receptor sites on their target organ cells.  The remainder of this article will explain exactly how the endocrine system functions, and how exercise can positively effect this functioning. Key hormones, and respective endocrine glands, that are both affected by exercise and responsible for bodybuilding success will be discussed.  The Endocrine System   The endocrine systems glands manufacture and secrete hormones, which communicate with specific organs and, in concert with the nervous and immune systems, enable vital functions to occur within our bodies. The endocrine glands are ductless, which means they secrete the hormones they manufacture directly into the bloodstream to be taken to the appropriate target organ, upon which these hormones act.  Specific cells on the target organ which act as binding sites (hormone receptors) recognize the shape of each hormone and allow it to enter (a lock and key mechanism).  Hormones bring their characteristic effects on target cells by modifying cellular activity, and given that they are very potent substances, hormones need to be tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis.  Many hormones are controlled through what is termed a negative feedback mechanism, which causes a reversal of increases or decreases in the concentration of a particular hormone, to maintain homeostasis. This negative feedback mechanism illustrates just how sensitive a target organ is to the hormone it receives.  The Major Endocrine Glands Are:  The thyroid Parathyroid Adrenal Pituitary Pineal gland Pancreas Testes Ovaries  Organs that are hormonally active as part of their function, but are not endocrine glands per se, are:Thymus Stomach Heart Small-intestine Placenta Although the endocrine glands are scattered throughout the body, and serve different functions, they are considered a system because they have similar mechanisms of influence and functions, and many important relationships.  The Three General Classes Of Hormones Classified By Their Protein or Steroid Chemical Structure Are: Amino Acid Derivatives: as the name suggests these are derived from amino acids; tyrosine in particular. Epinephrine for example is an amino acid derived hormone.  Steroid Hormones: these include prostaglandins and all are lipids, made from cholesterol.  Peptide Hormones: the biggest group of hormones, peptides are short chains of amino acids. Insulin for example is a peptide hormone.  * It is interesting to note that, in fact, all of the hormones in our body are derivatives of proteins or proteins themselves, except for the those in the adrenal cortex and the sex hormones, which are steroid hormones. Steroid hormones typically react with receptor sites inside a cell because the process is slower as protein synthesis is required, whereas protein hormones react with receptors on the surface of a cell in a more rapid fashion.   Key hormones beneficially affected by exercise are: Testosterone Growth hormone Estrogen Thyroxine Epinephrine Insulin Endorphins Glucagon Testosterone   Both males and females produce testosterone, which is a key bodybuilding hormone, as it increases basal metabolic rate, decreases body fat, increases feelings of self-confidence, and maintains muscle volume, tone and strength. In fact, testosterone, along with growth hormone, is responsible for the hypertrophy (increased size and density) of muscle cells as well as the repair of micro-tears in the muscle tissue.   Females have only about one tenth of the testosterone males have, but even at that level, powerful effects are exerted: libido and strength of orgasm for example. The process underlying testosterones release is rather complex.  Firstly, the hypothalamus (situated in the brain), releases gonadotrophin releasing hormone to the anterior pituitary gland, which, in turn, releases luteinizing hormone, which travels to the Leydig cells of the testes and stimulates the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to Testosterone.  Ancient Greek texts prescribed the ingestion of  bull testicles to treat loss of energy! The key to boosting testosterone levels through exercise is to concentrate on the larger muscle groups while avoiding training the same body-part two days in a row.  It has also been shown that a higher level of training intensity can be achieved in the morning as it is then that testosterone levels are at their highest. Consequently, greater gains could theoretically be made at this time.  Repetitions should be kept low, while a correspondingly heavy weight is lifted, if testosterone boosting is ones aim. 85% of ones one-repetition-maximum for 1-2 reps is best.  In essence, the best form of training for testosterone increase is short, intense, anaerobic session. With aerobic training, shorter, 45-minute sessions are ideal as testosterone is depressed is this period is exceeded.  Learn more about testosterone, click here.  Growth Hormone   Growth hormone which is released from the brains pituitary gland is an important bodybuilding hormone. It stimulates protein synthesis, and helps to strengthen bones, ligaments, tendons and cartilage. It also plays a role in fat mobilization, and the corresponding decrease in carbohydrate usage, during exercise.   As a result, body fat is used and blood glucose levels are balanced which allows one to train over a longer period of time (without exceeding the testosterone maximizing 45-minute period of course).  Increases in growth hormone provide a multitude of immediate benefits which include, increased energy, ability to concentrate, and interest and ability in sex (Kennedy, 2004). Longer-term benefits include, increased aerobic capacity and strength, thickening of hair, tightening of wrinkles and loose skin, decrease in visceral fat, and strengthening of osteoporotic bones (Kennedy, 2004).  Growth hormone production is reduced significantly as we age and can be prescribed to offset the negative effects of aging. However, without going to extremes, one can increase their output of growth hormone in the most effective natural way possible: though exercise.  For increased growth hormone the most productive form of exercise is vigorous, sustained anaerobic training. Adopt the same strategy as when training for testosterone release and, target the large muscle groups, the quads in particular. Train no longer than 30 minutes when specifically aiming to increase growth hormone.  This applies to aerobic training also, which should be undertaken at a very high intensity; bordering on anaerobic. Interval training is the ideal.  Learn more about growth hormone, click here.  Estrogen   The beneficial effects of estrogen, in its most biologically active form, 17 beta estradiol, include, fat mobilisation for fuel, mood elevation, increased basal metabolic rate, and libido in women primarily. As a woman ages her estrogen levels vary to regulate the reproductive system and are reduced significantly by the time she reaches menopause.    bmr_calculator();    A study by Copeland, Consitt and Tremblay, reported that blood levels of estrogen, were significantly higher in women aged 19-69 years old after 40 minutes of either endurance or resistance exercise versus a control group who performed no exercise. Furthermore, blood levels of estrogen remain elevated for up to four-hours following an exercise session.  Learn more about estrogen, click here.  Thyroxine    This hormone is produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland and its main role is to raise the body's metabolic rate. It is therefore a key hormone for weight-loss, as more calories are expended through its release. Thyroxine has an additional effect of influencing physical development.   Thyroxine increases in the blood by about 30% during exercise and remains elevated for up to five hours afterward. The intensity should be kept high to realise maximum benefit. Thyroxine levels at rest are also increased through exercise.  Epinephrine    Produced in the adrenal medulla, epinephrine, a neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system, increases the amount of blood the heart pumps and directs the blood to where it is needed - the extremities. Epinephrine is one of the catecholamines, the other being norepinephrine, and both are synthesised from the amino acid  tyrosine.   Epinephrine also stimulates the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and muscles and stored fat to be used as fuel. Vasodilation in muscle and liver vasculatures results also from increased epinephrine release. This allows the muscle to receive more oxygenated blood, increasing our ability to use these muscles while exercising.  To increase epinephrine exercise sessions, once again, need to be very intense. The amount of epinephrine released from the medulla is proportional to exercise intensity. Insulin    Insulin, produced in the islet cells of the pancreas, is an important hormone which decreases (regulates) blood levels of glucose and directs amino acids and fatty acids into cells.   Most of our body's cells have insulin receptors, which are composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits linked by disulfide bonds, and bind the circulating insulin. The cell then can activate other receptors which are designed to absorb glucose (sugar) from the blood stream into the cell.   Examples Of Insulin  Name of Insulin Start Activity Highest ActivityEnds Activity Low BSVery short-acting (Humalog) 10 minutes 1.5 hours 3 hours 2-4 hours Short-acting (Regular/-R) 20 minutes 3-4 hours 8 hours 3-7 hoursIntermediate acting (Nor L) 1.5-2 hours 4-15 hours 22-24 hours 6-13 hoursLong-acting (Ultra Lente) 4 hours 10-24 hours 36 hours 12-28 hoursCombination: 70% N/30% R 0-1 hour 3-13 hours 12-20 hours 3-12 hoursCombination: 50% N/50% R 0-1 hour 3-12 hours 12-20 hours 3-12 hoursHumalog was administered about 15 minutes before an appropriate meal Regular Type-R was administered 30 minutes before an appropriate meal Low BS = Low blood sugar (Glucose). Note: This is an excert from an Author L. Rea article.    An insulin response ensues after a meal has been consumed. An excessive insulin response causes fat to accumulate within cells, and, over time, those who frequently experience such responses can become overweight and their cells may develop a resistance to insulin (diabetes).  Weight loss through daily aerobic and weight-training can help to rectify this situation, depending on the type of diabetes they have. One may be fortunate to escape diabetes, but they will likely become overweight with continual, excessive insulin responses.  Therefore, it is important to exercise to help offset any potential blood sugar problems. Blood-insulin levels begin to decrease within ten minutes of aerobic training and continue to decrease as the session progresses. Weight training has been shown to increase the cells sensitivity (receptivity) to insulin at rest.  Learn more about insulin, click here.  Endorphins    Released from the pituitary gland, the endorphins are an endogenous opioid class of chemicals produced under conditions of pain, which block this pain, decrease appetite, create a feeling of euphoria and reduce tension and anxiety. Biochemically, endorphins are polypeptide neurotransmitters, containing 30 amino acid units.   Exercising is particularly beneficial in terms of endorphin release. In fact blood levels of endorphins increase above resiting levels up to five times with longer duration (over 30 minutes) aerobic exercise at moderate to intense levels. An increased sensitivity to endorphins is developed after several months of regular exercise.  This means that a higher high will arise from the same training stimulus. Although longer duration exercise is suggested as a rule, it is rather arbitrary, as individual variability dictates how one will experience the effect of endorphins.  Glucagon     As with insulin, glucagon, a linear peptide of 29 amino acids, is secreted by the pancreas. Its main role, in contradiction to insulin however, is to increase blood glucose levels. Glucagon is synthesized as proglucagon and proteolytically (the hydrolysis of proteins into simpler compounds through the actions of enzymes) processed to yield glucagon within alpha cells of the pancreatic islets.   Glucagon exerts its physiologic effects in two ways: It is secreted when blood sugar falls too low, and this causes carbohydrate in the liver to be released into the blood stream, which raises blood sugar levels to normal.  It activates hepatic gluconeogenesis. This process involves the conversion of amino acids into glucose to be used as energy.  Researchers Bonjorn, Latour, Belanger and Lavoie, from Montreal University, found that exercise enhanced the livers sensitivity to glucagon. This demonstrates the effect exercise, and its facilitation of glucagon, has on nutritional conversion for energy purposes. Glucagon is typically secreted about 30 minutes into an exercise session, at the onset of blood glucose reduction. Conclusion   As demonstrated in this article, hormones, and their multifarious complex interactions, underpin many of our most important biological functions. These fascinating molecules go about their job in relative obscurity, while we conduct out daily affairs, completely dependant on their respective roles.  Indeed, the efficient functioning of our endocrine system is very important, and through exercising diligently we can play a role in its upkeep.  References  Bloom, W.(2001). The Endorphin Effect.

Both words, caffeine and coffee, are derived from the Arabic word qahweh (pronounced ""kahveh"" in Turkish). Coffee trees were cultivated in the 6th century and coffee itself began to be popular in Europe in the 17th century. By the 18th century plantations had been established in Indonesia and the West Indies. The Modern WorldIt's hardly a coincidence that coffee and tea caught on in Europe just as the first factories were ushering in the industrial revolution. The widespread use of caffeinated drinks - replacing the ever popular beer - facilitated the great transformation of human economic endeavor from the farm to the factory.Boiling water to make coffee or tea helped decrease the incidence of disease among workers in crowded cities. And the caffeine in their systems kept them from falling asleep over the machinery. In a sense, caffeine is the drug that made the modern world possible. And the more modern our world gets, the more we seem to need it.  Caffeine & Sleep: Without that useful jolt of coffee - or Diet Coke or Red Bull - to get us out of bed and back to work, the 24-hour society of the developed world couldn't exist.""For most of human existence, your pattern of sleeping and wakefulness was basically a matter of the sun and the season,"" explains Charles Czeisler, a neuroscientist and sleep expert at Harvard Medical School. ""When the nature of work changed from a schedule built around the sun to an indoor job timed by a clock, humans had to adapt. The widespread use of caffeinated food and drink-in combination with the invention of electric light-allowed people to cope with a work schedule set by the clock, not by daylight or the natural sleep cycle.""Scientists have developed various theories to explain caffeine's ""wake-promoting"" power. The consensus today focuses on the drug's interference with adenosine, a chemical in the body that acts as a natural sleeping pill.  RELATED ARTICLE Chemically Correct: CaffeineDespite how caffeine affects my individual biochemistry, I find its widespread use fascinating. Here are my discoveries of a drug that is socially accepted by all ages. [ Click here to learn more. ] Caffeine blocks the hypnotic effect of adenosine and keeps us from falling asleep. Since caffeine has also been shown to enhance mood and increase alertness in moderate amounts, it's a potent potion for students and scholars stuck in the lab at three in the morning.  Caffeine & Workouts: Caffeine is used by fitness enthusiasts to get more out of their workouts. Once thought of as a 'health no-no' for athletes, caffeine is taking center stage as a legitimate aid to performance. This benefit has been recognized by the makers of sports nutrition products like energy gels (see chart below).A growing body of laboratory research supports caffeine as an effective ergogenic aid (An ergogenic aid is a substance that improves athletic performance). The most dramatic performance improvements (20-50 percent) are seen during prolonged (over two-hours) endurance exercise. To View Top Selling Caffeine Products Click Here.  Sleep Murderer: Caffeine is also reported to benefit short-term intense exercise lasting about five minutes at maximal output. Caffeine's ability to murder sleep also makes it a drug of choice for long-distance travelers. There are as many different jet-lag remedies as there are seats on a trans-Pacific flight.But one approach, outlined in The Caffeine Advantage by Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer, involves abstaining from caffeine for several days before traveling, then dosing yourself with small amounts of coffee or tea on the day you arrive to stay alert-preferably out in the sunshine-until your regular bedtime in your destination.""Caffeine helps people try to wrest control away from the human circadian rhythm that is hardwired in all of us,"" says Czeisler. But then a shadow crosses the doctor's sunny face and his tone changes sharply. ""On the other hand,"" he says solemnly, ""there is a heavy, heavy price that has been paid for all this extra wakefulness.""CAFFEINE INTAKE CALCULATOR        To find out your average daily caffeine intake        41 (in milligrams), fill in how many servings you consume per day for each of these items:        Unfortunately, this calculator won&apos;t run without JavaScript. We&apos;re sorry for the inconvenience. Without adequate sleep - the conventional eight hours out of each 24 is about right - the human body will not function at its best, physically, mentally, or emotionally, the doctor says. ""As a society, we are tremendously sleep deprived.""In fact, the professor goes on; there is a sort of catch-22 at the heart of the modern craving for caffeine. ""The principal reason that caffeine is used around the world is to promote wakefulness,"" Czeisler says. ""But the principal reason that people need that crutch is inadequate sleep.""""Think about that: We use caffeine to make up for a sleep deficit that is largely the result of using caffeine.""Caffeine Effects During PregnancyIf consuming caffeine in general is something many people shouldn't do, then what about women who are pregnant? Safety of caffeine consumption during pregnancy is controversial. Some studies suggest that small amounts of caffeine (less than two average cups) of coffee per day presents a slight risk to the embryo or fetus, while others do not.There is stronger evidence that larger daily amounts of caffeine during pregnancy may increase the risks of miscarriage, preterm delivery and low birth weight, but no solid proof.High caffeine intake during pregnancy should be avoided. A pregnant woman may be able to tolerate more than her fetus can. Related Articles: So You're Pregnant: Now What?Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide!Working Out With Children.Other Pregnancy Articles...Risks of even small amounts of caffeine consumption are not clear. Women trying to become pregnant may conceive sooner if they limit caffeine intake to less then two cups daily. Breastfeeding women can minimize infants' exposures to caffeine by avoiding a very high caffeine intake. Caffeine's Effects On Women's Fertility:Some studies have found a link between high levels of caffeine consumption by women and delayed conception. Women who consumed more than 300 mg of caffeine per day were twice as likely to have conception delayed for a year or more.1 Another study also linked high caffeine intake to delayed conception, but only in women consuming 500 mg or more (about four cups of coffee) per day.2Best to keep your caffeine intake below 300 mg a day. Caffeine's Effects On The Developing Fetus:Caffeine easily passes from mother to fetus through the placenta. A developing fetus may have higher, sustained blood levels of caffeine than its mother because of immature metabolism.3 A few studies have shown that consuming even small amounts of caffeine can affects fetal heart rate and movement patterns.3 A pregnant woman's ability to metabolize caffeine slows as pregnancy progresses, so some of its effects may increase later in pregnancy.Some studies have found that pregnant women who consumed large quantities of caffeine (five or more cups of coffee a day) were twice as likely to miscarry as those who consumed less, while fewer or no effects were seen at lower levels of caffeine consumption.4, 5 A detailed analysis of caffeine's reported effects on pregnancy outcome can be found at motherisk.org. Excerpt From MothersRisk.org[ Q ] Many of my female patients, those who plan pregnancy or have conceived, are afraid of any intake of caffeine. This often makes their lives miserable during pregnancy. Is this justified scientifically?           [ A ] Motherisk's recent meta-analysis suggests that the risks for miscarriage and fetal growth retardation increase only with daily doses of caffeine above 150 mg/d, equivalent to 1.5 cups (250mL/cup) of coffee a day. It is possible that some of this presumed risk is due to confounders, such as cigarette smoking.  Caffeine's Affects On Newborns & Infants: High caffeine consumption during pregnancy may shorten gestation and lower birth weight.6 Both effects appear modest in terms of days and ounces, but may be important to an infant already compromised by prematurity or fetal growth restriction. Such effects have not been consistently linked to moderate consumption.7A reported link between heavy maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and increased risk of SIDS8 (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) has not been supported by further studies.9Breast milk can transfer caffeine from mother to baby. Very high caffeine intake by a nursing mother may make her baby irritable, with disturbed sleep cycles, but this is not known to occur from ordinary food and beverage caffeine intake, or without use of medications containing caffeine. Tips On Cutting Caffeine Out Before Pregnancy... Men, Please Join Us!To cut caffeine out of your diet can be difficult. Many will experience side effects like headaches and cravings. To reduce the risks of these side effects it is recommended that you cut back slowly. For example, a coffee drinker should start with 3/4 of a cup of regular coffee and add 1/4 of decaffeinated coffee. Slowly they will increase the decaffeinated coffee until it is the entire cup.Whether you discontinue caffeine cold turkey or slowly, it will help you to achieve a healthier pregnancy. It is also helpful to have your partner discontinue caffeine with you.Click To Enlarge.Using Caffeine Or Green Tea During A Contest Will Help You Win Your Contest.So as you prepare for pregnancy by eliminating hazards from your diet and life, remember a healthy body helps produce a healthy baby! At the age of 30, I look back at when I took my first sip.

When a woman is pregnant, her whole training program has to change. Warnings:Pregnant women should not perform squats, because it can cause the separation of the placenta from the uterus. Also, jerky movements should not be performed. Make sure only light weights are used and every exercise should be done slow and correctly.Remember to breathe when exercising, because you don't want your baby to lose oxygen. Make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before and after you work out. As far as eating goes, eat healthy and eat often. Try to get in 4 to 5 small meals a day. Workout: What is the best workout for pregnant women? Be specific. Include exercises, sets, reps, rest periods, etc. The training program includes light weight training along with cardio. I've included all the major body parts, except for the abdominals and the lower back muscles. I don't think it's safe to train these two muscle groups when pregnant.The training goal of pregnant women isn't to bulk up, but to stay fit, that's why only light weights will be used. Heavy weights shouldn't be used when pregnant, because you could end up hurting yourself and your baby. Each exercise has 3 sets with 15 reps each. Rest periods should be quite short. Keep rest periods between 2 to 3 minutes.Another thing that is important to mention is that a lot of pregnant women have is back pain. This is mainly because 25-30 pounds of weight is gained during pregnancy, with most of the weight distributed around the abdominal area.  RELATED ARTICLE  Back Pain: How Exercise Can Help.   While any form of back pain should be assessed by a qualified medical practitioner, certain exercises can greatly reduce the pain. There are many exercises you can do to improve and prevent back injuries. I have listed those exercises right here. [ Click here to learn more. ] This causes a women's center gravity to shift forward, which results in more curvature in her lower spinal column. A solution for this is stretching. Light stretching should be done occasionally after you warm-up, especially if you want to prevent back pain.Along with weight training is cardio. One of the best cardiovascular activities pregnant women can do is swimming. Swimming can help strengthen your heart muscles and also improve oxygen delivery to the muscles. Swimming also strengthens your shoulder and abdominal muscles, and it reduces high blood pressure and joint stiffness.Swimming is also one of the most relaxing cardiovascular exercises. But when it comes to relaxing exercises, yoga is number one. Yoga is very relaxing and beneficial to pregnant women. Yoga can help you prepare your mind and your body for one of the most fearful parts of pregnancy, labor and birth of your baby.  RELATED ARTICLE  Yoga: Tips And Exercises For Pregnancy.

The training program above gives you the weekend off, so you can rest and pursue your other interests. Every 2 or 3 months, I recommend that you take a whole week off.Also make sure you change your training program a bit every couple of weeks or months. Talk to your doctor as often as possible, to make sure you're in good health. I recommend that you keep a training log and show it to your doctor to make sure that he or she approves of it.  RELATED ARTICLE  So You're Pregnant: Now What?   It is the time many women wait for all their lives. The time when they are going to produce a life of their own. Some people will spend years trying to become pregnant, hoping and praying. [ Click here to learn more. ] Include your workouts and your diet in your training log. For your workouts, write down what time you went and left from the gym, and all the exercises performed along with sets and reps. For your diet, write down everything you ate, the time you ate, the number of calories, and how many grams of fat, carbs, and protein you took in each meal.Do this on a daily basis, and when you give birth to your baby and look back at everything you did, you'll be amazed and proud of your accomplishments.I hope that this article will help you meet your goals while you're pregnant. Just remember to follow through with your goal. Good Luck! 2nd Place - -CK, NSCA-CPT IntroductionTraining while pregnant has many great benefits for the mother as well as the baby. It is very important to get a doctors permission before exercising while pregnant. Although it is usually accepted by doctors it is not a good idea to start an exercise program once found out to be pregnant.The only way exercise should be done during a pregnancy is if the expecting mother was exercising prior to the pregnancy. Exercise should be discontinued if there is bloody discharge from the vagina, any gush of fluid from the vagina, sudden swelling of extremities, severe headaches, dizziness, or swelling and pain in the calf of a leg.High risk exercises should be avoided. Common sense would tell most but snow or water skiing, rock climbing, contact sports, scuba diving, any exercise that involves balance, etc. Cardiovascular Changes:The female body goes through a wide variety of physiological changes during pregnancy. The cardiovascular system is impacted tremendously during pregnancy. Blood volume is increased by 40-50%. Cardiac output increases by 30-50%. Stroke volume is increased by 40%.The resting heart rate increases by 8 beats per minute during the first few weeks of the pregnancy. Resting heart rate is increased even more, up to 20 beats per minute by 32 weeks. The female body's oxygen consumption is increased by 10-20%.By the 2nd or 3rd trimester there is a decrease in maximal work capacity by 20-25%. The use of an RPE (rate of perceived exhaustion) scale is favored over the use of heart rate monitors during pregnancy. Hormonal & Metabolic Changes:There are changes in the levels of progesterone, relaxin and estrogen during pregnancy. The changes in these hormones cause a growth of the uterus as well as breast tissue. There is a decrease in smooth muscle tone as well. The changes in hormones also cause a softening of the ligaments around the joints.This is especially found to be true in the lumbosacral and pelvic areas. The hormone changes usually cause nausea, vomiting, and a decrease in appetite. This is normally during the first trimester. With the metabolic changes a pregnant women should consume an excess of 300 k/cal daily. Musculoskeletal System Changes:The average weight gain of women during pregnancy is 27.5 lbs. With the excess weight gain comes postural changes. They in turn create muscular imbalances. The abdominal wall is stretched. The lumbar spine muscles are shortened and the upper back muscles become long and week. The anterior muscles of the chest and shoulders become really tight. As the baby's head shifts forward muscular activity in the posterior cervical region increase.Benefits Of Exercise During PregnancyWomen can maintain or increase their cardiovascular fitness as well as muscle strength and flexibility. They can also experience less pre-natal discomforts. Some of these discomforts include constipation, swollen extremities, leg cramps, nausea, varicose veins, insomnia, fatigue, back pain, and other orthopedic conditions.Women can improve their posture along with body mechanics. They can also increase their energy levels and blood flow circulation. Women who exercise while pregnant maintain a lower resting heart rate. They also have increased stroke volume and VO2 max.  VO2MAX CALCULATOR  Enter the total distance covered in meters in 12 minutes and then press the 'Calculate' button.  1600 meters = 1 mile 5280 feet = 1 mile 3 feet = 1 meterDistance   meters  ResultsVo2 Max  There is a major decrease in excessive weight gain. There is a major decrease in delivery problems. There is a 75% decrease in having to have a c-section. There is also a 75% decrease in maternal exhaustion. There is a 50% decrease for the need of oxytocin (which helps induce labor).It has been show that there is a 30% decrease in active labor time. After delivery during recovery time it has been shown that there are fewer incidences of post partum depression.Pre-Natal ExerciseThere is not a ""one size fits all"" workout. It needs to be individualized for the pregnant women. They should workout at a level of comfort. That should be between 5-8 on a RPE (rate of perceived exhaustion) scale of 1-10. As the pregnancy progresses farther along it will take smaller levels of work to attain the same RPE.They should always avoid exercising to exhaustion. The duration of exercise should be determined by the intensity. So if the intensity increases the duration must decrease. Cardiovascular exercise should be no longer than 45 minutes in duration.  RELATED ARTICLE  Weight Training & Pregnancy!   After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries. This article will provide guidelines on pre-natal exercise and other health considerations. [ Click here to learn more. ] In the 3rd trimester fetal nutrition and energy balance are very important. If more calories are burned during exercise more must be consumed to help balance out the energy levels. Eating more amounts in the 3rd trimester may be difficult stomach space is smaller and the risk of heartburn.Exercise frequency should be 3-5 days per week. Some studies have shown that women who exercised 5 days per week gave birth to lower weight babies. The only reason for lower birth weights was they had less subcutaneous fat than others. After 5 years those babies showed no differences than babies born at the same time from non-active mothers.It is important to take care of any muscular imbalances caused from the pregnancy. They can lead to discomfort, pain or even injury. The most important muscles to strengthen would be the scapular retractors, abdominals, and pelvic floor. The transverse abdominals should be trained in isolation at first then integrated into other exercises.A strong pelvic floor will help improve controlling and relaxing during labor. These are the five layers of muscle and fascia attached to the pelvis. They support the internal organs and affect bladder, bowel, and sexual functions. Kegal exercises are a great way to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor.

Sucralose: Is This Sweetener Right For You?
Sucralose is the only non-nutritive sweetener made from sugar. Is it safe? Should you use it? Find out here!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/vm2.htm,"Life just got a bit sweeter, actually about 600 times sweeter! The FDA has approved the newest form of no-calorie sweetener, known as Sucralose. Sucralose, made by McNeil Specialty Products (Johnson &Johnson), is the only non-nutritive sweetener made from sugar. It is significantly sweeter than Aspartame, Ace-K, and Saccharin. Because of its origin, it tastes like sugar, but has added benefits and unique properties. Sucralose is exceptionally stable, even in low-pH items (certain beverages), under high temperatures (useful in baking and pasteurization), and in its stand-alone state (tabletop). Its shelf life is superior to all other leading sweeteners. These attributes are the backbone of its outstanding processing versatility. This is a giant step ahead considering that the current limited use of sweeteners in commercial products is primarily due to instability over time and at high temperatures (e.g. Aspartame, or NutraSweet), and due to taste limitations such as with Saccharin and Acesulfame-K (Ace-K).  The taste profile of sucralose is almost identical to sucrose (table sugar). The data above compare the two at neutral pH in a 5% solution. Structurally, Sucralose is almost identical to sucrose. The three hydroxyl groups (-OH) of sucrose have been selectively replaced with atoms of chlorine. These tightly bound chlorine atoms help create a molecular structure that is extremely stable, 600 times sweeter than sugar, a perfect match for sweet taste bud receptors, and metabolically inert. Sucralose flows throughout the body almost unabsorbed and causing no GI distress (often noted with similar additives such as Olestra). It is rapidly excreted, not hydrolyzed or dechlorinated following ingestion, and does not promote dental caries (cavities) nor support the growth of oral bacteria, nor cause changes in the pH of plaque (1, 2, 3). Sucralose is minimally metabolized, leaving the metabolites nontoxic and excreted in urine. Although not a diabetic, as a health care professional I have great appreciation for this advancement because I am involved with diabetic patients everyday in the clinical setting. Because the body does not recognize Sucralose as a carbohydrate, it has no effect on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels (4, 5). The American Dietetic Association states that non-nutritive sweeteners are safe to use and widely advocated and used by persons with diabetes(5). Whether diabetic, obese, or just a health conscious individual, Sucralose is the answer to reducing sugar intake or calorie intake in order to continue enjoying favorite foods. [EDITORS NOTE: The substitution of sugar may also have important implications for weight trainers with sore muscles who commonly experience a state of acute glucose intolerance.] Sucralose also has a few other positive aspects within the realm of health care. It can be used by pregnant women and nursing mothers. Studies have confirmed that Sucralose is not actively transported across the placenta or across mammary glands into breast milk. This sweetener has been found to be non-hazardous to a developing young persons health. However, due to the importance of calories for a growing childs body, foods made with low-calories sweeteners are not normally recommended. Sucralose does not contain phenylalanine (as does Aspartame) or any other additional amino acids, posing no threat to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Quick Fact: Did you know that Americans consume more than DOUBLE the recommended amount of sugar?T he FDA has reviewed over 110 studies involving humans and animals conducted to prove that the consumption of Sucralose is safe. There were also 40 environmental studies completed. These studies depicted that even in extremely high doses there is no evidence of side effects, increased chances of birth defects, immune system problems, toxicity, carcinogenic properties (unlike saccharin), genetic changes, negative effects on male/female reproduction (nor on progeny), or adverse CNS effects. The lack of a warning label for its use is a definite ""feather in the cap"" for Sucralose. After reviewing the numerous studies completed and extensive data, it is obvious that Sucralose will make a run at becoming the best choice ever among low-calorie sweeteners.

Use Of Nutritive And Nonnutritive Sweeteners.
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/md26.htm,"5/1/2003 - It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  J Am Diet Assoc. 1998;98:580-587.  Human beings are born liking the sensation of sweetness. A number of food ingredients stimulate this sensation by interacting with taste buds in the mouth and throat. The sweetening power of these ingredients varies with the properties of the food system, such as physical state, temperature, and the presence of other flavors. Furthermore, perception of sweet taste can be influenced by genetics, health status, and aging (1).  Nutritive sweeteners provide a sweet taste and a source of energy; nonnutritive sweeteners are sweet without providing energy. The claim that nutritive sweeteners have caused an increase in chronic disease (eg, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dental caries, behavioral disorders) is not substantiated (2) but many consumers want the taste of sweetness without added energy.  The food industry has responded to this demand by producing a number of energy-reduced or nonnutritive sweeteners.  Position Statement   It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  Types Of Sweeteners   Although sweeteners can be grouped a number of different ways, the grouping ""nutritive"" and ""nonnutritive"" acknowledges a difference in the amount of energy provided by sweeteners. Nutritive sweeteners include sugar sweeteners (eg, refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, crystalline fructose, glucose, dextrose, corn sweeteners, honey, lactose, maltose, various syrups, invert sugars, concentrated fruit juice) and reduced-energy polyols or sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates).  Nonnutritive sweeteners (eg, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame-K, and sucralose) offer no energy, and, as they sweeten with little volume, can also be referred to as high-intensity sweeteners. Both polyols and nonnutritive sweeteners can replace sugar sweeteners and are therefore termed macronutrient substitutes, sugar substitutes, sugar replacers, or alternative sweeteners.  Some sweeteners are considered Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) ingredients and others are considered food additives. These terms were defined by the 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The 1958 amendment also states that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve the safety of all additives (3). The safety limit of food additives or conditions of use are expressed as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), that is, the estimated amount per kilogram body weight that a person can safely consume every day over a lifetime without risk.  ADI is a conservative level--it usually reflects an amount 100 times less than the maximum level at which no observed adverse effect occurs in animal (very occasionally human being) studies. The ADI concept is used by FDA and the Joint Expert Committee of Food Additions (JECFA) of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization.  The table provides a summary of the amount of energy provided, the regulatory status, and descriptions of the approved nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners.

Nutritive Sweeteners   The 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey provides estimates of nutritive sweetener consumption in the United States (4,5). Total intake of sugars (those added and naturally occurring in foods) was 94 to 95 g/day for the total population or 21% to 22% of total energy intake. Of this total, sugars added to food were estimated at 53 g/day (4).  The major sources of total sugar for children younger than age 10 years were milk/milk products, fruit drinks, and carbonated soft drinks (5). In adults aged 25 to 50 years, the top 3 food categories contributing to total sugar intake were: other (candy and gum, coffee/tea/alcohol, miscellaneous foods, carbonated soft drinks, and fruit drinks); milk/milk products; and bread, cereal, rice, and pasta (includes cookies, cakes, and pastries).  Consumers can monitor their intake of total sugars through the labels on foods and beverages. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (6) defines labeling of sugars (ie, any monosaccharide or disaccharide) and sugar alcohols. The Act also includes guidelines for labeling a product as ""sugar-free"" (less than 0.5 g sugar), ""reduced sugar"" or ""less sugar"" (a reduction of sugar by 25%), and ""no added sugar"" (no sugars added during processing).  Sugar Sweeteners  Sucrose and fructose, which are GRAS substances, are the primary sugar sweeteners that occur naturally in the food supply or are added as sugars, in corn sweeteners, or in syrups. These sweeteners add functional properties to foods through their effects on sensory (eg, flavor of molasses), physical (eg, crystallization, viscosity), microbial (eg, preservation, fermentation), and chemical (eg, carmelization, antioxidation) characteristics (7).  They all provide a similar amount of energy except in the cases of rare genetic abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism (eg, galactosemia, inherited fructose intolerance). The metabolism of human beings does not distinguish between energy provided from natural and refined sugars.  Although some unrefined nutritive sweeteners provide minerals (eg, molasses contains calcium, iron, magnesium, and potassium), the amount per tablespoon is relatively small compared to the Dietary Reference Intakes (8). Thus, consumers should base their selection of sugar sweeteners on sensory or functional properties, not on misconceptions of differences in nutrient value.  Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose and provides 4 kcal/g (approximately 16 kcal/tsp). Total sucrose intake ranges from 14 to 60 g/day or from 7% to 11% of energy intake (4). Commercially, sucrose comes from processing sugar cane or sugar beets. Refinement removes the yellow-brown pigments of unrefined sugar to produce the white crystal form of table sugar. Molasses is the least refined form of sucrose.  The monosaccharide fructose provides 4 kcal/g. Fructose is a component of sucrose, is present in fruit (also known as fruit sugar or levulose), and is added to foods and beverages as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or in the crystalline form. Fructose is manufactured through the isomerization of dextrose in corn starch.  Fructose has replaced sucrose in many foods and beverages because of its sweetening power and functional properties that enhance flavor, color, and product stability (9). Fructose also synergizes the sweetness potential of sucrose and other nonnutritive sweeteners (9).  Food consumption surveys show an increase in fructose consumption: the ratio of fructose intake as a proportion of total sugars has increased by nearly 30% from the 1977-1978 and 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys (4,9).  High intakes of fructose have implications for gastrointestinal health, blood glucose control, and lipid metabolism. Fructose is primarily absorbed from the gut by facilitated diffusion (10). Persons vary in their abilities to absorb fructose--some experience symptoms of malabsorption with a 20- to 50-g load (11). (A 12-oz sweetened soda or fruit drink has between 14 and 22 g fructose; 1 c apple juice has 14 g fructose.)  Some of the malabsorption of fructose-containing products may be the result of other nutritive sweeteners that are poorly absorbed (eg, sugar alcohols in apple juice). Fructose is better absorbed when consumed in sucrose (10), than in products where the amount of free fructose exceeds the amount of glucose (eg, in honey, prunes, apples and juice, HFCS, or crystalline fructose) (11).  Because of the method of absorption, fructose intake may lead to a slower rise in blood glucose than sucrose-based sweeteners. This fact, along with rapid clearance of fructose from blood serum, may improve glycemic control (12). High intakes of fructose could, theoretically, increase production of lipid precursors and increase the risk of hypertriglyceridemia.  However, this effect is not consistently seen, even in those who are at high risk of elevated plasma triglycerides (13).  The US Food Guide Pyramid (14) encourages consumers to have the smallest proportion of their energy derived from fats, oils, and sugars. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (15) urge consumers to choose a diet moderate in these sources of energy because excessive intake may provide the body with unnecessary energy and few nutrients. However, persons can include sugars in their diets and still consume a healthful diet.  A recent review of intake surveys from both the United States and the European Union showed no consistent or nutritionally meaningful variation in micronutrient intake across the range of sugar intakes (5). The association between sugar intake and nutrient adequacy of the diet has a U shape, suggesting that extreme intakes of sugar (too high or too low) are not optimal.  Persons show adequate nutrient intake across a wide range of sugar intakes (16). Those consuming low amounts of total sugar (less than 26.4 g/1,000 kcal) (17) tended to consume more energy from fat.  Polyols (Sugar Alcohols)  Polyols can also be categorized as sugar replacers (18) because they can replace sugar sweeteners, usually on a one-to-one basis; offer less energy; and offer potential health benefits (eg, reduced glycemic response and reduced dental caries risk). The polyols sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol are found in plant products such as fruits and berries. Commercially, these sweeteners are synthesized and not extracted from natural sources.  All polyols are absorbed slowly and incompletely from the intestine by passive diffusion. Therefore, an excessive load (eg, greater than 50 g sorbitol per day,greater than 20 g mannitol per day) may cause diarrhea. If polyols were completely absorbed, direct metabolism could provide the usual 4 kcal/g.  However, incomplete absorption causes indirect metabolism of polyols via fermentive degradation by the intestinal flora. The energy return from indirect metabolism is less than the direct route; thus, polyols are referred to as reduced-energy or low-energy sweeteners. FDA allows these nutritive sweeteners to be labeled as having fewer kilocalories per gram than other nutritive sweeteners. (See the Table for kilocalories per gram for eachpolyol.)  The safety and use of polyols has been extensively reviewed (19,20). Because of the incomplete absorption, polyols produce a low glycemic response. Products with sorbitol and mannitol may have the following statement on the label because high intakes increase the risk of malabsorption: ""excess consumption may have a laxative effect.""  Sorbitol is on the GRAS list for use in candies, chewing gum, jams/jellies, baked goods, and frozen confections. Mannitol is permitted for use on an interim basis pending further study of health effects. The interim status is provided to food additives that have a history of use but their safety has been brought into question by new information, even if it is not conclusive (21).  Mannitol is used as a dusting agent for chewing gum and a bulking agent in powdered foods. Xylitol is approved as a GRAS food additive for use in chewing gums, candies, pharmaceuticals, and hygiene products. A petition for GRAS status has been accepted for filing by FDA for isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH), and erythritol. These polyols are used in confections and/or as bulking agents.  Nonnutritive Sweeteners   The United States leads the world in consumption of high-intensity sweeteners, consuming approximately 50% of the world demand (22). High-intensity sweeteners can offer consumers a way to enjoy the taste of sweetness with little or no energy intake or glycemic response. Nonnutritive sweeteners may assist in weight management, control of blood glucose, and prevention of dental caries.  The food industry evaluates these sweeteners for many attributes, including sensory qualities (eg, clean sweet taste, no bitterness, odorless), safety, compatibility with other food ingredients, and stability in different food environments. The trend in the food industry is to blend high-intensity sweeteners.  Blending can cause sweetness synergy (ie, the combination is sweeter than the individual components), which can decrease the amount of sweetener needed and can improve the overall sweet taste.  FDA has approved 4 nonnutritive sweeteners and regulates them as food additives: saccharin (on an interim basis pending additional study), aspartame, acesulfame potassium (or acesulfame-K), andsucralose.  Saccharin  Saccharin exceeds the sweetness of sugar 200 to 700 times (23). It provides no energy, as it is not metabolized by human beings (23), and it is not cariogenic. The FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition estimates the daily use of saccharin at 50 mg per person per day.  The JECFA has set the ADI for saccharin at 5 mg/kg body weight per day (24). Despite the decline in use, saccharin is the largest-volume, lowest-cost high-intensity sweetener used in the world (nearly 62 million lb were used in 1995) (22). It is approved for use in more than 100 countries.  Saccharin was originally included on the GRAS listing. In 1977, FDA placed a ban on use of saccharin because it was reported to be a carcinogen in rats. In the same year, Congress, through the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act, imposed an 18- month moratorium on the FDA ban and required products containing saccharin to bear the following warning: ""Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.""  Congress has extended this moratorium 7 times, the last to continue through May 2002. In 1991, FDA formally withdrew the proposed ban and considers saccharin to be a food additive on an interim basis for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foods and beverages, tabletop sugar substitutes, and chewing gum.  The amount of saccharin must appear on the food label and is limited to no more than 12 mg/oz in beverages, 20 mg per sweetening equivalent of 1 tsp sugar, or no more than 30 mg per food serving (21).  Since 1981, saccharin has been listed as an ""anticipated"" human carcinogen (25). Studies of high users (ie, persons with diabetes) do not support an association between saccharin and cancer (26,27). However, subgroups of persons (eg, male heavy smokers) may present increased risk (25).  The advisory board for the National Toxicology Program did not recommend removal of saccharin from the Report on Carcinogens, Ninth Edition (report in preparation).  Aspartame  Aspartame a dipeptide (methyl ester of l-aspartic acid and l-phenylalanine) is 160 to 220 times sweeter than sucrose. Intestinal esterases hydrolyze aspartame to aspartic acid, methanol, and phenylalanine (28). The amino acids are metabolized to provide 4 kcal/g. Thus, this sweetener does provide energy; however, because of the intense sweetness of aspartame, the amount of energy derived from it is negligible.  In 1981, FDA approved aspartame as a sweetener for a number of dry uses (eg, tabletop sweetener, cold breakfast cereal, gelatins, puddings) and in chewing gum and carbonated beverages. In 1985, the Council on Scientific Affairs of The American Medical Association concluded that ""Available evidence suggests that consumption of aspartame by normal humans is safe and is not associated with serious adverse health effects"" (29, p 400).  FDA has evaluated aspartame use in food and beverages 26 times since its original approval. In 1996, FDA approved aspartame as a general-purpose sweetener for use in all foods and beverages. Aspartame is also approved for use in more than 100 nations.  Demand for aspartame in the United States rose from 8.4 million lb in 1986 to 17.5 million lb in 1992, a figure that represents more than 80% of the world demand. Although soft drinks account for more than 70% of aspartame consumption, this sweetener is added to more than 6,000 foods, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.  Aspartame is available in liquid, granular, encapsulated, and powder forms to extend its use in food and beverage products. The encapsulated form has made aspartame more heat stable and has extended its use in some commercially baked products.  Detailed studies have been conducted to determine how ingestion influences plasma levels of aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol (or the by-product formate). In studies of healthy adults (30), a bolus load (up to 200 mg/kg) did not alter levels of plasma aspartate concentrations or blood levels of formate. Plasma phenylalanine response to aspartame varies genetically.  Persons with phenylketonuria, a homozygous recessive inborn error of metabolism, are unable to metabolize phenylalanine. In persons with this rare (frequency is approximately 1 in 10,000 whites) inborn error, excess intake of this amino acid causes higher plasma levels and altered synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters (31) and adverse effects (32).  Thus, medical nutrition therapy for phenylketonuria involves the control of dietary sources of phenylalanine, including aspartame. Foods containing aspartame must, by FDA requirements, contain a label indicating that they contain phenylalanine.  Persons with phenylketonuria appear to tolerate the amount of phenylalanine in diet soda sweetened with aspartame (approximately 104 mg/12 oz) (33). Heterozygotes for phenylketonuria do not show changes in cognitive performance or in electroencephalograms after 12 weeks of consuming either 15 or 45 mg/kg aspartame per day (34).  In persons without phenylketonuria, single bolus studies of aspartame (up to 50 mg/kg body weight) or repeat dose studies show a plasma phenylalanine response near the normal postprandial range and considerably lower than that observed in persons with phenylketonuria or those with mild hyperphenylalanemia (30).  Aspartame breaks down to diketopiperazine in liquid systems with heat exposure and loses it sweetness. Animal toxicity studies show that even if all aspartame was converted to diketopiperazine in beverages, the amount would be well below the ADI of 3,000 mg/kg for diketopiperazine (35).  Some persons report allergic reactions to aspartame, including edema of the lips, tongue, and throat; dermatologic reactions; and respiratory problems (36). However, 2 double- blind challenge studies report difficulty recruiting persons who claim an allergic response to aspartame and failure to reproduce the allergic reaction in controlled experiment conditions (37,38).  FDA increased ADI for aspartame to its current level of 50 mg/kg body weight when it was approved for use in carbonated beverages. Post market assessment of aspartame shows that estimated daily intake of aspartame is below this ADI (39): aspartame eaters (at least 90th percentile of consumption) in the general population consume 6% of the ADI (3.0 mg/kg per day) and those aged 1 to 5 years consume 10.4% of the ADI (5.2 mg/kg per day).  Food labels can help consumers identify foods and beverages that contain aspartame, although the amount is not generally labeled. Consumers would need to contact the companies to determine the amount of aspartame in each product. Nonetheless, the amount in some common foods is: up to 225 mg in a 12-oz diet soda, 100 mg in an 8-oz drink made from powder, 80 mg in an 8-oz yogurt or a 4-oz gelatin dessert, up to 32 mg in 3/4 c sweetened cereal, and up to 47 mg in 1/2 c frozen dairy dessert.  As a tabletop sweetener, packets contain 37 mg aspartame and are equivalent to the sweetness of 2 tsp sugar. In the granular form, 1 tsp contains 16 mg aspartame and equals the sweetening of 1 tsp sugar. To reach the ADI, an 18 kg (nearly 40 lb) child would need to consume 900 mg aspartame per day, which translates to 24 packets of sweetener (equivalent to 48 tsp sugar), four 12-oz cans of diet soda, or nine 8-oz glasses of fruit drink made from a powder.  Acesulfame-K  Acesulfame-K (5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide) is approximately 200 times sweeter than sucrose. The ""K"" refers to potassium. Acesulfame-K can withstand high cooking/baking temperatures. Blends of acesulfame-K with other nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners can synergize the sweetness potential and decrease the bitter taste. This sweetener does not provide any energy; it is not metabolized by the body and is excreted in the urine unchanged.  This sweetener was evaluated for safety by JECFA in 1983 (40,41). FDA approved acesulfame-K in 1988. Both regulatory groups have set an ADI of 15 mg/kg body weight. In the United States, acesulfame-K is approved for use as a tabletop sweetener and as an additive in chewing gum, confections, desserts, yogurt, sauces, and alcoholic beverages (21).  FDA is reviewing acesulfame-K for use in nonalcoholic beverages. The tabletop sweetener contains approximately 0.4 g acesulfame-K per packet. The amount of acesulfame-K added to food products is very small because of its intense sweetening power and because it is often used in combination with other sweeteners.  Sucralose  Sucralose (trichlorogalactosucrose) is 600 times sweeter than sucrose. Sucralose provides no energy; it is not well absorbed and is excreted in the urine essentially unchanged. This sweetener is heat stable in cooking and baking.  Sucralose was approved in April 1998 as a tabletop sweetener and for use in a number of desserts, confections, and nonalcoholic beverages. FDA concluded from a review of more than 110 studies in human beings and animals that this sweetener did not pose carcinogenic, reproductive, or neurologic risk to human beings. In 1990, JECFA increased the temporary ADI from 0 to 3.5 mg/kg body weight to 0 to 15 mg/kg body weight (42).  Nonnutritive Sweeteners Not Yet Approved In The United States   Alitame  A petition for alitame as a tabletop sweetener and for use in a range of products including baked goods, beverages, and confections was submitted to FDA in 1986. Alitame is composed of l-aspartic acid, d-alanine, and a novel C-terminal amide moiety and is 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose without the bitter or metallic qualities of high-intensity sweeteners (43).  This sweetener blends with other high-intensity sweeteners to maximize the quality of sweetness. From an oral load of alitame, 7% to 22% is unabsorbed and excreted in the feces. The remaining amount (78% to 93%) is hydrolyzed to aspartic acid and alanine amide.  The aspartic acid is metabolized normally and the alanine amide is excreted in the urine as a sulfoxide isomer, sulfone, or conjugated with glucuronic acid. The incomplete absorption and metabolism results in a core value of 1.4 kcal/g.  In 1995, JEFCA concluded that alitame was not carcinogenic and did not show reproductive toxicity (44). However, recommendations on an ADI await further research on its safety. In the FDA petition, the estimated daily intake is 0.34 mg/kg body weight, which represents the amount if alitame was used as the only sweetener in a person's diet.  The level at which no observed adverse effects occurred in animals was 100 mg/kg (43). Alitame is approved for use in food and beverages in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the People's Republic of China.  Cyclamate  FDA banned this sweetener as a food ingredient in 1969 because the saccharin/cyclamate mixture was shown to cause cancer in laboratory mice (45). The primary concern was that it could be carcinogenic to some persons who appear to metabolize cyclamate to cyclohexylamine (46). To support a petition for use of cyclamate in 1982, the Cancer Assessment Committee of FDA reviewed the scientific evidence and concluded that cyclamate was not carcinogenic.  This was reaffirmed in 1985 by the National Academy of Sciences (47). The petition to reapprove cyclamate in the United States is still under review by FDA. This sweetener is more than 30 times sweeter than sucrose and is approved for use by more than 50 countries.  Sweetener Use In Segments Of The Population   Children  Because of their size and relatively high food and fluid intakes compared with adults, children will have the highest intake of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners as calculated by milligram intake per kilogram body weight. Children can safely consume nutritive sweeteners within a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines.  Children have shown a substantial increase in intake of fructose, presumably through intake of sweetened drinks and fruit drinks (5). Healthy young children (aged 6 to 18 months) can exhibit carbohydrate malabsorption (eg, fructose and sorbitol) with ingestion of common fruit juices (eg, apple juice) (48). (One cup apple juice can contain 14 g fructose and 2.5 g sorbitol.)  Children who exhibit nonspecific diarrhea may benefit from a reduction in fructose and products containing polyols.  It has been suggested that caregivers may want to limit intake of saccharin by young children because of the limited amount of data available for its use in children (49). The estimated daily intake of aspartame in children ranges from 8 to 17 mg/kg body weight in children aged 2 to 5 years, which is below the acceptable daily intake of 50 mg/kg body weight. Intakes of acesulfame-K in children are also below ADI (ranges from 3 to 9 mg/kg body weight).  Pregnant Women  Use of nutritive sweeteners that have GRAS status is acceptable during pregnancy. Recommendations for nonnutritive sweetener use during pregnancy must be based on well-designed and approved clinical investigations to ensure a healthy pregnancy and healthy babies. Saccharin can cross the placenta and may remain in fetal tissues because of slow fetal clearance (50). It has been suggested that women consider careful use of saccharin during pregnancy (49).  The issue with aspartame in pregnancy relates to fetal exposure to aspartic acid, phenylalanine, or methanol. In animals, an aspartame load does not change fetal exposure to aspartic acid (51). Fetal circulation levels of phenylalanine exceed maternal levels because of concentration across the placental barrier (52).  A bolus of aspartame (34 mg/kg or the 99th percentile of estimated daily intake) results in a peak plasma level of phenylalanine in normal subjects (112 micromol/L)1 and phenylketonuric heterozygotes (162 micromol/L) below the level that would cause neurological problems in the fetus (1,090 micromol/L) (53).  Plasma response of methanol and formate were not significant after an aspartame load. Thus, if placental transport of these compounds occurs, the amount is not clinically harmful (54). Use of aspartame within FDA guidelines appears safe for pregnant women.  Safety of acesulfame-K use during pregnancy has been determined with rat studies. (JECFA has determined that rats are an appropriate model for human beings.) At high levels (3% of the diet), there was no change observed in fertility, size of litter, body weight, growth, or mortality (55). Thus, use of acesulfame-K within FDA guidelines appears safe for pregnant women.  1 To convert micromol/L phenylalanine to mg/dL, multiply micromol/L by 0.01652. To convert mg/dL phenylalanine to micromol/L, multiply mg/dL by 60.54. Phenylalanine of 300 micromol/L=4.96 mg/dL.  Sweetener Use In Chronic Conditions   Behavioral Disorders  Claims of an association between sugar and hyperactivity have not been supported (56), even in those children who, by report, are sensitive to sugar (57). In fact, some research supports that persons with negative mood states (eg, seasonal affective disorders, alcohol withdrawal) should consume carbohydrate-rich foods, including sweets, as a way of alleviating their condition (58).  The mechanism by which carbohydrate, including sugars, may affect mood is not certain, but may involve the synthesis and release of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin controls functions such as temperature regulation, sensory perception, onset of sleep, and appetite. Control of brain levels of serotonin is of current interest for the management of depression, mood disorders, and appetite.  The alleged association between hyperactivity and aspartame is not scientifically supported (56,57). Some consumers report behavioral side-effects of aspartame (eg, headache, dizziness, mood alteration) related to the central nervous system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed 600 of these behavior complaints and concluded that there was no association (59).  Controlled clinical studies do not show an association between aspartame intake and seizures in sensitive children (60) or difficulties with cognitive and behavioral tasks in children with attention deficit disorder (61).  The association claimed between aspartame intake and risk of brain tumors has not been supported. A recent report hypothesized that aspartame use since its approval in 1981 had contributed to an increased incidence of brain tumors (61,62). However, FDA, using data from an analysis of the National Cancer Institute's database on cancer incidence in the United States (63), found a flattening of the rate of brain cancer since 1985 with a slight decrease from 1991 to 1993.  With consideration of these findings with other data reviewed at the time of approval, FDA continues to support the original approval of aspartame.  Dental Caries  Risk of dental caries increases with intake of nutritive sugars, however, this risk does not work independently from factors such as oral hygiene and fluoridation (64). Use of polyol-based gum can reduce the risk of dental caries compared to sucrose-sweetened gum, with the greatest benefit from xylitol-based gums (65).  FDA authorizes use of the health claim in food labeling that sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol) do not promote tooth decay (66). Nonnutritive sweeteners do not promote dental caries.  Diabetes Mellitus  The primary goal for disease management in persons with diabetes mellitus is to maintain near-normal blood glucose levels. Nutritive sweeteners do not produce greater increase in blood glucose response than complex starches, as was previously believed (67). Intake as high as 60 g fructose or sucrose per day may not adversely affect glycemic or lipid response in persons with type 2 diabetes (68).  Although it is recognized that carbohydrate sources provide different glycemic responses, the clinical perspective is that attention should be given first to the total amount of carbohydrate consumed rather than the source of carbohydrate (69).  The selection of healthful foods within the context of the Food Guide Pyramid and with attention to energy intake and blood glucose control is recommended for the management of diabetes (69).  Nonnutritive sweeteners are also appropriate in meal plans for persons with diabetes and may help control of energy intake. Dietetics practitioners can help persons with diabetes incorporate nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners into their individual meal plans.  Hyperlipidemia  Usual intakes of sucrose or fructose do not elevate plasma triglycerides in most persons, including those with diabetes, provided that energy balance is unchanged (13). However, very high intakes of dietary fructose and sucrose (approximately 2 to 3 times usual consumption) can result in elevations of plasma triglycerides (12). At this time there is no evidence that current levels of fructose intake contribute tohyperlipidemia.  Obesity  Excess body fat (obesity) arises from the energy imbalance caused by taking in too much energy and using too little. Perhaps because sugar adds hedonic value to many foods and beverages it has been hypothesized that sugar plays a major role in the etiology of obesity. There are several arguments against this hypothesis. First, sugars suppress appetite to the same extent as other carbohydrates (4).  Second, there is no relationship between the per capita amount of sugar available in the food supply and the incidence of obesity in the population (70). Third, epidemiologic studies show an inverse relationship between sugar intake and obesity (71) and a direct relationship between obesity and fat intake (72) and the ratio of fat to sugar in the diet (16). Obesity is a complex problem and its cause cannot be simply attributed to any 1 component of the food supply.  The contribution of nonnutritive sweeteners to obesity management is unclear. The original motivation for their development was based on the goal of providing a sweet taste without added energy to persons with diabetes and those wanting to control energy intake. Nonnutritive sweeteners can save the consumer up to 16 kcal/tsp sweetening.  Theoretically, if total intake of sugars (estimated at 95 g or approximately 24 tsp/day) were replaced by nonnutritive sweeteners, this could result in a deficit of 380 kcal/day or a 1 lb weight loss in 9 to 10 days. One study has shown that the addition of aspartame- sweetened foods and beverages to a multidisciplinary weight-control program facilitated long-term maintenance of reduction in body weight in obese women (73).  However, obesity prevalence has increased substantially at the same time as the consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners has increased. The rise in prevalence clearly relates to all factors that cause an energy imbalance.  Therefore, persons who wish to lose weight may choose to use nonnutritive sweeteners but should do so within the context of a sensible weight management program including a sensible diet and enjoyable exercise.  Implications For Dietetics Professionals   Sweetness can add pleasure to eating, and today consumers can enjoy a wide range of sweeteners in a wide variety of foods and beverages. Both food labeling and the range of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners allow choice in the type and amount of sweeteners to include in the diet.  Consumers can incorporate nutritive sweeteners into a healthful eating plan and meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The food label also provides information to consumers on types and amounts of nutritive sweeteners in food and beverages.  Nonnutritive sweeteners are safe for use by most persons within the approved guidelines. The trend in sweetener blending will maximize sweetener potential and help to support intakes of nonnutritive sweeteners well within the acceptable levels. As new nonnutritive sweeteners emerge, the safety of these substitutes used alone or in combination with other nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners and macronutrient substitutes, such as fat replacers, will need to be examined.  Additionally, national surveillance of intake of both nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners is important to determine if they help consumers meet the recommended dietary goals.

Hungry, Hungry Hormones - Part 2.
The peripheral effects of Leptin include interactions with many hormones of the body as well as interactions with the skeletal muscle, the immune system, and the reproductive system...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/berardi58.htm,"Express Yourself   As discussed last week in Part I, Leptin is a hormone produced when the OB (obesity) gene is expressed. While I've already discussed one mechanism to induce OB gene expression and Leptin production.  The Three Main Cellular Signals Involved Are: Increased energy/carbohydrate flux through the HBP.  Increased triacylglycerol (triglyceride) metabolites. These include diacylglycerols and/or free fatty acids.  Increased tension in adipose tissue due to cellular stretching (increases in adipose size).As you can see, these three phenomena provide response mechanisms whereby both acute and chronic overfeeding or underfeeding will influence OB gene expression and Leptin production. If overfeeding, more carbohydrates will flux through HBP, more triglycerides will be metabolized, and adipose tissue sizes will increase. This leads to more Leptin production. Conversely, if underfeeding, carbohydrate and triglyceride availability will be decreased, as will adipose tissue size. Of course, this means less Leptin. Since we now know why Leptin is formed, how about discussing where it's formed? In adult humans, most of the body's leptin is formed in white adipose tissue. This should be self-evident from the signals discussed above. However, Leptin has also been found in the following tissues, making it relatively ubiquitous.  Leptin Is Also Found In: Brown adipose tissue Gastric epithelium Placenta Skeletal muscle Mammary glands  Rats & Fat Loss   When Leptin was originally discovered, scientists found that rats that had mutations in the OB gene (and couldn't produce Leptin) became insanely obese. Now when I say obese, I'm not talking a little overweight here. I'm talking so obese that members of NAAFA actually pointed and laughed.    Healthy Obsessions.  We have choices to make about our weight and it is within our power to exercise these choices.  [ Click here to learn more. ] In the obese rats, the extreme obesity was caused by mutations in the Ob gene. In these animals, there was simply too little Leptin. Interestingly, when administered Leptin, these tubby rats saw big increases in metabolic rate and lost massive amounts of body fat.  As a result of these findings, researchers speculated that Leptin might be a magical fat loss hormone.  Unfortunately for the pharmaceutical companies who immediately jumped all over the rights to sell recombinant Leptin, this hypothesis didn't pan out. You see, another model of rat was discovered, a model that was as obese as the Leptin deficient rats but had adequate Leptin concentrations in the blood. These rats, instead of a Leptin deficiency, had problems with their Leptin receptor. Therefore the Leptin that was present couldn't do its job. In addition to this new rodent data, thwarting the potential billions to be gained from Leptin sales, new human data also showed that Leptin was unlikely to help the obese drop those few hundred unwanted pounds.  Research Had Clearly Demonstrated That: Very few obese humans actually suffer from Ob gene mutations Very few obese humans actually suffer from Leptin receptor mutations Obese humans often have very high concentrations of leptin in the plasmaSince obese humans often have so much Leptin, research has been directed toward how these individuals can have so much Leptin, yet fail to respond with a reduction in body weight, as did our furry rodent friends. One hypothesis that has gained popularity suggests that a Leptin resistance causes human obesity.  In other words, the very obese got this way because they were somehow intolerant to rising Leptin. As one researcher put it, ""Leptin resistance is not well defined, however this term is usually used to mean that leptin does not perform its central and peripheral functions."" At this point, there is some evidence for the Leptin resistance hypothesis. Since Leptin seems to have central effects, the saturable blood brain barrier transport system for leptin may be linked to obesity. Since obese humans have a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) to plasma ratio that is much lower than normal-sized humans, it appears that only so much Leptin can get across the BBB into the brain.  In addition, in rats, dietary induced obesity (DIO) is accompanied by high plasma leptin concentrations. This leptin doesn't seem to prevent the obesity. However, when administered intracerebroventricular leptin (leptin into the brain), they lose weight, indicating a potential BBB transport limit. Although these data offer support to the idea that there is a limit to amount of leptin allowed into the brain and therefore a type of Leptin ""resistance"" exists at the higher levels of Leptin production, some authors believe that leptin resistance is actually a misnomer.  These researchers are of the opinion that since leptin may not be designed to function in such high concentrations as seen in obesity, Leptin may be more important in its absence than its presence (i.e. may be more important in calorie restriction and not in calorie excess, as is often seen with obesity).  In other words, it's not that the obese are ""improperly"" responding to their leptin. Instead, these authors are suggesting that the obese aren't ""supposed"" to have so much leptin and therefore don't respond to it's elevation above a certain point.   What Does Leptin Do?   The hormone Leptin seems to affect nearly every system of the body. Since there are Leptin receptors in the brain and throughout the body, we can discuss the effects of Leptin as central or peripheral.  Since Leptin is released (mostly) by adipose tissues, adipose tissue seems to be a peripheral static indicator of the chronic energy balance of the body. Once released into the blood, under normal conditions, Leptin travels across the blood brain barrier and is sensed by the Leptin receptors in the hypothalamus.  Since these receptors have some idea of what's a ""normal"" Leptin signal, changes in Leptin binding initiates the release of a series of anabolic (orexigenic or meal stimulating) and catabolic (anorexigenic or meal preventing) hormones/neurotransmitters. An increase in leptin leads to the expression of several anorexigenic (catabolic) hormones and neurotransmitters including MSH and CART. These chemicals decrease hunger and meal size. Conversely, a decrease in leptin leads to the expression of several orexigenic (anabolic) hormones and neurotransmitters including NPY and AgRP. These compounds increase hunger and meal size. This is a rather nice way for the body to deal with energy surplus or energy deficit. If there's a surplus, Leptin increases, signaling the hypothalamus to tell the body to stop eating.  Conversely, if there's a deficit, Leptin decreases, signaling the hypothalamus to make us really hungry. For you visual learners, here's a visual depiction of what happens when Leptin concentrations increase in the hypothalamus.  Click to view large version. Although I only mentioned a couple key orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones/neurotransmitters, there are many others that can interact with Leptin or the same signaling systems as Leptin. These are listed below:          Orexigenic        (stimulate food intake) - May act in the lateral hypothalamic neurons        Anorexigenic        (reduce food intake) - May act on the ventral & dorsal medial hypothalamusNeuropeptide Y (NPY) - is the most potent orexiant known; may respond to aberrant leptin signaling; antagonism may reduce hunger and fat massPro-Opiomelanocortin (POMC) - precursor to MSHAgouti Related Peptide (AgRP) - potent orexiant; may respond to absent leptin; antagonism may reduce hunger and fat massMelanocyte Stimulating Hormone (MSH) - decreases food intake; may respond to increased leptin; antagonism increases appetite and foodMelanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH) - receives signals from NPY to increase food intakeMelanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) - MSH receptor; binding of agonist reduces food intakeOrexin - increases arousal and food intakeCocaine Amphetamine Related Transcript (CART) - decreases food intake; may respond to increased leptinGhrelin - a potent GH releasing hormone released from the stomach, pituitary, and hypothalamus; increases food intake and body weight; may compete with leptinCCK - gastric released peptide; increases satiety; reduces food intake (single feeding and meal frequencyCorticotropin releasing factor (CRF) - regulates adrenal hormones and ACTH; decreases food intake, increases energy expenditureInsulin - increasing concentrations of insulin decrease appetite While these energy regulating hormones and neurotransmitters may be relatively new to you, the important message here is that they are responsible for sensing a starvation response (with decreased Leptin).  In Response To These Decreases In Leptin Concentrations, These Chemicals Are Responsible For Promoting The Following Effects: Increased food intake Decreased skeletal muscle growth Decreased energy expenditure Decreased body temperature Decreased reproductive function Increased adrenal production of stress hormones Increased parasympathetic toneConversely, these energy regulating hormones and neurotransmitters are responsible for sensing an energy surplus (with increased Leptin).  Therefore, When Leptin Concentrations Increase, The Following Effects Are Promoted: Decreased food intake Increased energy expenditure Increased sympathetic toneAgain, for you visual kids, here's a schematic. Remember, Leptin is regulated in response to acute feeding as well as chronic energy balance (as measured by adipose mass). Therefore, while you'll see weight gain and weight loss as regulators below, you could replace these terms with underfeeding and overfeeding.  Click to view large version. Notice that the main discussion today has centered on the central effects of Leptin (in the hypothalamus). However, Leptin, as discussed earlier, also has a number of peripheral effects.  The Peripheral Effects Include The Following: In skeletal muscle, leptin increases fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity, explaining part of its effect on weight reduction.  Leptin may act in concert with the immune system since leptin deficient animals have reduced immunity. This may explain part of the effect of dieting on weakened immune function.  Leptin may play a permissive role in female menarche since there is an inverse relationship between Leptin concentrations and age of first menstruation. This means girls with more body fat (and higher Leptin concentrations) may have first menstruation sooner than leaner girls.  Leptin concentrations and Testosterone concentrations are inversely proportional through the normal range of Testosterone. This means that as Leptin goes up, Testosterone down. Conversely, as Leptin goes down, Testosterone goes up. This should be no surprise as very overweight men are often hypogonadal. However, you should wonder why those who are extremely lean are often hypogonadal as well.  The paradox of this relationship is that leptin is partly responsible for increasing GnRH secretion as well as LH, FSH, and Testosterone secretion. Therefore, at very low concentrations there would be an occurrence of hypogonadism. But very high concentrations, Leptin directly inhibits Testosterone release (leptin decreases T secretion from testis, even in spite of increased GnRH activity), again causing hypogonadism.  Therefore the best Leptin concentrations would be at the low normal range. Not coincidentally, this usually occurs in those lean individuals who are well fed. In Addition To These Peripheral Effects, Leptin Has Shown The Following Interactions With Other Hormones:   Leptin increases GnRH at hypothalamus Leptin decreases Testosterone at testis Glucocorticoids increase plasma leptin SNS activity (epinephrine) decreases plasma leptin Testosterone decreases plasma leptin Insulin acts with leptin by stimulating the same neuronal populations Insulin increases Ob gene expression Ghrelin competes with leptin centrally, with opposite actions as leptin Leptin and insulin sensitize the hindbrain to the anorexigenic hormone CCK The Following Adipocytokines (hormones released from adipose) May Also Interact With Leptin:  ResistinAdipocytokine that may regulate insulin sensitivity AdiponectinEnhances insulin function Increases with insulin and decreases with obesity Increases UCP2 in muscle Increases fatty acid transporter protein Increases acyl CoA oxidase Decreases triglyceride content in liver and muscle AdipsinIs found in proportion to adiposity Is required for the synthesis of ASP (acylation stimulating protein  is involved in the uptake and esterification of TAG and FA) Stimulates TAG synthesis more than insulin  Conclusion   What's that sound? Oh, that's the bell! Quickly I'd like to recap this week's lesson. First of all, Leptin is released from many peripheral tissues but the biggest player is white adipose. Once released, Leptin has all kinds of divergent effects on the peripheral systems of the body, many of which are just coming to light. These peripheral effects include interactions with many hormones of the body as well as interactions with the skeletal muscle, the immune system, and the reproductive system. Also, Leptin acts centrally in order to stir up a neurotransmitter soup of meal stimulating and meal reducing chemicals. These central and peripheral effects are important to understand as they are ultimately responsible for metabolic changes with feeding as well as weight gain and loss. So class is now dismissed for this week. But don't miss out on next week's lecture. I'll be reviewing some of the important feeding studies and discussing some recent data showing how recombinant Leptin injections may actually help prevent the metabolic decline associated with dieting.

Nicole Moneer's Guide To A Fit First Trimester
Physique competitors get to the pinnacle of their sport by taking precise control of their diet, training, and lifestyle. When she got pregnant, Nicole Moneer experienced a different kind of ""body building!""
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/nicole-moneer-guide-to-a-fit-first-trimester.html,"There I was at age 41a personal trainer, former IFBB bikini pro, and cardio kickboxing teacher, and I was out of breath climbing up the stairs! I needed to take it down a notch and rest, even though my head said go, go, go.Vital Stats Name: Nicole Moneer Location: Chicago, Illinois  Occupation: NASM Personal trainer, CHEK holistic lifestyle coach  Experience: Retired IFBB bikini pro, Team Bodybuilding.com sponsored athlete What happened? The same thing that's been happening to women since the dawn of time: I got pregnant! I didn't feel it all the time yet, but every day my body was sending me louder messages that I couldn't ignore. A lot of us in the fitness and health industry live constantly in the train-hard mode, but that has to change when you're pregnant. I was growing a little human, and I've never done that before! Most people say the first trimester is the hardest, and I found it to be true, if only because it's the trimester that's the most unique for every woman. The cravings, nausea, energy levels and emotionsdid I already mention the cravings?run the gamut! Here's how I adjusted my training, nutrition, and supplementation during this crucial time. I want to help you feel better and preserve as much of your fitness level as you can. You'll need it just a few months from now!Training During the First TrimesterIf you're already used to thinking in terms of 12-week stretches from following fitness plans like those on Bodybuilding.com, great. That's how long your first trimester is! And just like a 12-week transformation, there are some sleepless nights, hunger pains, and of course, the fear you're not doing it all exactly the way you had hoped to. Believe me, I experienced all of these. Of course, not all women train with weights while they're pregnant. Depending on your pregnancy and any complications you're experiencing, it may not even be an option for you. But it was for me, and that was a huge relief! My time in the weight room is important to me, both mentally and physically. My pregnancy never fully removed me from training, but I did make adjustments as my body and energy levels changed. Make no mistake, though: ""crushing it"" was no longer my highest priority. You hear a lot of people saying that you'll need to ""listen to your body"" during this time, but this doesn't necessarily mean ""Hey, I feel great, so I can push it harder today."" On the contrary, my body let me know when I needed to back off in intensity or skip an exercise entirely.   My time in the weight room is important to me, both mentally and physically. Here are some of the other modifications I found helpful: Instead of weight training 4-5 times per week, I started going 3-4, and eventually less.My rest days weren't active-rest days. Often, I was sleeping! For the first three months I went to bed between 6 and 8 p.m. and slept all the way through until about 8 a.m. That's more than what I'm used to, but it felt totally necessary! I avoided any exercise that required me to lie on my stomach, or which resulted in any pain or pulling on the midsection. This is a rule you'll hear from doctors and other experts. I lowered the amount of weight I liftedoften dramatically. Pregnant powerlifting is not a sport!Use seated variations. For certain exercises, it feels more comfortable to sit down on a chair, bench, or stability ball.I avoided hot yoga, which can damage a baby's organs in the first trimester. This had been a weekly ritual for me, so it was a tough change. Also off limits: saunas and hot tubs. Soreness from my exercise went up, so I doubled down on stretching and foam rolling. I teach Pilates with my clients, and I found that it helped me maintain my strength and flexibility. Prenatal yoga was also a great addition!As you can see, you have options. Explore them, and use them!When Cravings Attack I was in horrible health when I was younger. But today, I feel and look better at 41 than I did at 21, and a lot of that is because of how I eat. Since 2006, I've been committed to healthy eating: organic vegetables, healthy fats, and grass-fed antibiotic hormone-free protein sources. But during my first trimester, my body decided it wanted to go on a nutritional adventure and drag me kicking and screaming all the way! Everybody has a craving story. Here's mine. Before I knew I was pregnant, I felt extremely thirsty and was hungry all the time, but not for anything in particular. Then, all of a sudden, it got very particular. For instance, I'm a big greens fan, but I rarely eat fruit. Before I became pregnant, I ate different vegetables throughout the day. Then, all of a sudden, I could barely stomach green vegetables, and I craved mangoes, berries, grapefruit, apples, and pears constantly! I didn't have a dark leafy green salad for over two months, which was very alien to me.   I feel and look better at 41 than I did at 21, and a lot of that is because of how I eat. Then it got weirder. When I hit Week 7, I craved everything I had been rejecting for the last few years. ""Pizza and cake, now!"" was what my body was telling me, and I had no choice but to listen. I would even wake up in the middle of the night to eat. I had to wake up because I had this hole in my stomach! Trust me: The hunger pangs you get when you're pregnant are much different than when you're not. Experienced fitness competitors can go to bed hungry, wake up hungry, eat, and be fine. A pregnant woman can't go to bed hungry. I was scared that I would wake up and puke! The only times I threw up during my first trimester where when I went three hours without eating, in fact. I had to eat to feel comfortable, to even get to sleep.During the day, it felt like I was training for a marathon. I found myself eating hourly, sneaking in bites of something calorie-rich between client sessions to get me through. If I missed a window, I became nauseous and had a hard time focusing on work. But here's the big takeaway: The couple of weeks when I did eat like crapola, I didn't beat myself up for it. I've spent the last eight years cleaning up my nutrition and supplementation, so I was confident this was just a phase. And sure enough, when Week 10 hit, I wanted chicken and vegetables again. Thank God! Vitamins and SupplementsI'll be honest: I cut out most of my prepregnancy supplement stack after consulting with my midwife and nutritionist. But I also had my blood work done and discovered that there were a few areas I could still benefit from a little extra help with. Nicole's Prenatal SupplementsCod liver oilPrenatal vitamins CholineCalciumVitamin BVitamin DFor instance, my vitamin D was off the bottom of the charts. I supplemented with calcium and vitamin B and went on a whole-food prenatal vitamin made by New Chapter. I also took extra choline, since this nutrient is crucial for baby's development, particularly in the brain and central nervous system. I usually alternate between omega-3 capsules and liquid fish oil such as cod liver oil, which is more concentrated. I kept this up during my entire pregnancy, and I also tried to eat quality wild-caught fish that I felt confident was low in mercury. A little calcium and B-vitamins, and I was set!About the Weight Gain... In the first trimester I gained about 6-8 pounds. It's kind of amazing that's all I gained, considering how much I ate. But honestly, I wasn't freaking out about my weight. I knew I needed healthy weight to have a baby with healthy weight. I totally understand how people in this industry may freak out about weight gain, but I committed to enjoying the journey. This was my first pregnancy, and I wanted to experience it in all its bizarre, intense glory! I didn't think I could get pregnant, so it was a blessing from day one. I enjoyed learning more about my body, and I want everyone to know that even after all that we've learned about pregnancy, it's still a lot of trial and error.I took control where I could, but gave it up where it felt necessary. That's a life lesson we can all benefit from, pregnant or not!"

Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide - Part Two!
It still amazes me that there is a human growing inside of me. Since the last time I wrote I have found out that I am having a boy and I am thrilled. I am now 27 weeks pregnant and just beginning my third trimester. I will outline what I have been doing.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pregnancy1.htm,"Note: This is part two, click here for part one!  It still amazes me that there is a human growing inside of me. When you first get pregnant it takes a while for it to sink in and it is amazing to me how one being that I have not even met yet means so much to me. I am so attached already that I can not imagine what it will be like when I actually get to see him.  I realize now how important staying in shape is and how important it is to eat right. I hope that all of your pregnancies are going well and these articles have helped. Since the last time I wrote I have found out that I am having a boy and I am thrilled.  I grew up with all girls so it will definitely be something different! My first trimester was so slow for me but the second was so fast. I am now 27 weeks pregnant and just beginning my third trimester. I will outline what I have been doing and how you need to adapt to your ever changing body.   Exercise    Exercise wise I have been doing the same lifting plan as the first article. I still go light so there has been no problems for me there. Cardio has gotten a little harder for me and I have had to change my routine up a little. I used to do 45 minutes at a time and now I have cut it back to 30 minutes at a time.  With the 30 minutes I do one more day so I can still get some good cardio in. Remember your joints and ligaments are very loose now so injury can come a lot more easily. Just remember to take it slow and make sure you can carry on a conversation throughout your whole session.   Supplements    Supplement wise I am still the same also. The fish oil is the most important right now so if you have not been taking that I would get some right away.  It can really help the baby sleep through the night and improve his smarts! Calcium is being drained from you at a fast rate now so make sure you do not skimp on your calcium pills.  Your body can only absorb 500mg at a time so you will need to split up your doses. Your morning sickness should be over by now and so there is no excuse not to take your pre natals. If you have a problem with them making you sick try and split them up. I take one in the morning and the other one at night!   Diet    Weight gain can come more rapidly now and foods can be stored as fat a lot easier. I feel like it is all being stored as fat. =)  Just make sure you eat a balanced meal and eat small meals often. One thing that can help is by taking a little bit of protein with each meal. It helps digestion and that is so slow right now anything helps. Since digestion is so slow, heartburn can be a real problem.  Drinking lots of water can help this and TUMS is also okay to take. One thing that I like to do is get the ones with calcium so that way I make sure to get all the calcium I need!   Conclusion    This last leg of the pregnancy can really bring you down so you will want to do everything you can to make yourself feel better. The baby, I know mine like it, may use your ribs as punching bag and seem to sit on your bladder 24/7.  Your fatigue comes back now and so can morning sickness a little. Also the dreaded varicose veins can come in - YUCK! But exercise is the number one thing to prevent this. Exercise, diet and eating right can make this not so bad.

What do you think that's done for you?My life has not been a walk in the park. Not having key people in my life, like parents or a spouse, has made things a bit challenging. But, I feel that it's truly helped me grow as a person and athlete. I can function and do anything alone. I have no problems finishing things that I set my heart and mind to.Why did you enlist in the Marines?I enlisted in the USMC because at the time I did not have any sort of structure in my life. My older brother was an active-duty Marine and I saw how it was providing him choices and security that I didn't have.Looking back at the time I spent in the Marine Corps, there's no question that it provided me with lessons I will hold close for the rest of my life. Responsibilities an 18-year-old Marine has are far beyond those of what many people would have in a lifetime.Do you prefer performance fitness to physique fitness? What do you say to people who are more concerned about how they look than how they perform?My whole life has depended on how well I did things. I always had to perform or make things happen in my life just to survive. I played sports my whole life and I always wanted to be better than the day before. I would practice and drill the mechanics of the position or game I was training for.I started doing figure purely because of the results of the training I was doing. Once training became secondary and how I looked became the most important, I decided that figure was no longer my interest. I needed a competitive sport to fill the void.I really have no opinion for those who prefer to look strong and healthy rather than being strong and healthy. The only thing I would say from one fitness professional to another would be: ""Be honest with what you do to look a certain way. There are people who look up to you and, if you are setting unreachable goals, it can very much discourage them.""What are your goals for CrossFit?My CrossFit goals are to be the fittest me I can possibly be. I will be turning 30 in 10 months and plan to be in the best physical shape possible. I did the Open WODs and it was a great way to see where I was and how I compared to other athletes. I have a new plan and am working really hard to make it to Regionals next year.I will be competing at the Garage Games in Virginia Beach in August. I will also be running a half marathon soon and hope to run the Marine Corps Marathon in October.  // <![CDATA[var addthis_config = {data_use_flash: false}// ]]>"

Bodybuilding Can Decrease Your Risk Of Developing Type 2 Diabetes!
Type 2 diabetes doesn't appear overnight.  It takes time for it to develop which means you have time to take the necessary measures to halt its development in its tracks. Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/decrease_type_2_diabetes_risk.htm,"Article Summary: Type 2 diabetes has some controllable risk factors and others you can't. Physical activity and healthy diet are great measures to decrease risk. Decreasing your stress levels is recommended for decreasing your risk.  Bodybuilding Can Decrease Your Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes  Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Formerly known as Adult Onset Diabetes, type 2 diabetes typically strikes during adulthood. Though it used to be very uncommon for children to develop type 2 diabetes, our nation is seeing an alarming increase in the number of children who are being diagnosed with this disease. This rise, in both children and adults, coincides with the rise in obesity over the past several years.  Click To Enlarge.This Rise Coincides With The Rise In Obesity Over The Past Several Years. In type 2 diabetes, our body's cells become resistant to the hormone insulin which shuttles glucose (sugar) into our cells. When our body is resistant to insulin, and in the absence of medication, our blood sugar levels stay elevated. Over time, high blood sugar causes a number of complications including heart disease, kidney disease, eye problems, nerve damage, skin problems and circulation issues.   Causes   The most important thing to know is that type 2 diabetes is often preventable. Though some people have an increased propensity for developing this disease, if they take the proper measures, they can increase their chances of preventing it from ever occurring. Type 2 diabetes doesn't appear overnight. It takes time for it to develop which means you have time to take the necessary measures to halt its development in its tracks.   var title = ""Awesome Muscles Podcast Series""; //The title of the radio showvar URL = ""http://bodybuilding.com/fun/audio/am/awesome_muscles_podcast_29dec2005_3.mp3""; //The URL to the audio file (can be any type of audio file)var pictures = new Array();var pictureslinks = new Array(); pictures.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/images/2009/decrease_type_2_diabetes_risk_a.jpg""); //A URL to a picture to go on the rightpictureslinks.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/diabetespodcast.htm""); //A URL to the link of the picture on the right (if no link, leave bank or &quot;null&quot;) pictures.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/images/2009/decrease_type_2_diabetes_risk_b.jpg"");pictureslinks.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/gastelu.htm""); audioPlayer(URL,title,pictures,pictureslinks);   There are many contributing factors that can lead to the development of  type 2 diabetes. These include:   Excess Fat    Excess body fat, especially abdominal fat will increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The more fat you have packed on your body, the more your cells become resistant to   insulin.    In addition, the type of fat you eat and the size of your cells alters your cell membranes which house the receptor sites that insulin binds to. This would be like cutting a larger keyhole and expecting the same key (insulin) to open the door.  Inactivity    Physical activity helps control your weight and it uses up glucose in your bloodstream for energy so your body doesn't have to pump out as much insulin to bring that glucose into your cells. It also makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.    BODYBUILDING.COM FORUM: INACTIVITY THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ] Metabolism And Inactive Daily Life, I Need Advice.

As a bodybuilder you have this one covered. In fact, you are doing more than the minimum amount of exercise recommended to help decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You periodize your training to meet your goals and consistently challenge your body through strength training and aerobics.  3.

Stay In The Game With Kinesiology Tape
Today's top athletes sport more than just striations and badass tats on their skin; they're also covered in brightly colored strips of kinesiology tape. Here's what you need to know to tape like the pros!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/stay-in-the-game-with-kinesiology-tape.html,"Back in 2008 during the Summer Olympic Games, people who tuned in to the beach volleyball competition noticed something a little strange. What was that funny-looking colored tape that some of the athletes were wearing? What's in a name? The original Kinesio Tape was invented over 30 years ago in Japan by chiropractor Dr. Kenzo Kase. Today, there are several brands offering variations under the more general title of ""kinesiology tape,"" including the popular brands KT Tape and RockTape. Kinesiology is the scientific study of human movement. In this spirit, kinesiology taping allows much greater movement than more rigid traditional sports taping procedures.Sports care providers and elite athletes could have told you that what you were looking at was called kinesiology tape. They had been using it for decades, but almost no one else had. In the last few years, though, taping has definitely come down the mountain. Today, it's an increasingly common sight not only in team sports, but also in more general weight training, running, and cycling. You can buy high-quality tape in almost any sporting goods store or online, and you don't need to have a pro help you apply it. Sons can effectively tape up their dad's golfer's elbow before a weekend tourney. Friends tape each other's lower legs to help with shin splints or calf pain prior to running a 5k. CrossFit athletes apply the tape on their abs and lower backs during training and competitionbut so do pregnant women during the third trimester.Greatbut does it work? In my experience as a chiropractor who deals with plenty of athletes, it definitely does. The tape helps speed up the healing process while supporting injured tissues. It also allows athletes to train with minor muscle injuries while the healing process continues. If that sounds like what you need to stay off the sidelines, here's what you should know. WHAT DOES KINESIOLOGY TAPE DO?KT Tape: Elastic Sports Tape Doesn't Restrict Your Range of Motion, Comfortable to Wear! Get It Now!Kinesiology tape is designed to mimic human skin. When placed on a body part, it helps facilitate the body's natural healing process by lifting the skin away from the muscle fascia, creating space between the blood, lymph, and nerves. This improves circulation and reduces pressure on sensory and neural receptors, which reduces pain. This method of taping allows more movement than traditional athletic taping for injuries, which is more compressive and limits joint movement. Depending on who you ask, the benefits of kinesiology tape differ slightly. But overall, these are the main benefits people experience:Muscle and joint support to encourage correct movement and limit compensation due to injury.Pain relief through improved blood circulation and lymph drainage.Increased sensory stimulation through the skin, which can alleviate muscle weakness and reduce muscle pain.The most common injuries that can benefit from taping are wear-and-tear phenomena like strains, overuse injuries, and ligament pain. For more advanced injuries, start by meeting with a qualified health care provider and building a treatment program that is based on a personal examination and history. Once the injury has improved and proper instruction on taping has been given, you can try home taping.  When placed on a body part, kinesiology tape helps facilitate the body's natural healing process by lifting the skin away from the muscle fascia, creating space between the blood, lymph, and nerves. KNOW YOUR STRIPSA little bit of education goes a long way when it comes to kinesiology taping. Don't just slap a strip on and expect it to work for you. Specific applications and technique will differ according to what area you're treating and your desired goal. Start out by getting proficient with your tape provider's preferred technique. Once you've mastered the basics, you can experiment with some of the more complex arrangements you see on CrossFitters and other athletes. No matter the technique, though, it always starts with you making the base or anchor of the tape. This is achieved by tearing the backing so approximately two inches of tape is exposed. Place the two-inch portion down on the skin and rub the non-sticky side to help activate the adhesive.Don't place any stretch or tension on the base. From there, remove the rest of the backing and maneuver the rest of the tape into one of these four basic styles of application.I-StripI-stripUsing an I-strip is a good application for muscle injuries. Simply apply the strip directly over the muscle belly with minimal stretch. I also like to place a smaller strip perpendicular to the first strip lying directly over the injured area for additional support. Y-StripY-stripA Y-strip surrounds a muscle by using its two tails for support. It is commonly used on the calf, triceps, and shoulders, among other applications. Some tape companies sell pre-cut Y-strips, but you can easily make one by cutting down the middle of an I-strip. Once the base is laid down with no tension, apply the tails to or alongside a muscle. The tension on the tails should be equal. I use this applications a lot for neck and shoulder problems. X-StripX-stripYou can make an X-strip either by overlapping two strips or cutting a single strip. I like to use this application at the elbow, knee, and other delicate areas where having multiple points of support is helpful. When working around joints, try to keep equal tension on the tails.Fan StripFan stripThis application is used primarily for reducing edema, or swelling. It consists of a base with 4-5 thin strips. Depending on the body part, the strips are usually placed about a half-inch to an inch apart. A second strip can be place on the opposite side of the first base, and the strips can be placed in an overlapping fashion. This further helps with edema reduction. Athletes use fan strips all over the body, but some common applications include sprained ankles, plantar fasciitis, and on the abs or shoulders.These are just the start. If you watch the numerous instructional videos put out by tape manufacturers, you'll see all of these styles mixed in complex tape patterns. Mastering them will take practice, and often, a patient partner to learn with you. If you fear that you're not up to the task, seek out an experienced sports therapist or chiropractor in your area.8 RULES FOR EFFECTIVE KINESIOLOGY TAPINGCommon Questions Do the different colors have different benefits? No, aside from looking cool.  Does the tape have any medication on it? No.  Will it work for my painful [fill in the blank]? Maybe. Do research, experiment, and talk with your provider.    1   Buy the right tape for youTape can be purchased in two-inch rolls similar to standard athletic tape, and sometimes a four-inch strip for larger areas like the low back. If you're a trainer or coach who will use a lot of tape, you could invest in a range of tape precut into X, Y, and fan formations. The rest of us can simply cut I-strips into the shape we need. Each supplier has different varieties of tape to choose from.   2   Prep your skinI say this because I have sometimes not prepped the skin properly, and the tape didn't adhere firmly or came off too soon. Make sure the area of the skin to be treated is dry and free of oils, creams, and lotions. Also make sure that there is not excessive body hair. Applying tape to a hairy area will interfere with the adhesion. Get a trimmer and shave the area if necessary.   3   Tape stretch and tension are crucialMost applications require a certain amount of tension be placed on the tapetypically 0, 25, 50, or 100 percent. An easy way to understand this concept is to start by stretching the tape to maximum lengththat's 100 percent. If you back it down halfway, that's 50 percent, and another half-step down is 25 percent. Placing the tape on the body without stretch would be called no stretch or ""paper-off"" tension. Tension can also be achieved by stretching the body part, then taping it in the stretched position. All of these techniques have their uses, and sometimes a guide will have you mix them in a single application.   4   Rub to make it stickYou're not done once the tape is on the skin. You also need to gently rub the tape along its surface a few times. This will help activate the adhesive to the skin.    5   Keep it dry at firstEvery kinesiology tape I have ever used was water-resistant. That means the tape should stay on while bathing or swimming. However, with so many brands flooding the market, there might be one or two that aren't as resilient as the top brands.Just check the labels and there should be no problem. I recommend that my patients keep the tape dry for at least 30-45 minutes after application to let the adhesive set.    6   Don't put heat on the tapeWhether it's a heating pad, hot pack, or dryer, keep it off of your kinesiology tape. Heat will increase the adhesion of the tape and make it hard to remove. I once had a patient have her low-back tape become melted on simply due to a heated car seat. On the other hand, applying ice is fine, and I recommend icing for injuries accompanied by acute swelling.   7   Don't rush to reapplyKinesiology tape isn't like a bandage that needs to be replaced daily. In general, a taping application should last 3-5 days. Some higher-end tapes can last for weeks, but I've also seen them come off in a couple of days from poor application. It depends on skin prep, activity levels, and patient care.   8   Be gentle with tape removalDon't just rip it off, which can cause skin irritation. Pick one corner or end free with one hand, and then press your free hand on the tape. Slide the pressure down the tape as you pull behind it. You can also make tape come off more easily by removing it in the shower or applying baby oil. REFERENCES Stanton, T. (2012, November 1). Athletes Believe in ItShould You?

However, the issue for him at the Olympia was that he was off the mark: He was smooth. Many argue that he can well afford to add a lot more mass to his 6'2"" frame.

Phil Heath (Didn't Compete Last Year)     In his pro debut year,  Phil ""The Gift"" Heath, won both the  2006 New York Pro and the  Colorado Pro.

Silvio Samuel (4th place, 2007)      I call  Silvio Samuel ""The Marathon Man."" He competed in 8 different contests in 2007, and never placed lower than 7th.

Eddie Abbew (3rd, 2007 Iron Man):   This is Eddie's 9th year on the pro circuit, but you couldn't tell from the way he looks! He always comes in as one of the best conditioned athletes on stage.

He's had to work extremely hard for every 'top ten' placing he's achieved, which are few and far between. Last year, he was in the first call-out with Toney Freeman and Mark Dugdale; here's hoping we get to see a repeat performance of that night. He's monstrous, but cut; massive, but striated; gi-normous, but ripped. No matter what country you're from, that is a winning combination.   2007 Iron Man - Eddie Abbew   Windows Media (11.0 MB)   8.

Will Harris (Didn't Compete Last Year)  ""World"" Harris is to back, like Branch Warren is to legs, like Arnold is to chest, like Sergio is to abs. He's got it! The question remains, can he bring his other body parts up to par, to match his ""World-wide"" back?

Troy Alves (Didn't Compete Last Year):  I don't have much to say about our friend, Mr. Alves.

Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide!
It is very important for me to stay fit and active during the pregnancy for my baby as well as myself. If you would like to learn more please read on to get my tips and ideas on staying fit during this trying time.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pregnancy.htm,"Note: This is part one, click here for part two!  Society puts such an importance on being fit and looking good it can be a little overwhelming. When you actually achieve that ""look"" you will do anything to hang on to it. Well, when the time comes when you start thinking that a family would be nice you also have to come to grips with the fact that your beautiful flat stomach will be a thing of the past, at least for a while.  I know that pregnancy is a beautiful thing and a growing stomach is something that is both beautiful and worthy of showing off but getting to that point is the hard part. I am now going through this process. I am 4 months pregnant, and other than a couple breakdowns when my clothes didn't fit, I am coming to the point where I am accepting my body and I am excited to see my belly grow.  Pictures from my first fitness contest. So many women think that when you get pregnant it is time to put your feet up and relax. You do need to do that sometimes, but it is also very important to stay fit and active. When I got pregnant I knew it was important to stay in shape but I wasn't sure if you follow your normal fitness program, lessen it, or do something special. When I went to go look on the Internet I found that there is just about zero out there.  It is very important for me to stay fit and active during my pregnancy for my baby, but for me also. Since there is not a lot out there I would like to take you through what I have learned and what I am doing so when the time comes for you, or if you are there, you will not be as lost as I was.   Supplements   When I decided that children were what I wanted I immediately started to take folic acid. This is very important in helping decrease the chance of serious birth defects. It is said that 70% of women know about folic acid but only 30% actually take it. It is very important to take it before, during and after pregnancy. A pre-natal multi-vitamin s also important to make sure that your body has the vitamins and minerals that you and your baby need.  One great multi-vitamin that has plenty of folic acid is Twinlab Pre-Natal. It has the correct amount of vitamins you need and it won't make you sick. That is definately a plus since most women feel sick during this time anyway.  It has been said that men who take folic acid before conception have stronger sperm and their baby has a smaller chance of something being wrong, genetic wise. Twinlab also makes their Daily One Caps with folic acid and that is what my husband took for about a year before we got pregnant.  Pregnant women also need about 60% more protein. You need that protein to make a healthy and beautiful baby. I know there can be a lot of bad tasting protein powders out there but it does not have to be that way. A couple to check out are Optimum Any Whey and Syntrax Nectar protein. The Any Whey is tasteless and so you can do anything you want with it. I sometimes put it in yogurt or my oatmeal. You really don't even know that it is there but you get high quality whey protein! The Nectar is great if you need a change. It comes in cool flavors like Cherry Berry (just like cherry kool-aid), Apple Ecstasy (just like a green jolly rancher) and Caribbean Cool (if you like alcohol you would swear it was the real thing). If you just can't stand to drink it there are always protein bars. A popular bar is the Detour Bars.  More and more has been coming out about fish oil and its benefits to your baby's brain development. Studies have shown that fish oils can help form the brain and when taken in the third trimester and after birth it can actually help improve your child's smarts! Who knows if you take your fish oils you may have the next Einstein! There are a lot of fish oil capsules out there that can make you burp all day and who wants to smell that? The one that I have had the best luck with is Health From the Sun High Potency Fish Oil. Whatever supplement you choose, be sure that it has DHA in it.  Calcium is of course very important. So many people have a deficiency even if they are not pregnant. All of the baby's bones need calcium so it will take it from you. If you are short on calcium then you are left with mere scraps. Your gums can begin to bleed and your bones can become weak. Later on in the pregnancy your back can actually hurt worse because of the lack of calcium. So remember to take that everyday. Even pre-natal vitamins do not contain 100% of your daily calcium so you will need something extra. Most dairy products contain a lot of calcium and you can also get it from broccoli, baked beans and some nuts.   Diet   Of all the things you may crave during pregnancy, remember you are not actually eating for two like many binging pregnant women say. You actually only need 300 extra calories a day! Also, you are not even eating for the baby until 18 weeks. Before that the baby just takes what it needs from your body, even if you do not eat much at all. Make sure you do eat your vitamins, protein and calcium so you do not become depleted. Sometimes it is hard to eat during the first trimester because your body is so full of hormones but that is okay. You can live off of crackers and Sprite and your baby will be fine.  There are also certain foods you want to stay away from that can harm your baby. There have not been a lot of studies on this but one sweetener you want to stay away from is saccharin. Animal studies show an increase in cancer in offspring. Not something I would want to chance. All of the others seem to be okay but you should limit it to 1-2 servings per day.  You will want to avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, shell fish and tilefish because it has such a high level of mercury per serving. This can pose a risk to the child's developing nervous system. Canned tuna is okay once a week but fresh tuna has too much mercury also. Grouper, Amberjack and mahi mahi have a high level of toxins so you should stay way from them too. There are still plenty of fish that are good to eat such as salmon, sea bass, haddock, halibut, cod, sole, flounder, perch and farm raised trout. Remember those fish oils are good for the baby's brain.  You should try and stay away from foods that are preserved with nitrates. You can check the label to be sure. Some examples are hot dogs, salami and lunch meat. Stay away from soft cheeses like brie, feta, and blue-veined cheeses. There is a chance of listeria. You should stay away from uncooked eggs, pate and under cooked meats because there is a chance of salmonella. It is also said that too much soy can slow down the development of the sex organs in boys. Until I find out what sex my baby is, I am done with soy! Make sure when you eat fruit and vegetables you wash them very well. You, as well as you baby, do not want the pesticides that can be left on the food.  No matter what you eat you will probably get bloated and get gas. Your intestines have slowed everything down to ensure that the baby gets the vitamins it needs. Just make sure to eat slow.  Another thing to remember is to floss! You have a higher risk of gum disease and that can lead to preeclampsia and preterm labor. Get a dental checkup and cleaning as soon as you can.   Preventing Morning Sickness    There are some things you can do to prevent the dreaded morning sickness. Be sure to drink lots of water... you need this anyway because it helps replace the amniotic fluid for your baby. Exercising can help as well. Make sure you eat right and get plenty of sleep. If you are unable to sleep the whole night you should take short naps through out the day. Being tired can make you even more nauseous.   Things You Should Immediately Stop Doing   One thing you need to do right now is quit smoking. It is very harmful to the baby. If you smoke, it will live it's first 9 months in a smoke filled womb, cough violently and it may hinder the babies growth. It is also believed that smoking can cause your baby to be more susceptible to cot death. Also, alcohol is another big no-no. More and more studies have shown that alcohol is very harmful to a baby. When you take a drink so does the baby. Just think if it takes you, an adult, three drinks to get tipsy, your baby is on the verge of passing out he is so drunk. It also can increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects when the baby is born. So no, you can't have just one drink. You are obviously not a virgin anymore, but your drinks should be.  Caffeine is not a good idea either. The same idea as the alcohol is there. Caffeine keeps you going and gets your system moving. Just think of the effects those stimulants have on your tiny unborn baby. His heartbeat is 150-180 beats per minute as it is so you do not want it any higher! Studies have shown that there is an increase of stillbirth with too much caffeine. Most doctors agree that a little caffeine each day, like only one cup of coffee, probably won't hurt your baby... but why even chance it?  Average weight gain is 25-30 pounds. It is said that only 38% of women gain what they are supposed to. Women who eat a high fat diet while pregnant may increase the risk of the child developing heart problems later in life. If you gain too much weight it can cause problems like diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia in you and all of this can lead to overly large babies. I am not sure about you but I prefer not to push out a 10lb baby. If you are overweight you also have a higher risk of cesarean delivery and studies have shown that you might also have a problem with lactating.  Also, and this is just as bad, if you gain too much weight during pregnancy it can take up to 2 years of hard work just to get it off. Many women don't realize that gaining too much weight during pregnancy can cause health problems for the mom and the baby for the rest of their lives. It helps you and your baby be healthy if you can stay in this range.   Working Out: Cardio And Lifting Weights   Of all the things that can help, one of the major things is working out. You can be pregnant and still workout. Here are some guidelines to be safe and healthy. When you do cardio, just make sure that you are not so out of breath that you can't carry on a conversation. If you used to run you should go to fast walking. You do not want to do anything that is really jarring to your body. The stair stepper is great... just make sure that if someone came up to you, you could talk to them no problem. Also, when you are working out make sure you do not overheat. If you are hot, so is your baby. Drinks lots of water and try and workout indoors if at all possible. Lifting weights doesn't have to be abandoned either. You shouldn't be trying to go for any new personal lifting records but you don't have to stick to the 5 pound dumbbells either. The rule of thumb is to make sure you can carry on a conversation. If you are in the middle of bicep curls make sure you can talk to someone with no problem. Never go to muscular failure on your reps. If you need a workout here is the one that I am doing. It is a basic program and it works great.

I try and make it to the gym twice a week for weights. I used to go to the gym three times a week but I am waiting for some of my energy to come back. Going to the gym twice a week will still give you great benefits and muscle tone. I also do cardio 4-6 times per week for 45 minutes. I just get on my treadmill and read a book. Once I get into a book the time flies for me. You do not have to do this as long or as much as I do but try and at least do cardio 3 times per week. Your body is pumping more blood through your body and you will want as healthy heart as you can get.  So why should you keep working out? Working out has shown to lower the risk of problems with the child, lower risk of cesarean and lower risk of diabetes. It has also shown that exercise during the first and second trimester help reduce the risk of premature birth. Keeping your legs and lower back muscles in shape can help prevent back pain later in pregnancy. Also, staying in shape can make it much easier for you to lose your pregnancy weight after your baby is born and get back on track with your normal fitness program.  Another exercise that is important is the Kegel exercises. You do them by pretending you have to go to the bathroom and squeezing your opening shut and then relaxing. You will want to do 50 ""reps"" per day. This strengthens your pelvic floor and can help with bladder control during and after pregnancy. One really good benefit is that the stronger your pelvic wall, the better the orgasm. Enough for me! Remember if you experience any of these during exercise stop immediately and contact your doctor:  Contact Your Doctor If These Symptoms Appear: Pain, especially in your back or pelvic region Excessive tiredness Dizziness Shortness of breath Feeling Faint Vaginal bleeding Difficulty walking Contractions Remember if you work out, even if you do not feel like it, it will help you get some energy. I know that even when I feel like I do not want to get on the treadmill, once I am done I feel so much better and have more energy than before I started!  The whole point of following the advice in this article is to have a healthy baby, a healthy body, and a safe and easy pregnancy. It will help you lose the weight and help the baby now and later on in life. Everything that I have talked about I am doing. I have had barely any morning sickness and the couple of bouts I did have I never threw up. I am tired a lot but I find that if I get on the treadmill it helps me wake up. My appetite has been great and I do sometimes crave the sour things like dill pickles and pickled eggs. Acne can be a side effect of pregnancy but so far with a healthy diet and exercise that has not been a problem for me. I have only gained 5 pounds so far. I am starting to get a little pooch and I love it. I can't wait to look pregnant and get to buy all the cute maternity clothes.  I hope that this has helped you and if you any questions you can email me at Bryna@bodybuilders.com. I will be checking in every month to let you know how it is going and what is going on in the pregnancy and I will give tips on what you need to be doing next.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simone4.htm,"Note: This is part two, click here for part 1! click here for part 3!  Month One & Two: The very first month was by far the easiest so far. Then again, the first two weeks of what doctors consider ""pregnancy,"" conception hasn't yet taken place. The next month following I continued to feel quite un-pregnant and my fitness regimen went on just as normal and smoothly as it has the past few years.  During my sixth week of pregnancy I began to loose energy and strength, nausea began to set in and boy did things begin to change then. I continued to work out, but workouts were a struggle to get through and two sessions quickly became one. My eating habits began to plummet as rice cakes and multigrain saltines became my best friends. It was all I could do to keep from feeling nauseous and light headed. By week nine I would spend my lunch hour sleeping in the car instead of going to the gym. I was exhausted, but not without hope.  Month Three: I had my first OB appointment on the first day of my ninth week. I had plenty of questions for him and hoped that he would be able to provide me with insight on how to boost my energy and tame my nausea. The good news was he could tell that I was a healthy individual and there was a light at the end of the tunnel. He said that the second trimester is usually much better. The bad news was there wasn't anything that I wasn't already trying that would help me get through the morning sickness any better. Cutting back on carbs and increasing protein would help my energy, but I would still need to do what I could to help control the nausea and yes, that means that complex carbs would continue to be my best friend for a while longer.  My OB and I also talked about my vitamins and nutrition as well as my fitness routine. Although I was taking a multi-vitamin daily, he prescribed a pre-natal vitamin that contained everything my growing baby would need over the next nine months. I later questioned him about the absence of electrolytes in the pre-natal vitamins and he told me that I could continue to receive these additional nutrients from Gatorade if I so desired. The most important thing that my doctor told me was that pregnancy is not an illness and not to treat it that way.  He told me that I can do everything that I'm used to doing in my daily routine with the exception of alcohol and illicit drugs. I was even shocked to find out that I would be able to do my normal ab work out. My OB said that I would get to a point when my belly was too big and I would be too uncomfortable to do certain movements, but until then I should keep on keepin' on.  Tips: Listen to your body. Rest when you are tired and don't feel guilty for missing a work out! Don't use pregnancy as an excuse to eat whatever you want, but if you are having trouble with nausea or keeping foods down, Remember... eating foods that are not necessarily considered to be the healthiest of foods is much better than not eating anything at all. Your baby needs to be fed and that is the most important thing at this point in time!  Keep in mind all things should be done in moderation. Freeze Gatorade for a slushy treat. This also is good for those times when nothing else, even liquids won't stay down. Protein Shakes are a good way to continue to get nutrients even when solid proteins tend to not sit well on the stomach. Please feel free to contact me at Simone@Simone6i.com with any questions.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/staying_healthy_while_pregnant.htm,"Staying Healthy While Pregnant  Making the decision to have a baby is one of the biggest decisions a woman will make in her lifetime. Those who are heavily involved with their workouts are sometimes a little tentative to make this decision because they know that it's a long nine months where they will have to be adapting their current workout regime and then can be a long time after getting back to their pre-baby weight, depending on the individual situation.  Some new mothers regain their pre-baby body very quickly, while for others, those last few pregnancy pounds just don't want to seem to leave.  To any woman who's put in a lot of time and effort getting to and maintaining a lower body fat level, this almost always does cause some degree of anxiety.  Click Image To Enlarge.Making The Decision To Have A Baby Is One Of TheBiggest Decisions A Woman Will Make In Her Lifetime. Because of this, it's important to learn what you can do in terms of your workouts during pregnancy and the best methods to stay healthy while pregnant, not only for yourself, but for your unborn child. Here are the big points you need to know about staying healthy while pregnant.  Benefits Of Exercising During Pregnancy   Many years ago, women were actually advised to stay away from exercise entirely during pregnancy, but now things have changed and most are encouraged to participate in some form of exercise on a regular basis.  First off, participating in exercise will help you feel better as the body will be moving around, keeping the blood circulating to the various tissues. This goes a long way to help out with cramping that may occur when pregnant, as well as helping to boost your overall energy levels.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Pregnancy: Staying Fit!   Are you pregnant and not sure about healthy weight gain? You can stay fit during this time by using the following nutrition and training guidelines.   Author: Melissa Johnsen  Staying active can also help to reduce the occurrence of headaches, backaches (provided exercise is performed properly), and helps to reduce joint soreness since the more active your joints stay, the more active the lubricating fluid within the joint will be.  Since exercise does burn calories as well, keeping active can help keep the pregnancy weight gain at bay, however note that you should never exercise with the purpose of losing weight while pregnant, unless you are at a very heavy weight to start with and have your doctor's recommendation to try and shed a few pounds.  Your body needs the extra calories at this point for the baby's development, so you must not short yourself - the exercise will simply help to prevent too much additional fat gain.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Pregnant & Working Out.   I recently losta lot of weight and now I'm really starting to miss working out. I've been told that I can do cardio but only walking and at low speeds.   Started By: Stoofinoof  Not to mention that staying active while pregnant will make getting back into your workouts after pregnancy that much easier.  Exercise Guidelines During Pregnancy   Heart Rate Issues:     One of the oldest  myths about exercising while pregnant was that you should keep your  heart rate at 130 beats per minute or lower. You were instructed that if it went higher with this, you should back down immediately.   Now this is changing and it is seen to be safe to work out a little harder. A better guideline to use is a rate of perceived exertion. This is also better because different women will have naturally different heart rates when performing exercise.  Related Heart Rate Articles:  Measuring Your Heart Rate For Fitness. - By Lisa Moser How To Calculate Your Heart Rate! - By Matt Danielsson Heart Matters: Are You Training Your Heart? - By Jeremy Likness Other Heart Rate Articles...  For example, one woman working at one pace may find her heart speeds to 120 beats per minute, while another one equally as fit might find it speeds to 140 beats per minute. This a genetic variation that needs to be accounted for.  So instead, try and keep your rate of perceived exertion somewhere around the five to seven mark during the early stages of pregnancy and four to six mark closer to when you're due (on a scale of one to ten).   Abdominal Exercises - Yes Or No?     When pregnant, many women worry about performing any type of  abdominal exercises for fear it may crush their baby.   While you definitely don't want to lie right on your stomach during pregnancy, you can safely still perform many abdominal exercises.  During the first trimester some light crunches can still be performed, however after this time as you move into your second trimester, avoid any exercises that you perform lying on your back.  Click Image To Enlarge.Crunches.Video Guide: Windows Media - MPEG - Video iPod  Good options at this point would include simple  stomach contractions (tightening and holding it), standing pelvic tilts, or some gentle  knee raises while hanging from a padded standing ab machine.   Being Aware Of High Intensity Lifting Movements:     While pregnant, one thing you will want to avoid so you stay healthy and safe with your workouts is very intense weight lifting exercises that will require strong muscle contractions.   When pregnant, the body will release a hormone that is designed to naturally help relax the joint tissues, so this will counteract what you are aiming to do, setting you up for injury. The big exercises to avoid are squats, lunges, one leg split squats, push-ups, and the bench press.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Training & Pregnancy!   After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries.    Author: David Robson   All of these are using the major joints and if the joints are too loose, you'll really struggle.   Paying Attention To Balance:     You'll also want to focus on your balancing abilities while pregnant as often these are impacted quite heavily. Avoid performing too many exercises that do require precise balance, so as to prevent falling over and suffering an injury to you or the baby.  Click Image To Enlarge.Author, Shannon Clark: ""Avoid PerformingToo Many Exercises That Require Precise Balance.""  Know When To Stop:     While you definitely should keep up your exercise program, it's vital that you do learn to recognize the warning signs that are telling you to stop.   In the past you may have forced yourself to just push through the pain, but now that you're pregnant this is not a smart move. Signals that you need to back off the exercise include feeling dizzy, lightheaded, having pain anywhere near the abdominal region, suffering spotting, or feeling nauseous.

Weight Training & Pregnancy!
After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries. This article will provide guidelines on pre-natal exercise and other health considerations.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson10.htm,"What might be the benefits of weight training, and other forms of exercise, in the months leading up to childbirth? This was a question asked of me by my wife recently.  She is pregnant and like most women wants to ensure the good health of both herself and the baby she is carrying. This prompted me to research the area of pre-natal exercising. I found that it is beneficial to exercise while pregnant for a number of reasons.  Indeed, those who exercise while pregnant enjoy many advantages over their non-exercising counterparts.  These include: Fewer problems experienced during childbirth  Enhanced post natal recovery  Lower incidence of backaches and less severe headaches  Enhanced body image  Feelings of wellbeing and happiness, and a positive self image  Increased energy levels  Increased flexibility  Increased aerobic capacity  Better circulation of blood to the extremities  Greater muscle strength and coordination, which helps with adjusting to increased bodyweight and changes in balance.  Pregnancy-related constipation avoidance Although these benefits can be realised through exercise, certain guidelines do need to be followed. A pregnant woman is quite vulnerable and precautions need to be taken to ensure that certain exercise stresses do not have a deleterious impact.  After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries. This article will provide guidelines on pre-natal exercise and other health considerations.  As a woman undergoes her special metamorphosis, as the pregnancy draws near, exercising might prove to be most beneficial in assisting overall pre-natal health and a successful birth.  The Why & How Of Pre-Natal Exercise?   The changes associated with pregnancy can cause a multitude of problems for the child-bearer. Many of these problems are related to a weakened musculature as a result of inactivity coupled with the additional stress placed upon the body as a result of pregnancy related weight gain.  Exercise in general, and weight training in particular, can strengthen supporting muscles and lessen the back pain and overall muscle and joint weakness associated with pregnancy. The best exercises are ones that do not cause strain.  In particular, avoid any exercise that involves lying on the front, as this will place pressure on the abdomen and cause pain. Instead, exercises should focus on the muscle groups that undergo pregnancy related stress.  The following exercises, with their corresponding body parts, are advised: Dumbbell bench presses for the pectorals.  Dumbbell shrugs for the trapezius.  Bent over shoulder laterals for rear deltoids and rhomboids.  Hyperextensions for lower back.  Hip abductors (outer thigh) and adductors (inner thigh) for hip and pelvic region. Exercise ball crunches and for the abbs: training abbs while pregnant can be problematic as the inferior vena cava is compressed when the back is in a flat position.  It is better to execute the crunch on an exercise ball in a supine (facing up) inclined position. The back muscles also benefit from this particular exercise through increased strength and flexibility. Hip abductor/abductor and abb work also play a part in reducing lordosis of the spine.  As the fetus grows, the abdominal muscles are stretched and weakened and this causes the lower back muscles to shorten. Additional stretching of the hip-flexor muscles will prevent exacerbating the lordotic condition.  Exercise ball squats for quadriceps: hormonal (relaxin) increases result in softer connective tissue surrounding the joints, so try to refrain from deep knee flexion and, instead, concentrate on the upper part of the movement.  The exercise ball makes an excellent substitute for a regular bar squat and is a much safer option. The regular squat forces the wrist into a flexed position and this causes numbness and tingling in someone who is pregnant. The oedema (tissue swelling) associated with pregnancy causes compression of the median nerve in the wrist and when the wrist is flexed these symptoms occur.  Light weights should be used for all exercises to prevent any unnecessary stresses or strains. The rational for using these exercises exclusively, as part of the weight training component of an exercise routine, is they focus primarily on the areas that tend to weaken the most due to pregnancy.  The extra weight of the breasts during pregnancy tends to pull the shoulders forward shortening the pectoral muscles and overstretching and weakening the rhomboid and trapezium muscles in the back (Kyphosis).  During the preceding exercises one should therefore try to really stretch the muscles being worked. Also, worth noting is the value of moderation. It is best not too train to hard for too long as this may cause additional stress and negate the session's benefits.    Three full-body sessions per week, provided weights are light and motivation is high will be sufficient.  Although this article, strictly speaking, is about the benefits of weight training for the pregnant woman, it is worth mentioning the value of aerobics.  Aerobic training will assist the weight training sessions as it would in a regular exercise regime. Waste product removal, fat loss and enhanced cardiovascular function are three benefits to be gained from aerobic work. A 20-30 minute walk three to four times per week should be sufficient.  Guidelines & Precautions   Now that the exercises and training recommendations have been determined, certain guidelines need to be followed.  In response to a pregnancy a woman will undergo a series of changes that may impact exercise safety. Probably the most significant of these changes are cardiovascular.  During pregnancy, blood volume increases approximately 40% and the more blood that has to be circulated the faster the heart has to beat to complete this job. Heart rate and cardiac output increase as a result. Dizziness may also occur as a result of the additional pressure placed on the large veins in the back region that take blood back to the heart from the lower extremities.  This can have implications when training, and, as such, it is advised not to engage in work that involves lying on the back and elevating the legs.  In terms of cardiac output, it is best to monitor exercise intensity and keep track of heart rate. Heart rate should not exceed 140 beats per minute for longer than one minute as this could result in increased cardiac output and fatigue. Follow all exercise with at least ten minutes of cool down work to restore heart rate.  Metabolism and hormonal changes also occur during pregnancy. A woman's core temperature will rise as a result of an increased metabolic rate and this could have serious consequences in terms of foetal health.  A significantly elevated body temperature can cause foetal damage making this particular problem precarious to say the least. The most vulnerable period is the first trimester (the first four weeks). To counter any potential problems drink plenty of water before, during and after training, avoid exercise in hot humid environments and stop often during the session to stabilise temperature.  The hormonal changes specifically revolve around the hormones estrogen, progesterone, relaxin and elastin. Connective tissues and joints are softened and relaxed in preparation for childbirth, dur to the interplay of these hormones, making a pregnant woman more susceptible to injury.  To counter these problems never overextend or engage in deep flexion of any type, warm up for longer than usual and avoid high-impact exercise that requires jarring, jumping or forceful movements.  In addition to pregnancy related changes and their considerations, one should also be mindful of the following. Do not hold breath but continually breath throughout. In general, exhale on exertion.  Drink plenty of fluid before during and after training to prevent dehydration.  Check for abdominal muscle separation weekly. During pregnancy hormones cause the centre seam in the abdominal muscles to soften and stretch as the baby grows and the abdomen expands.  Ab training, as explained, should help to prevent separation but if it does the following can be done to correct it: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands on your abdomen with your fingertips pointing down toward your pubic bone. Exhale as you slowly lift your head and shoulders while pressing down and in with your fingers - that will encourage the abbs to reconnect.  Activities which require coordination and precise balance should be avoided. Increased weight, softening and increased mobility of joints and ligaments, and shifting centre of gravity may alter ones ability to coordinate muscles.  Muscles should be appropriately stretched before and throughout training.  It might be wise to reduce energy output as pregnancy progresses. A larger energy output will be required as more weight is gained and fatigue will occur more readily.  And most important of all: consult with your physician before undertaking any training program as there might be certain contraindications that only a qualified physician can identify. Dietary Considerations   During pregnancy blood sugar levels typically drop quite significantly. Blood sugar levels will also fluctuate. In addition, noradrenaline (a hormone responsible for sending blood sugar into cells to be utilised) will be released during exercise.  The blood stream becomes dramatically low in blood sugar as a result of this and the aforementioned pregnancy related blood sugar lowering.  A pregnant exerciser who trains too hard for too long may feel dizzy and lose concentration as the brain uses only blood glucose (sugar) for energy. This could result in injury or worse. To avoid these consequences: eat about two servings of a high complex carbohydrate food (rice or potato for example) between 60 to 90 minutes prior to training.  During training, and indeed, pregnancy, correct nutrition is paramount. Folic acid will help to maintain overall health in general and reduce the possibility of neural tube defects (spina bifida and anencephaly) in particular. 400 micrograms per day is recommended.  Folic acid is a member of the B-complex family of vitamins and can be found, naturally occurring in green leafy vegetables, legumes and dried beans. Certain breakfast cereals contain sufficient folic acid. Folic acid can also be consumed in supplement form or easier digestion and convenience.  Conclusion   Pregnancy is a special time, belied by the turmoil that takes place in a woman's body. Hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and blood sugar changes create an environment where additional care needs to be taken, in particular when it comes to exercising.  Rather than stop completely and forgo the wonderful benefits of exercise, it is best to continue on, using the modifications suggested in this article. An expectant mother can enhance her transformation while maintaining her beauty and grace through exercise.

So You're Pregnant:  Now What?
It is the time many women wait for all their lives.  The time when they are going to produce a life of their own.  Some people will spend years trying to become pregnant, hoping and praying. Here is some advice to staying healthy during this time.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sclark17.htm,"It is the time many women wait for all their lives. The time when they are going to produce a life of their own. Some people will spend years trying to become pregnant, hoping and praying, but when it finally happens, have no idea what to do with their workouts. Some women view pregnancy as a time when they can relax and eat to their hearts content using it as an excuse for getting out of shape. These people forget however that they will have to deal with the consequences of their actions after the baby is born.  How many times have we heard one women say to another, ""It's a amazing how fast she managed to loose her baby weight... I had my baby 3 years ago and I still can't seem to loose the last bit of mine"".  Instead of giving yourself the green light to the 9 month long buffet that many women embark on, vow to keep up with your exercise regime as much as possible, nourish your body with proper foods so that both you and your baby will be healthier after you give birth, and use exercise as a chance to reconnect and prepare yourself for the changes in your life that are to come.   Exercise Still A Possibility   During your pregnancy, your fitness goals will change to more of a maintenance state rather than an improve performance state. You can still complete both aerobic and strength training, however various modifications and restrictions will be in place.   Aerobic Exercise     With regards to aerobic exercise, the newly pregnant women should choose an exercise that she enjoys and that is not too strenuous on the body. Make sure the exercise will not risk your balance because any sort of fall could cause trauma to the growing baby.   You also need to choose a moderate form of exercise as a drastic increase in core body temperature is thought to be harmful to the fetus by increasing the risk of congenital anomalies and shifting the blood to skeletal muscles rather than the baby.  Good examples of cardiovascular exercise to include are walking, either on a flat surface or on a slight incline (for those who are already in advanced cardiovascular shape - note: during pregnancy you should not try to increase the intensity of your workouts at all), swimming, or stationary biking.  If you begin to feel breathless at all during your workout you should stop immediately until it has passed and then if you feel well enough continue, but do so at a reduced intensity.  Here is a reference chart for target heart rate ranges during pregnancy:  Maternal AgeHeart Rate Target (beats/min)Heart Rate Target Zone (beats/min)Less than 20 140-15523-2620-29 135-15022-2530-39 130-14521-2440 or greater 125-140 20-23  Calculate Your Maximum HR Calculator Here...  Strength Training   Strength training is also important to continue into pregnancy. By continuing with your routine you will help keep your muscles strong, which will make everyday activities easier (since you will now be carrying additional weight due to your baby), and will also help keep your bones strong throughout and after your pregnancy.   Women who perform strength exercises for their pelvic muscles also decrease the risk of urinary incontinence which can occur during and after pregnancy.  Choose Type Of Exercise Carefully:     The choice of strength training exercises to include is important to consider. No exercises should be done where the woman is laying on her stomach (such as   laying hamstring curls, back raises, etc) as this will put extreme stress on the baby.    Also, after 20 weeks of pregnancy, it is advised that you don't do any exercises on your back either, as the added weight of the baby can interfere with blood circulation.  You also want to refrain from using very heavy weights as these will place a great deal of stress on the body and the recovery systems which should not be compromised as this may affect the health of your baby.  Seated Exercises Are Good Choices: seated rows seated bicep curls overhead tricep extensions leg extensions sitting hamstring curls lateral pull-downs seated chest presses  As with aerobic training, pregnancy is not the time to decide you want to sprout new muscles, it's a time to maintain and preserve your current strength.  Therefore, take care to use sensible weights, reps and rest periods as to keep your workouts stimulating but also comfortable at the same time.   Yoga    Another great option for pregnant women is yoga. Obviously you don't want to be twisting into odd pretzel shapes during this time, but simple yoga moves that focus on proper breathing and body control will give you the benefit of stress relief, enhanced flexibility and a general sense of calm and collectiveness.   These days, many gyms offer prenatal yoga classes that are specifically designed with pregnant women in mind.  An additional consideration with regards to exercise during pregnancy is that some women may find that they wish to refrain from exercising during the first trimester until the nausea and fatigue have passed.

Learn More About Yoga Here...After Baby Arrives Finally, once the baby is born and healthy, it is important to ensure you are fully recovered from the process of childbirth before restarting exercise once again. When you are feeling good enough to work out, start off slowly, as you did when you first became pregnant and gradually work your way back up to the intensity levels you were at prior to your pregnancy.  Realize that you will not be able to regain your prior fitness level overnight, so if you were running 5 miles a day before don't go out and try those same 5 mile runs right away, or you'll just end up home, sore and unable to take care of your newborn baby.  Have patience with yourself and enjoy your workouts with the journey back into fitness. Take care of your nutrition and remember you can't loose all your baby weight right away, but with good planning and assuming you stayed relatively fit and gained the minimal recommended amount of weight, you'll be back to your shape in no time!

[ Click here to learn more. ]  Also remember that you now have a baby in your life, which is going to be very time consuming and demanding, may not wait patiently while you finish your workouts. You may have to reduce your workout frequency and duration because you will be spending much more time looking after your child. This is perfectly understandable so just tell yourself that once you get a chance you will once again commit to your old exercise regime.  While it is important to be aware of the risk associated with exercises during pregnancy and how to avoid them, also consider the risks of not exercising.  These include loss of muscle mass, loss of cardiovascular fitness level, increased chance of weight gain, the development of sleeping problems and lower back pain, varicose veins, and increased psychological stress levels.  By keeping your body in shape, you will also help keep your mind in shape and will better prepare yourself for the journey you are about to take with your new baby.

Exercise during pregnancy should focus on maintaining the health of mom, and strengthening her for ease of the delivery process, rather than specifically focused on the cosmetic benefits of exercise.  It's also important to keep in mind that pregnant women and breast-feeding moms have increased calorie needs.

Choose instead, lower impact activities, such as running only on level terrain, walk-running, or using swimming, cycling, treadmill walking or low-impact step mill climbing. Exercise with longer, but with less intense bouts than your non-pregnant friends. (According to the ISSA recommendations, a pregnant woman should exercise at up to 50% of her maximal oxygen uptake, as opposed to 60% for non-pregnant women.) Resistance exercises are generally safe to perform, as long as consideration is given for the changes in the physical shape of the woman during pregnancy. Resistance exercises should be performed in a stable posture, seated is preferred. Supine exercises should be avoided after the first trimester. Vigorous or high-intensity exercise training, or exercising to exhaustion, should be avoided. Keep intensity levels moderate. Stay well-hydrated and well nourished!
