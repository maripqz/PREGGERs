Bowen Technique
",http://naturalterrain.com/bowen-technique/,"Bowen Technique Bowen Technique was developed in Australia in the 1950s. Today, it is known around the world for its effective yet gentle treatment of a wide variety of ailments. Bowen is a cross-fiber, soft-tissue treatment. It approaches the body with the principle of structure governs function. Meaning, when the structures are returned to a healthy state, proper function will be restored. During a Bowen appointment, a series of small moves are made over specific points on the body, usually over muscles, tendons or ligaments. These moves are done in a sequence that involves pauses, which allow the body time to integrate what has just been done and to heal itself. Bowen is gentle and relaxing, putting the body into parasympathetic mode, the most effective state for healing. Bowen is safe for anyone including newborns, pregnant women, the elderly as well as frail individuals. People often find substantial and lasting relief in very few treatment sessions. Bowen is useful for a wide variety of acute or chronic conditions, including: Musculoskeletal conditions  Sciatica Concussions Back pain Carpal tunnel Whiplash Frozen shoulder TMJ disorders Torticollis Scoliosis Neck restrictions Postural problems Bursitis Hammer toes Bunions Tension headaches Tendonitis Repetitive strain injuries Knee or ankle problems Flat feet Unresolved musculoskeletal pain Migraines  Digestive concerns  Irritable bowel Constipation Colic  Respiratory concerns  Asthma Sinusitis  Other  Fertility issues Anxiety Incontinence or bed wetting   If you have questions or would like to book an appointment, please call the clinic at 587-521-3595.

Is your body a toxic wasteland? – Part 2 by Dr. Chris
",http://naturalterrain.com/body-toxic-wasteland-part-2-dr-chris/,"Environmental Solutions: Part 2 When comparing our modern-day lives with those of our grandparents, it is clear that our environment has changed greatly. Not just the natural world, but in our day-to-day lives as well. We are exposed to far more chemicals, toxins, and different forms of radiation than generations past. At the same time chronic disease rates are soaring. Environmental exposures are the sum total of the things were exposed to on any given day  this includes eating, drinking, breathing, cosmetic use and all the other products we use. But you can take control of your health by paying attention to your environmental exposures! Below is part two of a three-part series on environmental exposures and their solutions.  Artificial food colouring  A 2010 report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest(CSPI) explored the dangers of many FDA-approved food dyes, and highlights an increased risk of allergic reactions, carcinogenicity and nerve damage as well as pointing out faults in studies that were originally used to prove safety to the FDA for approval.5 Other studies show an increased risk of ADHD and attentional deficiencies in children.6 Appropriate long-term and in-utero exposure studies simply have not been done. CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobson, co-author of the report said, These synthetic chemicals do absolutely nothing to improve the nutritional quality or safety of foods, but trigger behaviour problems in children and, possibly, cancer in anybody (Yik, 2010).  Canned goods (eg. soup or beans from a can)  Most food cans are lined with a plastic coat containing BPA, unless otherwise specified. As discussed in the previous environmental solutions article, BPA is a known endocrine disruptor that is linked negative birth outcomes, infertility, thyroid dysfunction, increased risk of cancer, obesity and insulin resistance.4, 7, 9 Even if youre avoiding all plastics you may still be exposed to BPA through canned foods. The best way to reduce exposure is to limit your consumption of canned food, particularly if you are pregnant. Look for canned food that is labeled as BPA-free or buy food packed in glass jars or waxed cardboard cartons. A few companies sell cans lined with non-BPA alternatives, such as Eden Organics.  Cosmetic products with Phthalates or Parabens  These are two more chemical families that are hazardous endocrine disruptors. Pthalates and parabens are found in most cosmetic products and in many shampoos, moisturizers and fragrances, though they may not be listed. While they are not banned in cosmetics in Canada, the European Union has restrictions on the amount of parabens permitted in cosmetics, based on evidence that they interfere with hormone function. Parabens can mimic estrogen, the primary female sex hormone. They have been detected in human breast cancer tissues, suggesting a possible association between parabens in cosmetics and cancer.1 Further studies indicate that a specific paraben applied on the skin from moisturizers can react withUVBleading to increased skin aging andDNAdamage.3 Pthalates, on the other hand, have been linked with asthma, ADHD, breast cancer, autism spectrum disorders, obesity and type 2 diabetes, altered reproductive development and male infertility.10 Lower your exposure by using only natural phthalate and paraben-free personal care products such as Tarte Cosmetics, Lush, Aveda, and Mineral Fusion. Avoid using commercial perfume and opt for essential oils instead.  Perfume and fragrances  This is another common exposure to dangerous phthalate compounds that can affect hormone levels and raise risk of several diseases. Although you may be diligent about reading ingredients list, phthalates are often not listed. The word Fragrance or Parfum, however, near the end ofthe ingredient list is your clue that the product contains phthalates. Anything with artificial fragrance is a potential risk to your endocrine system. Its best to stick to natural essential oils and natural deodorants.  Genetically Modified Foods (e.g. corn, soy, canola, cottonseed and beet sugar)  Despite much controversy over the safety of GMO foods, the truth is that we dont have enough research to deem them safe for human consumption. In popular news, there have been ten scientific studies that famously presented troubling information about the potential effects of GMO foods, citing toxins found in blood, causation of gluten-intolerance disorders, damage to the digestive tract, increased carcinogenicity, birth defects and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons.8 These studies, however, have been criticized for accuracy and validity, leaving the public at the mercy of the economics that drive the general food supply. Without studies proving it definitively one way or another, restrictions and regulations are not seen unless an entire country bans their cultivation altogether, which over 30 countries worldwide have done. This is an important topic to discuss with your naturopathic doctor and your family to decide how you can protect yourself. One step you can take is to limit the consumption of the most commonly modified foods: corn, soy, canola, cotton and beets.  Non-organic food: Pesticides and other food sprays  Agriculture is an industry that uses thousands of chemicals to help the growth of food for sale and for processing. Food that is grown with the use of synthetic insecticides or other chemicals are considered non-organic, or conventional. Organic food is grown with no or naturally-derived insecticides. Some of the most-used synthetic pesticides, such as organophosphates and glycol ethers, have been identified as endocrine disruptors- similar to BPA, phthalates and parabens. Many pesticides contain ingredients known to increase risk of cancer, reproductive difficulties and neurological disease (David Suzuki Foundation, 2016). Children are the most vulnerable to the negative effects of non-organic food. Not only are they harmful for your health, pesticides are damaging to the environment where they are used; dangerous concentrations in the soil can result in killing local ecosystem life. Limiting your exposure to pesticides is an important consideration. Start with the Dirty Dozen foods: the 12 foods most heavily sprayed with pesticides- buy these organic and you will decrease your familys exposure to pesticides. If you cant buy these organic, stick with the Clean Fifteen foods: the least sprayed produce. The Dirty Dozen (in order of contamination) Apples Celery Sweet bell peppers Peaches Strawberries Nectarines Grapes Spinach Lettuce Cucumbers Blueberries Potatoes The Clean 15 (in order of least contamination) Onions Sweet Corn Pineapples Avocado Cabbage Sweet peas Asparagus Mangoes Eggplant Kiwi Cantaloupe Sweet potatoes Grapefruit Watermelon Mushrooms  Manufactured orange juice  Most store-bought orange juice is so heavily processed that it is barely orange juice anymore. Despite marketing to make it seem pure and natural, and claims that it is made from 100% orange juice, the juice is far from what comes out of an orange. Once oranges are pressed, the juice can be stored for months or even up to a year. Because it is stored so long, the oxygen is removed from the storage tanks to keep the juice from going bad. The flavor is also lost in this process, however, and is later added back in synthetic compounds that are manufactured to make the juice taste like oranges again when its time to be sold. In addition, one glass (250mL) of Tropicana juice contains 25g of sugar, which is 75% of the sugar in a can or regular coke! In the end, what is marketed as 100% pure is often a sugary, chemical modification of a once-natural product. Your best option for natural vitamin C is to juice your own oranges. Add carrot and other fruits to boost the vitamins and nutrients. Keep the pulp for the added benefit of fiber!  Hand sanitizer, antibacterial soap, toothpastes with Triclosan  Triclosan is a chemical common used in disinfectants, soaps and some brands of toothpaste. It is known to interfere with a natural detoxification process in the liver that helps flush toxins from the body, leaving toxins to accumulate. Studies show clear correlation with increased liver tumors, hormone disruption and muscle function impairment in animals. The FDA has recognized that antibacterial products work no better than regular soap and water and may also be contributing to antibiotic resistance.2 The best option for limiting exposure to triclosan is to avoid antibacterial sanitizer and soaps. Read your toothpaste labels and ensure they dont contain any triclosan and try to avoid artificial sweeteners as well.

Is your body a toxic wasteland? – Part 1 by Dr. Chris
",http://naturalterrain.com/body-toxic-wasteland-part-1-dr-chris/,"Is your body a toxic wasteland?  Part 1 When comparing our modern-day lives with those of our grandparents, it is clear that our environment has changed greatly. Not just the natural world, but in our day-to-day lives as well. We are exposed to exponentially more chemicals, toxins, and different forms of radiation than the generations before us. At the same time chronic disease rates are soaring and researchers are making connections between what is in our environment and why we are getting sick. Environmental exposures are a serious concern not only for our world today, but for our health. You can take control of your health by paying attention to and limiting your personal environmental exposures. Below is part one of a three-part series on environmental exposures and their solutions.  Problem: Full-sugar soft drinks and diet soft drinks  It is well recognized that sugary soft drinks are unhealthy for many reasons  they increase overall calorie intake, they create inflammation in the body and they disrupt proper insulin levels, contributing to some of the most common chronic health problems of our time: obesity, autoimmunity, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Now it is also recognized that sugar-free and diet colas may be just as dangerous for our health as full-sugar soft drinks. A large study in 2013 showed sugary and diet sodas both significantly increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.7 Harvard Health concludes they also contribute to obesity by tricking the brain into thinking its not tasting sweet things, resulting in even higher cravings for sweet after drinking diet colas (Harvard health). Furthermore, it has been suggested and remains unclear if aspartame increases risk of cancer, urging researchers for more investigation.2 Solution: Cut down or eliminate full-sugar and diet soft drinks form your diet. Some new research suggests replacing these with drinks containing stevia or other sugar alcohols such as xylitol. Although studies show that stevia does not raise insulin levels (a major risk for diabetes) as much as sugar, no long-term studies have been done on these sweeteners, and they have not been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1, 14  Problem: Plastic bottles and containers  Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical present in most plastics and in the lining of canned foods. It is a known endocrine disruptor, meaning it interferes with the bodys hormones and has been clearly linked with negative birth outcomes, infertility, thyroid dysfunction, increased risk of cancer, obesity and insulin resistance.9,15,17 The most sensitive populations to negative effects of chemicals in plastics are pregnant women, children and infants born of women with exposure to BPA during pregnancy. Phthalates are another similarly acting class of chemicals found in plastics. Solution: Because plastics are used ubiquitously in todays world the best solution is to reduce your exposure as much as possible. Use a stainless steel or glass water bottle, purchase products and canned food packaged with a BPA-free liner, use glass Tupperware or use activated charcoal filters for drinking water. This is an important topic to be discussed with your ND.  Problem: Storing Hot food in plastic containers and/or heating food in plastic containers  When heated, plastics begin to break down. The harmful chemicals (discussed above) that are found in plastic leach into food and liquids thereby increasing the harmful hormone-disrupting effect on your body. 9,12 Solution: Use glass or lead-free ceramic containers to reheat food in the oven or heat food on the stove-top. Replace all plastic Tupperware with glass. Dont let plastic wrap touch hot food. Avoid using a microwave as much as possible, but if you choose to use one, make sure all materials are microwave-safe and containers are vented (not totally sealed) before microwaving.  Problem: Non-stick frying pans  For decades, non-stick frying pans have been coated with polytetrafluoroetheylene (PTFE), otherwise known as Teflon. It has been shown that when heated, Teflon releases toxic fumes that can kills birds and cause humans to have flu-like symptoms, coining the term Teflon flu. Manufacturers claim this only occurs when Teflon is over-heated, but tests have shown that toxic fumes are released within 2-5 minutes of conventional stovetop use.6 Chemicals from the same family as Teflon are associated with smaller birth weight and size in newborn babies when pregnant women are exposed, elevated cholesterol, abnormal thyroid hormone levels, liver inflammation and weakened immune defense against disease. Solution: Skip the Teflon! There are much better alternatives. Cast iron pans for example, are not only non-toxic, but they even provide some of your daily iron. Stainless steel pans are also a preferable option. If you already have Teflon pans and want to know how to be safer when using them, be sure to use the fan in the fume hood, use the lowest possible temperature to cook your food, dont heat empty pans as this can cause overheating very quickly and do not use your Teflon pan if it is scratched or damaged in any way.  Probem: Vitamin mineral water  These beverages are marketed as a healthy way to hydrate and get your vitamins, but many brands of vitamin-containing water are loaded with sugar. A bottle of the popular brand Vitaminwater, for example, contains 33g of sugar, almost as much as a can of Coca-Cola which has 38g.16 Other brands use sweeteners or fructose, which are known to disrupt sugar metabolism and alter blood sugar levels and contribute to diabetes and weight gain.8 The consensus is that these drinks confer no added benefit over water and only add calories and sugar to your diet. Solution: Drink lots of filtered water to keep you from getting so dehydrated that you reach for one of these sugary drinks. Splash some lemon or lime into it to get some flavour and vitamin C. Talk with your ND to discuss if your diet is giving you the vitamins you need or if you need individualized vitamin supplementation.  Problem: Microwave use  Microwaves emit a form of non-ionizing radiation (as opposed to x-rays) that vibrates water molecules to create heat. Although microwaves are under strict manufacturing regulation to minimize human exposure to this radiation, older and dirty microwaves and aging door seals can allow for large radiation leakage to reach us.18 Exposure from high leakage can cause DNA damage to our cells and even interfere with some early-model pacemakers. It is unclear whether the radiation changes the nutritional content or alters the safety of the food, unless it is being microwaved in a plastic container, in which case it is more dangerous.13 Solution: When possible, heat foods and liquids on the stove-top or in the oven. If using a microwave, check door seal for safety. Stand in another room when appliance is on, or at least 1.5 meters away. Make sure food containers are uncovered or vented to allow steam to escape and avoid plastics in the microwave.  Problem: Cell phone use (>3hrs/day)  Computers and cell phones also emit non-ionizing radiation into the body and cause DNA damage. A large meta-analysis of cell phone use shows a consistent association between mobile phone use and certain types of brain tumors  with the most amount of time per day using a cell phone correlated with the highest incidence of brain tumors.7 Another study shows the negative effect of radiation on the function of the thyroid gland, pointing to the broad impact of radiation on many tissues in the body.11 When cell phones are used by children, the impact on the brain is two times higher and up to ten times higher in the bone marrow of the skull, compared with adults.4 Solution: Minimize use of a mobile phone for yourself and especially for your children. When possible, use a hands-free Bluetooth device to effectively reduce exposure. Dont carry your cell phone in your pocket and leave it away from you on your desk. Take breaks from computer use and limit desk-time for many health reasons that go beyond limiting radiation. In addition, the stone shungite is purported to protect against radiation and can be worn as a necklace. Also available are electromagnetic frequency (EMF) neutralizers, such as the Bio-dot chips and pendants, designed to scramble non-ionizing radiation enough to reduce DNA damage. We carry the Bio-dot chips at the clinic.  Sources:  Anton, S. D., Martin, C. K., Han, H., Coulon, S., Cefalu, W. T., Geiselman, P., & Williamson, D. A. (2010).

7 Birth Control Options Besides “The Pill”
",http://naturalterrain.com/7-birth-control-options-besides-pill-dr-christina-bjorndal-lachlan-crawford/,"7 Birth Control Options Besides The Pill by Dr. Christina Bjorndal and Lachlan Crawford The combination oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is typically a combination of estrogen and progestin taken orally to prevent female fertility and pregnancy. It was first introduced in 1960 and since then it has undergone many modifications and has been used by millions of women worldwide. Of Canadian women who use contraception, 32% use the OCP as their method of birth control1. It is one of the most used forms of contraception in Canada, but more and more women are looking to alternatives to oral hormonal contraceptive methods. What follows is an overview of some of the most common alternatives to the pill. Birth control is a personal choice and it is your right to be informed of the options available for safe and effective contraception. The Copper IUD (ParaGuard) A copper IUD is a small medical device that is inserted into the uterus and remains there as an effective form of contraception for 5 to 12 years2. This IUD releases copper ions into the uterine cavity that interferes with sperm so that they are no longer viable to travel or to fertilize an egg, although the mechanism for this is not well understood3. Copper IUDs have become more popular in recent years because it is highly effective (only 2% of women will have unplanned pregnancies within the first year), relatively low-maintenance, and cost-effective over the long-term. It contains no hormones and is preferred by women who cannot take hormonal birth control methods. However, copper IUDs can increase cramping, pain and spotting in the first 3-6 months after it is inserted. A woman with a copper IUD will still get her period every month. In fact, the copper IUD is known to increase menstrual bleeding significantly, and has been shown to increase risk of iron-deficiency anemia. For this reason it is not recommended to women with low blood iron, ferritin or hemoglobin4. Different versions of the copper IUD are effective for varying time frames, with the ParaGuard being approved for the longest  10 years. New studies are showing it to be effective at preventing pregnancy for up to 12 years, but should be changed at that point to ensure proper copper levels for efficacy2. Mineral levels in the body are tightly regulated and have significant effects on body processes if levels are too high or too low. In fact, an excess of one mineral can antagonize other minerals and lead to a broader mineral imbalance. Different research groups looking at the effects of the copper IUD have found that blood levels of copper are raised to varying degrees, with newer data suggesting significant increases in serum copper5,6,7. Copper is an essential mineral that is used in many body processes, but at excessive levels it is harmful to the body and negatively impacts the level of other essential mineral. A mineral imbalance caused by an increase in copper affects may physiological systems and can lead to hypothyroidism, emotional lability, problems with memory and concentration, poor blood glucose regulation and an increase in inflammatory conditions8. According to Julie Casper, L. Ac., and Rick Malter, Ph.D., of nutritional balancing.org, symptoms of copper excess include:     Fatigue, exhaustion Headaches, migraines Depression Constipation PMS   Hypothyroidism Pounding heart/palpitations Dry skin Arthritis, calcium spur0s Aching muscles   Concentration and memory problems, brain fog Supersensitive, over-emotional Feelings of loss of control or of hopelessness Recurrent yeast infections Low blood sugar and blood pressure   Chocolate cravings Cold hands/feet Mood swings Eating disorders Obsessive thoughts    As copper increases in the body, potassium levels will be lowered and calcium levels will increase. This shift has a tendency to slow the activity of the thyroid gland. With the lowering of the potassium, the Na/K (sodium: potassium) ratio will increase, thereby putting the individual in a more chronic fight or flight response. Sodium may increase with a corresponding drop in magnesium levels. Therefore, a buildup of excess copper will tend to contribute to more intense feelings of fear and anger in a person. As more and more excess copper builds up, it will lead to a shift from anger and fear to rage and terror or panic. Such intense emotion involving rage and terror or panic will leave such a person feeling out of control. This is a very common reaction of a person with high copper levels.8 Although researchers have not agreed on the possibility of copper toxicity from this contraception device, case studies are pointing to possible adverse effects, from emotional to physical9. Research onhuman copper toxicity remains surprisingly sparse, says Terry Gordon, a professor at New York Universitys department of environmental medicine9. Animal studies show damage to cervical and ovarian cells from high local concentrations of copper ions from the IUD10. Perhaps the most significant study done on this topic on humans showed increased systemic biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and the authors concluded the copper IUD should be used for no more than 2 consecutive years11 as opposed to its usual recommendation of up to 5 years. New research on the etiology of psychological conditions is showing inflammation plays a significant role in the development of mental health concerns. This link shows how copper, inflammation and emotions are all connected. In terms of mineral imbalances, serum Iron levels have been shown to decrease12 likely due to increased blood loss from heavier menstruation, as mentioned above. Serum zinc levels have actually been shown to increase with use of a copper IUD6,12, which is surprising since copper is known to be a zinc antagonist in the body  the mechanism of action of how this occurs remains unknown to researchers. On hypothesis is that serum levels of any mineral other than iron arent meant to be high in the blood as they are used by the body at the tissue level. As such, it would make more sense to analyze mineral deficiencies using a tissue sample (ie hair) or urine source and perhaps the research is misguided because the wrong medium is being measured. It is important to get a good idea of what your chosen method of contraception means for your body in the short and long term. The copper IUD is growing in popularity because of its convenience, effectiveness and absence of hormones, but a broad body of research on it is still lacking. Many women have had successful and satisfactory contraception with the use of a copper IUD. It may still be a good option for you if you are sensitive to other hormonal treatments or prefer it to barrier methods, but it is important to be aware of the link between excess copper, inflammation and emotions. The best suggestion is to get your mineral levels tested by a Naturopathic doctor prior to having an IUD inserted to determine what your pre-existing levels of copper and other essential minerals are. Based on the results, an individualized mineral supplementation program can be created which will help prevent potential side effects that may result after the insertion of the copper IUD. The cost to do a hair essential mineral test is approximately $110. The Hormonal IUD (Mirena) The hormonal IUD, Mirena, is similar to the copper IUD in that it is a small device inserted into the uterus and remains there as long-term birth control for up to 5 years, though like the copper IUD, in some circumstances it may be used for longer. It is designed to release small amounts of a form of the female hormone progestin, like that in the oral contraceptive pill, into the uterus. While it is unclear how this inhibits female fertility, it is thought to work by thickening cervical mucus (to prevent sperm from entering the uterus and reaching or fertilizing an egg) and thinning the lining of the uterus (to make it less hospitable to egg implantation if there is fertilization)13. In the first 3-6 months after insertion, bleeding and spotting may be irregular but over time many women experience lighter and shorter menstrual bleeding than before insertion, however, some may even see a complete cessation in menstruation13. Mirena is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and, like the copper IUD, is low-maintenance and cost-effective over the long term versus other methods of birth control. It does contain the hormone levonorgestrel (progestin), but because it is in the uterus the hormone levels are less than is used in the oral contraceptive pill and is effective without having systemic exposure to synthetic hormones. Less than 1% of women with a Mirena IUD inserted in the last year will become pregnant. However, if pregnancy does occur, it is more likely to be an ectopic pregnancy wherein implantation occurs outside the uterus. This is a potentially life-threatening concern requiring emergency care. Equally unlikely but important to know, the Mirena can also embed itself into or perforate through the lining of the uterus and migrate into the abdomen, causing serious complications requiring surgery. These risks occur in less than 1% of women who are using the Mirena IUD, but they are serious and important to calculate in your decision for birth control. The most common side effects of the Mirena are irregular bleeding (52%), headaches (12%), breast tenderness (3-9%), acne (15%), inflammation of the vulva/vagina (20%), development of ovarian cysts (13%), loss of periods (1-12%), mood changes (4%), and pelvic pain (12%)14. New studies are claiming that it is effective at preventing pregnancy even up to one year after its FDA-approved time of 5 years, though this may result in more difficulty conceiving after its removal15. Use beyond 6 years is not recommended as it may be ineffective and lead to unwanted pregnancy. As there is a chance you may stop your period altogether while using the Mirena, it is a good idea to decide if you feel comfortable with this possibility. Although the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) and the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals (ARHP) state there is no evidence that suppression of periods is harmful, it is important to note that there are no long-term studies to specifically investigate this16,17. Menstruation, contraception and fertility are deeply intimate topics that have been debated by politics and religion for generations. As a result they can hold cultural significance in addition to their biological purpose. Fortunately women now have the ability to choose the significance for themselves and make that a biological reality. For an in-depth discussion of the history, pros and cons of missing periods, please read the article A Brief History of your Period and Why you dont have it by Psychologist Valerie Tarico in the feminist magazine Jezebel. The Ring and The Patch The ring and the patch are two variations on the combined oral contraceptive pill and therefore have much the same risks, side effects and contraindications as the pill18. Products such as the NuvaRing and Evrapatch deliver female hormones (both estrogen and progestin) for three weeks to block ovulation and prevent pregnancy18. The ring is inserted into the vagina whereas the patch is placed on the skin. After three weeks of hormone delivery, the ring or skin patch is removed and allows for a withdrawal bleed that imitates a period, like the oral contraceptive pill. These methods work differently than the Mirena because the method of action is to block ovulation and does not necessarily modify the cervical mucus or uterine lining. With perfect use, both the ring and the patch are 99.7% effective at preventing pregnancy and with typical use, 92%19. The Diaphragm This is a barrier method that involves no hormones and no future impact on fertility. The diaphragm is a flexible latex or silicone dome-shaped device filled with spermicide and inserted into the upper vagina covering the cervix. It creates a spermicidal barrier at the cervical opening and must be used with the spermicidal gel to be effective. Women can insert the diaphragm up to 6 hours before intercourse and should leave it in place for at least 6 hours after (up to 24 hrs)18. If there is more than one occurrence of intercourse in the 24 hours without removal, more spermicidal gel can be added to be sure. Used correctly and consistently, the diaphragm is 94% effective at preventing pregnancy, though with typical use is 84%. For full effectiveness, the diaphragm does require active participation from the woman: proper hygiene habits and regular insertion, cleaning, removal and storage. Using a diaphragm may increase the incidence of urinary tract infections due to the manual insertion and removal. In the past, it needed to be fitted by a physician as well to ensure comfort and effectiveness. Up to 25% of married women in 1955 were using the diaphragm19, but when the birth control pill was introduced and women had the option to have contraception with much less maintenance, the popularity of the diaphragm dropped dramatically. According to the Canadian National Contraception Survey in 2009, only 0.2% of women using contraception choose the diaphragm21. Due to its lowered popularity, there has been limited access to the diaphragm in Canada in recent decades. However, more women are now looking for alternatives to hormonal treatment and the diaphragm is seeing resurgence. New diaphragm products are coming onto the market that are designed to manage some of the drawbacks to the old designs. A new product called Caya, for example, is designed to fit most women and eliminates the need for fitting by a physician. The advantages remain the same as other barrier methods: no hormonal modification or changes to fertility of either party, and the disadvantages are relative to other methods available; the diaphragm requires more active participation from the woman but with proper use is just as effective as using male condoms19. Male condoms, with and without spermicide The use of male condoms is one of the most common methods of birth control. With perfect use it is 98% effective at preventing pregnancy, though this rate drops to 85% with typical use19. Perfect use means applying the condom before any sexual contact, being sure that it does not slip or tear, and removing it immediately after male ejaculation  and this must be done consistently and correctly every single time. Therefore, technique and consistency is key for this method  it requires commitment from both you and your partner to ensure you are both as protected as possible. Using additional spermicidal gel or foam can increase the effectiveness of this method, though its not confirmed exactly how effective typical use with extra spermicidal protection is. The advantage of condoms is that it is hormone-free and also very effective at protecting against sexually transmitted infections and HIV. It is a lifestyle choice that requires engagement from the male partner and can offer opportunity to talk about sexuality, safety and concerns with each other. Note that it is important not to use latex-based lube with latex condoms or to use two condoms at once as both of these may increase the risk of breakage19. Fertility Awareness Method (Rhythm Method) Fertility Awareness is a way to predict your bodys fertile and infertile times during your cycle. Based on the knowledge that the body shows visible and detectable signs of hormonal changes throughout the cycle, a female can know the date of ovulation, and therefore, know when they are fertile and when they are not. During the fertile periods during the cycle, one must abstain completely from sex or use another effective method to prevent pregnancy. This is a wonderful way to get to know your body as you track cycles and get in touch with what is happening and when. It can be extremely effective if you are diligent and consistent. With theoretical perfect use (meaning you are very good at knowing exactly when you ovulate) it is 95-97% effective. However because this method requires consistent and careful monitoring, typical use falls to about 75%19. The fertility awareness method is based on the fact that an egg is released once in each menstrual cycle, usually around mid-cycle, and can live for 12 to 24 hours, waiting to be fertilized before menses flushes out the egg and the uterine lining. Sperm can live in the female reproductive tract up to 6 days and fertilize an egg. Therefore, a female is fertile for as long as six days before ovulation and two or three days after ovulation, a total of seven to eight days of fertility in her cycle each month22. During these fertile days, other contraceptive methods must be used, and outside these days, she is considered infertile and unable to become pregnant. Of course, this method does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. There are different approaches to detecting ovulation that are available to learn, including using a calendar to track cycles, assessing cervical mucous thickness, checking basal body temperature daily, and breast tenderness22. Keep in mind that your cycle itself can vary depending on many factors such as stress, change, trauma, illness and allergic reactions, making it sometimes difficult to be certain of timing. If you are interested in the fertility awareness method, be sure that both you are your partner(s) are committed and there is consistency in the tracking. If done properly this is a natural and effective way to prevent pregnancy. Making an Informed Decision Birth control is an important and intimate decision. If you are looking for alternatives to the oral contraceptive pill, know there are options available for you. Your body does not have to follow any method but what is right for you. Talk with your health care provider about your options, be informed of all the effects of each method and determine what is safe and comfortable for you at this time in your life.

What is the connection between ice and iron deficiency?
",http://naturalterrain.com/connection-ice-iron-deficiency/,"Do You Crave Ice a lot? Its approaching the warmest days of the year and hot drinks are making the transition to iced drinks. We may all want some cooler beverages, but have you noticed you are craving ice much more than usual? Are you chewing ice all the time? Research shows that this is possibly driven by an underlying health condition related to blood iron stores. While not dangerous itself, craving ice could be the first sign of iron-deficiency anemia which can be serious if left untreated. Treating this underlying condition is important, so becoming aware of a strong craving for ice may help you get the treatment you need. The Connection between Ice and Iron This ice craving is more than liking ice in your beverages. It is defined as, an excessive compulsion for chewing ice or consuming iced drinks and when it reaches this level, it is termed pagophagia1. It is most commonly seen in pregnant women and children, though it can be seen at any age and in any gender2. It has also commonly been observed after patients undergo certain types of gastric bypass surgery3,4. Each of these groups who most commonly exhibit pagophagia are known to either have an increased need for iron or a difficulty in absorbing it. This suggests a mysterious link between ice craving and iron. Since initial observations of this phenomenon, many case studies have pointed to the connection between iron-deficiency anemia and eating ice2. The connection is not fully understood, but theories include the relief of inflammation in the mouth and throat caused by iron-deficiency anemia, the perturbation of appetite centers in the brainstem from low blood iron levels, and tissue enzyme deficiencies from missing iron as a cofactor4,5. Although the connection may not be perfectly clear, strong evidence shows that excessive ice cravings are resolved when patients are treated for iron-deficiency anemia2,5. Iron-deficiency anemia Anemia is simply the condition of not having enough red blood cells. The most prevalent form is iron-deficiency anemia which is caused by insufficient free and stored iron in the body2. A key component of healthy red blood cells is hemoglobin, a protein responsible for the transport of oxygen from the lungs to tissues in the body. Iron is required to make hemoglobin, and so a lack of iron will interfere with the bodys ability to make enough hemoglobin and healthy red blood cells for oxygen delivery6. The reasons why someone may not have enough iron to make red blood cells include:  The body is losing more blood cells and iron than it can replace with diet (ex: chronic bleeding disorders or other excessive blood loss due to chronic heavy periods). The body is not absorbing enough iron, either because of poor iron absorption (ex: gastric bypass surgery) or by low dietary intake (ex: prolonged improper diet). The body requires more than normal amounts of iron and is not getting enough through regular diet (ex: childhood and pregnancy).  Iron deficiency anemia is a significant health condition that can affect a persons ability to function. Other symptoms include fatigue, low motivation, mood disturbances, shortness of breath, weakness, restless legs, dizziness, a sore tongue, headaches, hair loss, brittle nails, pale appearance and impaired immune function6,7, 8. A simple way check for potential anemia is to look at the inside of your bottom eyelid: is it very pale? If it is, this could be an indication you need natural iron therapy. Check with your health care provider. It is important to note that there are two types of iron: heme and non-heme. The difference is mainly that heme iron is found in animal products while non-heme is found in leafy greens and other plant sources. About 15-30% of heme iron from animals is absorbed in the human gut, depending on your current iron stores. Meaning, if you are low in iron, you will absorb up to almost a third of what you take in. Sound like a low absorption rate? Unfortunately non-heme iron is even lower, being absorbed only at 2-20% of what is taken in. This absorption rate is less affected by what your stores are like, and more by what other foods and beverages you have in your system at the same time (point 3 below has more information on what affects iron absorption)8. How to Improve Iron Levels Naturally The good news is that iron-deficiency anemia is treatable. Using a range of therapies, blood iron levels and body iron stores can be raised to healthy levels and restore proper cellular functioning, oxygen delivery and energy levels. A good treatment plan must also investigate and address the cause of low ironpoor absorption, poor diet, excessive bleeding, etc.  One of the easiest and most important therapy approaches is through diet. Start by increasing green leafy vegetables in your diet, also red cabbage, parsley, beets, alfalfa, watercress, wheat grass, spinach, cucumbers, tomato juice, fish, coconuts, eggs, black strap molasses, black cherry and blackberry juice. If you are not a strict vegan or vegetarian, consider consuming organic red meat especially when you know you are losing blood (for example, during menses). An important addition for iron therapy is supplementation. There are many different forms of supplements and some are better absorbed than others so it is advised to speak with a naturopathic doctor to determine the best one for you. Pay attention to other things that may be affecting your iron levels. Some tips9:   Taking iron with vitamin C helps absorption, speeding up results for iron therapy Taking digestive enzymes may help you absorb better as well, especially if you have problems digesting dairy and protein properly Taking antacid tablets with calcium can interfere with iron absorption and lead to iron deficiency Coffee, tea and wine contain polyphenols can also reduce the absorption of iron in the gut Low folic acid and B12 levels can look like iron-deficiency anemia, so it might be necessary for you to also supplement with these nutrients. Low stomach acid levels may contribute to low iron by decreasing your ability to digest foods properly. You may want to check with your health care provider. Minerals (calcium, zinc and copper) can affect the absorption of iron so it is best to take your iron supplement with Vitamin C and away from other supplements that contain minerals Phytic acid found in grains, leafy greens, soy and other legumes can inhibit iron absorption Last but not least, parasites in the body can also drastically reduce iron levels. If there is any chance you have picked up a parasite, its eradication is essential to reversing iron-deficiency anemia.  These pointers are here to help you begin to think about how many aspects of your health are connected: how diet, supplementation, and other factors can affect iron levels and therefore cause you to crave ice or have other symptoms of anemia. Be empowered and learn about your body and your habits, but also be sure to discuss with a trusted health care practitioner how you can address this. Iron-deficiency anemia is indicated by many symptoms  from eating ice to brittle nails  but once it is caught, it can be treated to help you move towards a more energetic and healthy way of living.

How hormones affect ovarian cysts by Dr. Chris Bjorndal
",http://naturalterrain.com/hormones-affect-ovarian-cysts-dr-chris-bjorndal/,"It was reported recently in People Magazine that Lena Durham was hospitalized due to a ruptured ovarian cyst.1 Unfortunately, her story is all too common. I often say to patients that most health concerns relating to our menstrual cycle  which can range from ovarian cysts, to heavy, difficult or painful periods, to no periods, to fibroids, to fertility issues and all the way to menopause  are not exactly medical conditions that need to be treated with a suppressive therapy such as the birth control pill. Instead, they are signs from your body that your hormones are out of balance. The work that needs to be done is in balancing the hormonal system to alleviate these messages typically referred to as symptoms. Types of ovarian cysts Ovarian cysts are fluid filled sacs that develop on the ovaries. In Lena Durhams case, she developed a type of ovarian cyst called an endometrioma which is secondary to endometriosis.3 In endometriosis, endometrial tissue migrates outside the uterine cavity and attaches to other organs, such as the ovaries. A growth forms which becomes an endometrioma cyst. There are two other common types of ovarian cysts (follicle and corpus luteum cysts) that can form during a normal menstrual cycle and tend to go away on their own. Follicle cysts.In a normal menstrual cycle, the ovaries release an egg each month. The egg grows inside a tiny sac called a follicle. When the egg matures, the follicle breaks open to release the egg. Follicle cysts form when the follicle doesnt break open to release the egg. This causes the follicle to continue growing into a cyst. Follicle cysts often have no symptoms and go away in one to three months.2  Corpus luteum cysts.Once the follicle breaks open and releases the egg, the empty follicle sac shrinks into a mass of cells called the corpus luteum which makes hormones to prepare for the next egg in the menstrual cycle. Corpus luteum cysts form if the sac doesnt shrink. Instead, the sac reseals itself after the egg is released, and then fluid builds up inside. Most corpus luteum cysts go away after a few weeks.2  Follicle and corpus luteum cysts are referred to as physiological or functional in nature because they form a function in the body.4 In addition to endometriomas, there are three other types of ovarian cysts (dermoid, cystadenoma and polycystic ovarian syndrome) which are considered pathological in nature because they dont serve a function in the body:  Dermoidscome from cells present from birth and do not usually cause symptoms. Cystadenomasare filled with watery fluid and can sometimes grow large. Polycystic ovaries. These cysts are caused when eggs mature within the little balloons but are not released. The cycle then repeats. The sacs continue to grow and many cysts form. This can result In irregular periods and difficulty getting pregnant if not treated.4  It is important to note that most ovarian cysts are often not malignant and they are a result of menstruation. If you are postmenopausal and experience the symptoms listed below it is important to visit your doctor as postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts are at higher risk for ovarian cancer.2 What you might experience With ovarian cysts, you do not always experience symptoms because many cysts are small. If the cysts grow to a larger size, you may experience intermittent pain that is sharp or dull in nature in the lower abdomen on the side of the cyst, as well as pressure and bloating.2 Less common symptoms include2:  Pelvic pain Dull ache in the lower back and thighs Problems emptying the bladder or bowel completely Pain during sex Unexplained weight gain Pain during your period Unusual (not normal) vaginal bleeding Breast tenderness Needing to urinate more often  In the extreme case of a cyst rupturing, you will experience sudden, severe pain. If a cyst causes twisting of an ovary,you may have pain along with nausea and vomiting. What you can do about ovarian cysts If you think you might have ovarian cysts, the first step is to talk to your doctor. If a cyst is found after doing a pelvic exam, your doctor may send you for an ultrasound or hormone level tests. The solution for ovarian cysts from a conventional medical perspective is to manage pain with medication or to prescribe the birth control pill. The National Institute of Health estimates that 5% to 10% of women have surgery to remove an ovarian cyst and this would occur if your cyst:  Does not go away after several menstrual cycles Gets larger Looks unusual on the ultrasound Causes pain  It is important to understand that there are natural alternatives to taking medication (either pain medication or the birth control pill). It is important to address the underlying causes of hormone imbalances that can lead to ovarian cysts. We have to realize that we need to work with our hormones to do all that we can to avoid surgery. And to truly manage our hormones, we cant rely on pills. We have to deal with the root causes of food and lifestyle choices that are creating havoc with our hormones. Here are some next steps to take and what you need to be aware of:  Xenoestrogens from the environment affect the levels of estrogen in our bodies. When estrogen is too high, it can promote the formation of ovarian cysts. Endocrine disruptors may be found in many everyday products  including plastic bottles, metal food cans, detergents, flame retardants, food, toys, cosmetics and pesticides.5 To reduce your exposure to pesticides, start by eating as many of the following foods organic6: apples, peaches, nectarines, strawberries, grapes, celery, spinach, bell peppers, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, imported snap peas and potatoes (yes, that includes French fries J). Our liver is a key organ involved in the break down and elimination of estrogen from our body.7 If our diets are devoid of key nutrients required to break down estrogen, it may build up in our system and stimulate a cyst to grow.8 To support your liver and promote the elimination of estrogen from your body, increase the amount of cruciferous vegetables in your diet (ie broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussel sprouts), decrease refined sugar and limit coffee and alcohol. Your lifestyle affects how your hormones function. It is important to determine whether poor eating habits, lack of sleep, lack of exercise or excessive stress levels may be affecting your hormone balance. Remember that positive change happens in small increments. Pick one area that you can improve on to support your hormonal health.  When your hormonal system is in out of balance, it can cause a domino effect, producing more symptoms, secondary conditions, and even autoimmune issues. Remember to work with your naturopathic doctor to determine what the underlying root causes are for you as an individual.  http://www.people.com/article/lena-dunham-hospitalized-for-endometriosis-complications http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/ovarian-cysts.htm http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lena-dunham-endometriosis_us_56ddc24ce4b0000de4054fd1 http://www.cmdrc.com/womens-health/ovarian-cysts/http://www.cmdrc.com/womens-health/ovarian-cysts/ http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/ http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php http://jncimono.oxfordjournals.org/content/2000/27/113.full  http://www.womensinternational.com/connecti How hormones affect ovarian cysts by Dr. Chris Bjorndal was last modified:  September 18th, 2016 by Dr. Chris"

Caffeine – is it healthy?
",http://naturalterrain.com/caffeine-is-it-healthy/,"Is coffee part of your morning routine? Are you convinced that it is good for you? Have you ever considered that it might not be? Everything in moderation, right? Since the explosion of Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Second Cup, the popularity of caffeine has led people to turn a blind eye to its harmful health effects. Now the dangers are clear and it is hard to refute that there are many symptoms generated by this addictive substance. I am often met with resistance when I ask people to eliminate caffeine (in all forms) from their diet. However, once I explain the harmful effects of caffeine and the benefits of lowering or eliminating it from their lifestyle compliance increases. A colleague explained caffeines effects on the body in this useful analogy: Imagine you have a pair of soaked sponges. They are so full that the minute you pick them up, they spill over with excess water. These are your healthy adrenal glands that are spilling over with energy producing and stress-regulating hormones, such as cortisol. With each event in your life, you start to squeeze the sponges little by little:       Teenage years & parties University stress/cramming for exams College parties Finding a job after graduation Starting a career        Buying a car Moving and buying a home Dating Planning a wedding & honeymoon Work promotions        Having a child Having a 2nd child Divorce Death of a loved one Moving, etc.       If you dont take time to recharge your batteries, or in this case refill your sponges, they will slowly start to dry out. When daily tasks become major stressors and you fall into a reactive mindset, caffeine can save the day. Caffeine does a fantastic job at squeezing your sponges (ie stimulating your adrenal glands) to release more water (ie produce more stress regulating hormones). Unfortunately, when youre in survival mode you are often not taking the time to properly rest, eat healthy and nourish your adrenals. As a result, your sponges dry out even more. Instead of 1 cup of coffee in the morning, you now need 3 cups to wring out the last few drops of adrenaline/cortisol until you eventually reach adrenal fatigue. Your body is no longer able to function properly and you can physically collapse. This is often seen after someone finishes a big project, goes out to celebrate and within days finds themselves sick.1 The above analogy demonstrates the physiological effects of caffeine. It is important to recognize that caffeine is an addictive substance and that it can be a slippery slope into the dependency pit of addiction. A few questions to ask are:  Why do you need caffeine? Is it a pick me up because you are tired? If so, have you addressed why are tired? If you have problems sleeping, is it possible that caffeine is disturbing your sleep? Can you go without caffeine without experiencing withdrawal symptoms?  I am asking these questions so you think about your behaviour. Listen, I get it, we all do things that arent good for us and the key word in life is balance. I find it interesting when people are so proud that they dont drink coffee but they eat a ton of chocolate, drink pop (both of which have hidden caffeine), eat sugar-laden foods or drink too much alcohol. My goal as a health care provider is to assess your diet to see if what you are consuming on a daily basis is contributing to your health issues or supporting vitality. It is important to remember that everything that passes into your body informs your body. You are made of nutritional building blocks  such as water, vitamins, minerals and fats  and some of these nutrients are ESSENTIAL. This means that we cant make them ourselves  we must get them from our diet  and if we dont, we will be deficient. My husband who, is also an ND, is anti-coffee. When we practiced in Fort McMurray, word spread that he recommended patients to eliminate coffee. Some patients preferred to see me instead of him for that reason! What they didnt know is that, depending on your individual health concerns, I may also have recommended that you quit coffee. Lets look at the list of potential side effects from overuse of caffeine:   Negative Influence on Vitamins and Minerals:2  Caffeines diuretic effect depletes important minerals (ie calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron etc) and vitamins (Vitamin B1 (thiamine), Vitamin C) Coffee reduces absorption of iron and calcium & vitamin D, especially when it is consumed around mealtime. These minerals are extremely important as deficiencies can lead to osteoporosis and anemia. In children and adolescents, caffeinated drinks interfere with essential minerals needed for growth and development.   GI irritation:3  As little as 1 cup of coffee stimulates acid secretion in the stomach for more than an hour in a healthy individual. In someone with an ulcer, the effect is greater and lasts more than two hours. Long term use of caffeine can play a role in ulcer formation. It can aggravate an existing ulcer4 and interferes with the healing process Diarrhea can also occur with the overuse of caffeine, which relaxes the smooth muscle in the colon. The laxative effect of caffeine can also create a bowel dependency   Cardiovascular system effects:  Caffeine raises blood pressure5. Hypertension is a risk factor in atherosclerosis and heart disease. Caffeine increases blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides which are risk factors in cardiovascular disease. Heart rhythm disturbances and arrhythmias6 can occur with caffeine. Disturbances include an increased heart rate and excitability of the heart nerve conduction system, leading to both palpitations and extra beats. Caffeine also increases norepinephrine secretion which causes constriction of arteries leading to restricted blood flow. Because of the cardiovascular stimulation of caffeine, it seems reasonable to assume that long term consumption of four to five cups of coffee per day can increase the incidence of heart attacks (myocardial infarction).   Central nervous system (CNS) effects:7  Caffeine is a CNS stimulant  it works by blocking the effects of adenosine, which is a substance that is created in the brain. Adenosine binds to its receptors and slows down nerve cells. This causes drowsiness and blood vessels to increase in diameter to let more oxygen in during sleep. Caffeine has a similar shape to adenosine and binds to its receptors, but it has a stimulating effect and speeds up nerve cells thereby increasing energy. Common CNS side effects of caffeine use include: nervousness, irritability, insomnia, restless legs, dizziness, headaches and fatigue. Psychological symptoms of depression, general anxiety or panic attacks may also occur. Hyperactivity and bed wetting may also develop in children who consume caffeine. Addictions: Experiments with animals show when coffee is added to the diet, animals voluntarily drank more alcohol than the amount consumed without coffee. Caffeine enters the blood and can have effects 15 minutes after it is consumed. It then takes about 6 hours for one half of the caffeine to be eliminated.   The exhausting effects of caffeine:8  Caffeine increases blood sugar levels (especially when it is sweetened) by stimulating the adrenal glands. Over time, both stress, caffeine and sugar consumption weakens adrenal function resulting in fatigue8,9. Because of tiredness, people turn to caffeine for that morning pick me up as caffeine can override this fatigue by stimulating the adrenals. The problem is that over time this contributes to chronic fatigue, adrenal exhaustion and subsequent inability to handle stress and sugar intake. As such, adrenal exhaustion/stress/fatigue/hypoglycemia syndrome is associated with caffeine use.   Cancer-causing effects:  The incidence of bladder, prostate, ovarian, stomach and pancreatic cancers is increased with caffeine use.  Bladder cancer is aggravated by the combination of nicotine and caffeine due to the mild dehydration that results from the use of these two drugs. Ovarian cancer is increased in women with an association of long-term coffee intake. Pancreatic cancer has also been in question as occurring more frequently with increased coffee use (more than 3 cups per day)10. Prostate enlargement and cancer may also be attributed to increased caffeine intake. There is a higher incidence of stomach cancer with more than five cups per day.     Other effects:  Kidneys: Caffeine is also correlated with kidney stones, possibly as a result of its diuretic effect and of the effects of chemicals used in processing coffee.11 Fibrocystic breast disease may also be a consequence of caffeine use as there is an increase in the size and number of cysts with caffeine consumption.12 A reduction/reversal of the condition is experienced when caffeine is eliminated from the diet.         Common Symptoms of Caffeine Abuse       Agitation Anxiety/Nervousness Bed wetting Depression Diarrhea Dizziness Fatigue        Gastrointestinal irritation Headache Heartburn Increased blood pressure Increased cholesterol & triglycerides Increased or irregular heart rate Insomnia        Irritability Nutritional deficiencies Poor concentration Tremors Ulcers Upset stomach       Common Symptoms of Caffeine Withdrawal       Anxiety/ Nervousness Apathy Constipation Cramps Craving Depression Digestive upset        Dizziness Drowsiness/Fatigue Feeling cold Headache Insomnia Irritability Nausea        Poor concentration Rapid heart rate Ringing in the ears Runny nose Shakiness Vomiting       Common Symptoms of Caffeine Withdrawal      What Foods Contain Caffeine? 13    Caffeine Amount     Coffee 8 oz 95-150 mg, varies depending on the roasting and grinding. Dark roasts tend to have less caffeine than lighter roasts, but it is a subtle difference.14   Decaf 8 oz 2  12 mg   Green Tea  8oz 24  45 mg   Black Tea  8oz 14  70 mg   Hot Chocolate  8 oz 8 mg   Soda/Pop  12oz (1 can) 46 mg   Cocoa/Chocolate 50g 3  63 mg   Excedrin 65 mg   Anacin 32 mg   Midol 32 mg   Dristan 16 mg   Guarana root15 3.6%  5.8% by weight   Kola nut16 2.0%  3.5% by weight   Yerba mate tea  8 oz17 85 mg        How Much Caffeine is Safe?      300 mg/day is thought to be a moderate daily intake and it not linked to any negative health effects; however, we often recommend drinking less than this.  PREGNANCY AND CAFFEINE18  Although research is conflicting, there is enough evidence that large daily doses of caffeine are harmful in pregnancy. Therefore, we recommend eliminating caffeine if trying to conceive or in pregnancy until more research is done. Some studies have shown that caffeine intake of more than 300mg/day can cause delayed conception. Birth Defects have been noted with higher levels of caffeine use during pregnancy. Caffeine crosses the placenta and affects the fetus as it has mutagenic effects (ie it breaks chromosomes in nuclei of cells and interferes with the repair of DNA). Strong evidence that large daily caffeine consumption may increase miscarriage, preterm delivery and low birth weight (especially when infants are premature). Caffeine easily passes from mom to fetus through the placenta. Due to the immature fetal organs, the fetus may have a harder time breaking down caffeine. Even moderate amounts of caffeine can increase fetal heart rate and movement patterns.  Maternal Effects  Hydration is important in pregnancy since blood volume increases. Since caffeine acts to increase urination, it therefore decreases body fluids and blood volume. A pregnant womens ability to break down caffeine slows down as pregnancy progresses. Breastfeeding: High caffeine intake by a nursing mother can cause the baby to be irritable and have disturbed sleep cycles.  Ways to decrease caffeine intake  Cut back gradually  keep a log of how much caffeine you consume (remember to include medications), then gradually decrease coffee by 1 cup/day Substitute with herbal tea, hot cider, or healthy coffee substitutes Ask others to decrease coffee intake with you as there is strength in numbers Dilute your regular coffee with hot water Drink lattes with more milk than coffee Brew tea/coffee for less time Change routines  for example, if you need caffeine in the morning to give you a boost, try a light walk for 20min  physical activity can greatly increase energy levels. Ensure you are drinking the minimum water requirement which is  your body weight in ounces  for example, if you weight 180lbs, your minimum water amount is 90oz or 3L. Remember that coffee is a diuretic so depending on how many cups your are drinking per day, you may be in a negative water balance and most likely need to consume more.

8 steps to reduce your family’s exposure to BPA
",http://naturalterrain.com/bisphenol-a/,"1. What is BPA? In recent years, many studies have shown that significant levels of toxic substances can leach from the every day items used in our homes and workplaces. We are now into the fourth generation of people exposed to toxic chemicals from before conception through to adulthood, and statistics tell us that we are under siege. Children born today face a greater chance of developing at least one or more of the following health conditions  ADD/ADHD, Autism spectrum disorders, learning disabilities, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and infertility  which have been linked with pre- and post-natal exposure to toxic chemicals. This article will take a closer look at one toxic chemical found in your homes  BPA. Bisphenol A, or BPA, is an industrial chemical used to make two common synthetics:  Polycarbonate plastic: a clear, rigid, shatter-resistant plastic found in a wide variety of consumer products (ie food and drink containers, CDs, DVDs, water bottles, drinking glasses, kitchen appliances and utensils, eyeglass lenses, office water coolers, hockey helmet visors, medical supplies, cell phones, computers, toys and car headlights). Epoxy resins: used in industrial adhesives and high-performance coatings. They are used as adhesives in sporting equipment, airplanes and cars. They are also found in dental filling materials, protective coatings around wire and piping and line the interior of every tin can found in every home and grocery store. Additional sources of BPA include carbonless paper  the white, glossy, coated paper that most cash register receipts are printed on; newspaper ink; and since newspapers are used in making recycled paper, levels of BPA in recycled paper is extremely high (ie pizza boxes made from recycled paper).  2. What are the health risks of BPA?  BPA is a synthetic estrogen that is disruptive to our endocrine system. It has been linked to a wide variety of health conditions, including infertility, obesity, diabetes, early puberty, behavioral changes in children, resistance to chemotherapy treatments and breast, prostate and reproductive system cancers.  3. BPA reaches the developing fetus  Surveys by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention have found BPA in nearly every person over the age of 6. In 2009, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) detected BPA in 90% of cord blood samples. Most of this contamination is believed to come from food packaging. BPA molecules leach into food and beverages from plastic food containers and the epoxy linings of metal cans. In 2007, the Canadian government was the first to ban BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups due to pressure from consumers and environmental groups. While this was a big step forward, the government still allows BPA in canned foods, store and bank receipts and dental glue. EWG advises consumers to limit their consumption of canned products or to use products made by companies that provide BPA-free lining, such as Eden Organics. In 2007, EWG found BPA in 53 of 97 canned foods tested. In 2011, tests of 78 popular canned foods found BPA in 90 percent of products. The following canned foods measure high in BPA: beans, green beans, green peas and chili. There are low concentrations of BPA in canned fruit and beverages. In 2011, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health determined that volunteers who ate a single serving of canned soup a day for five days had ten times the amount of BPA in their bodies as when they ate fresh soup daily. Campbells and other major canned food makers are seeking alternatives but have not yet switched to BPA-free cans.  4. How to limit your familys exposure to BPA Completely eliminating contact with BPA is virtually impossible, but you can reduce your familys exposure to this chemical by making the changes below.  Use fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible. Alternatively select products that are packaged in glass or cardboard containers or that have been frozen when fresh. BPA leaches from containers into the contents and we end up consuming it. Containers do not need to be heated for this to occur. Switch to glass or stainless steel containers where possible. With respect to baby formula, choose powdered formula because the packaging contains less BPA. If your baby needs liquid formula, look for brands sold in non-plastic containers. Limit your consumption of canned food, particularly if you are pregnant. Look for canned food labeled as BPA-free or buy food packed in glass jars or waxed cardboard cartons. A few companies sell cans lined with non-BPA alternatives, such as Eden Organics. Store food in non-toxic alternatives such as glass or stainless steel. BPA leaches from containers into the contents and we end up consuming it. Containers do not need to be heated for this to occur. Switch to glass or stainless steel containers where possible. Do not microwave your leftovers in polycarbonate or plastic containers  use glass containers instead. Do not use a plastic lid cover in the microwave to prevent food from spraying. Better yet, dont use a microwave Watch receipts  In 2010, EWGs testing of retailers store receipts found that 40 percent were coated with BPA. The chemical can rub off on hands or food items. Some may be absorbed through the skin. Limit exposure by: 1) saying no to receipts when possible 2)Keep receipts in an envelope 3) Never give a child a receipt to hold or play with. 4) Wash your hands before preparing and eating food after handling receipts. 5) Do not recycle receipts and other thermal paper. BPA residues will contaminate recycled paper.

A Naturopathic Approach to Fertility and Pregnancy
",http://naturalterrain.com/a-naturopathic-approach-to-fertility-and-pregnancy/,"The question heard by most couples after they get married is When are you going to have a baby? For some, the road to parenthood is easy and for others, there can be a few bumps along the way. It becomes even more frustrating when you hear that people with poor habits (ie drinking, smoking and eating poorly) get pregnant on the notorious first try while you might be a healthy person who watches everything that goes into your body, yet you cannot seem to conceive. From irregular periods, difficult PMS, heavy periods, fertility and menopause the answer found in most doctors offices is some form of one size fits all pill in the form of synthetic hormones that either suppress the natural rhythm of our bodies or supercharges it.  My personal feeling is that most conditions that relate to our menstrual cycles are hormone imbalances that can be regulated by balancing and supporting our neuroendocrine system which consists of our hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal glands, thyroid gland and ovaries. Each of these glands produce hormones that affect the other and it is the intricate dance of balance between our master glands (ie pituitary and hypothalamus), adrenal hormones (cortisol and DHEA), female hormones (FSH, LH, the estrogens and progesterone) and our thyroid gland that affect whether we will conceive. The other key organs that need to be supported to be hormonally healthy are the primary organs of detoxification (ie liver, kidneys, colon, lungs and skin). This is especially important in recent years with the increase of chemical, emotional and physical stress bombarding our bodies  these influences are contributing to declining fertility rates and need to be addressed in couples. A Naturopathic approach to fertility is based on the principle of bringing a couples health back in balance. With naturopathic care, your entire health history is assessed. I help my patients get in tune with their body and menstrual cycle. It is amazing how many patients arent sure if they ovulate and/or dont even know the length of their menstrual cycle. In Naturopathic Medicine, it is our philosophy to treat the cause, to figure out what is going on, and correct any underlying hormonal imbalances. From there, we use the healing powers of nature to balance the body by optimizing nutrition, eliminating stressors in ones lifestyle, learning about your cycle and treating underlying health conditions. Some basic tips to enhance fertility are:  GET IN TUNE WITH YOUR BODY- Find out when you are ovulating. Many women think this is on Day 14 (with Day 1 being the first day of flow); however, often it is not. Depending on the length of your cycle it could be much sooner or much later. Watch cervical flow to be like egg whites, this is when you are the most fertile. Check your body temperature for a slight elevation (a.k.a. basal body temperature), and pay attention to cramping. HEALTHY DIET AND LIFESTYLE- Eat a healthy diet consisting of 5 vegetable servings, 2-3 servings of fruit, nuts and seeds, and adequate protein for your weight. Avoid alcohol, sugar, fried food and junk food. Get lots of sleep and deal with stress  practice healthy lifestyle techniques such as exercise, yoga, relaxation exercises, deep breathing etc. USE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY SUPPLEMENTS- It is important to be on a good quality prenatal vitamin with folic acid and essential fatty acids. It is best to seek a professional opinion, as there are many poor quality products on the market BE ASSESSED FOR A HORMONAL BALANCE- I always run hormone testing on patients if they have been trying for over 3 months. Conventional blood work (estrogen and LH: FSH ratio on Day 3 and progesterone on Day 21) is combined with salivary hormone testing. If levels are low, I use diet, herbs, supplements, acupuncture and homeopathic remedies to balance the levels. It is also important to assess the basics in womens health such as: folic acid, B12, thyroid function, and vitamin/ mineral status in iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iodine and selenium. For the other half:SPERM QUALITY & QUANTITY- Sperm quality is essential  zinc, coenzyme Q10 and a good quality fish oil is key. Keep these guys cool, so avoid hot tubs and laptops on your lap!  Whether you have been labeled with endometriosis, PCOS, low sperm counts, hormonal imbalances, irregular menstrual cycles, and other unexplained fertility concerns, Naturopathic Medicine can help you. Patients who are preparing for IVF, IUI or other fertility treatments are encouraged to combine naturopathic support for increased success. Trying to conceive can be an emotional roller coaster that takes its toll on a person psychologically and physically, and can be a huge burden financially. Consulting with a Naturopathic Doctor who is dedicated to helping individuals and couples improve their health and fertility can be the piece that solves the fertility puzzle.

What to expect from your Naturopathic Doctor By Dr. Chris
",http://naturalterrain.com/expect-naturopathic-doctor-dr-chris/,"I believe that everyone has within him/herself the power to become completely well. There is, in our planet, and within each one of us, a natural healing power. As we begin to come into harmony with its laws, this healing power will bring us steadily towards complete physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. As your naturopathic doctor, it is my responsibility to make sure that you have the information and guidance that you need to move from where you are now towards better health. I take this responsibility seriously and I know that naturopathic medicine can help you. You dont have to be sick to feel better. A naturopathic program is insurance for the future. You can begin to feel better now and you can reduce the likelihood of suffering and illness later in life. Naturopathic medicine involves you as a participant You will find that I listen very carefully to what you have to say. I want to be sure that I understand why you came to see me. After I have gathered sufficient information through questionnaires, a complaint oriented physical exam and by listening, I will make suggestions based on my findings. Then we will discuss your situation and a treatment plan will be outlined. We will work together to meet your health goals. Follow up appointments are to be scheduled to reassess your condition and progress. The cost of naturopathic health care is a concern for most people, but the truth is you cannot put a price on health. When you invest in your health, you broaden your horizons and open up opportunities for success in life. No expenditure is a better investment for a successful future. If you currently experience good health, you may not notice any dramatic short-term gains. The goal, however, is to learn how to maintain your health as you grow older, for nobody can deny the incalculable difference between a future spent glowing in vital health and one spent suffering from degenerative disease. The sooner you begin to learn and apply the principles of naturopathic health care, the greater your prospects for a healthier and happier future as you age. Naturopathic health care is for those who want to take control of their lives and their health. It is for those who want to understand which actions and attitudes contribute to better health and which detract from it so that they can make positive choices. Naturopathic medicine is concerned with identifying and treating the underlying causes of disease and ill-health. Each person is complex and this process of discovery is necessarily a gradual one. Deep-rooted conditions take time to uncover, but if there is progress  that is, if you are starting to feel better and have a better understanding of yourself, and you are feeling more in control of your life and your health  then you will know that it is worthwhile to continue. NDs do place the highest priority on relieving your pain and discomfort as speedily as possible, but they know that the suppression of symptoms gives only temporary relief. Long-term gains are made only by addressing underlying causes. I will discuss your options with you so that you can make choices consistent with your short-term needs as well as your long-term goals. Naturopathy is aimed at identifying and managing stress. Stressors may be structural, chemical, biological, mental or emotional in origin, but no matter what the source, the stressor should be identified, acknowledged and then strategies worked out to manage that stressor in a way thatis acceptable to you and compatible with your lifes goals. As your ability to manage stress effectively improves, your immune system will begin to function better. Your resistance to all types of disease will improve and the complaints you presently have will get better. Naturopathic doctors treat acute conditions. NDs are trained in emergency medicine, but will always refer people to the appropriate emergency medical care when the situation warrants it. There are, however, many unpleasant acute conditions for which we can offer help to you and your family as NDs are trained to be primary care physicians. Many distressing conditions affecting children and adults can be quickly improved to help you avoid pain, loss of sleep, loss of work and anxiety. Naturopathic remedies are healthful  they work in harmony with your body and have few side effects. Dont hesitate to call for an acute appointment  we have four NDs available to serve you. . Naturopathic health care is for children. Naturopathic health care is for children as well as young people and adults. The sooner you act to safeguard and maintain the natural pristine health of a newborn baby, the fewer the problems later on. You can do no greater service for your children than to support their health and give them an informed healthy start to life. Our contemporary environment  our culture and belief systems, as well as our physical environment  generates stressors of many kinds which affect your children. The impressions created by commercial interests and the media as to what constitutes a good diet for your child can often lead to erroneous beliefs. A deeper knowledge of nutrition can make a significant difference to your childs present and future health. As NDs, we like to teach our patients about the many factors that can impact your childs health and how to better manage these influences. Naturopathic health care is different. Some of the concepts which you will encounter in our clinic will be new to you, but we will always take the time to explain to you the reasons behind the things we will be doing and may also recommend some reading material. Perhaps the most different, and for many the most challenging aspect of naturopathy, is that patients are encouraged to participate in their recovery and health promotion. Many conditions can be treated with minimal participation on your part, but the results in terms of your ongoing freedom from illness and distress are achieved when you are actively involved. The doctor as teacher. Docere, the Latin word for to teach is the origin of our word, doctor. One of thegoals of NDs is to be educators  to share with you a broad and objective view of the factors which affect your health. NDs reach deeply into scientific and medical research. In addition, we study traditional healing knowledge from around the world. As a result, we can offer you principles for healthy living as well as specific solutions for specific problems. The emphasis is to provide you and your family members with knowledge and understanding  the essential tools necessary for you to progress confidently towards better health. One side benefit, which may appeal to you, is that living according to naturopathic principles is holistic and benefits not just the people who practice it, but the whole planet, too. To schedule an appointment please call 587-521-3595  we look to serving you.   What to expect from your Naturopathic Doctor By Dr. Chris was last modified:  December 5th, 2016 by Dr. Chris"

10 tips for mental health
",http://naturalterrain.com/ten-tips-for-mental-health/,"When your mental health is in check it means that you have a sense of wellbeing, are able to function in your daily life and feel confident in your abilities. As with your physical health, there are steps you can take to increase your mental health and boost your wellbeing by following these suggestions.  Connect with others. Develop and maintain strong relationships with people who will support and enrich your life. The quality of our personal relationships has a great effect on our wellbeing. Putting time and effort into building strong relationships can bring great rewards. Take time to enjoy. Set aside time for activities, hobbies, and projects you enjoy. Let yourself be spontaneous and creative if the urge strikes you. Do a crossword, take a walk in the park, read a book, go to the library, start an art project, draw pictures with your kids, play with your pets  whatever takes your fancy. Participate and share interests. Join a club or group of people who share your interests. Being part of a group of people with a common interest provides a sense of belonging and is good for your mental health. Join a sports club, a band; an evening walk group, a dance class, a theatre or choir group, a book or car club. Contribute to your community. Volunteer your time for a cause or issue that you care about. Help out a neighbour, work in a community garden or do something nice for a friend. There are many great ways to contribute that can help you feel good about yourself and your place in the world. An effort to improve the lives of others is sure to improve your life too. Take care of yourself. Be active and eat well  these help maintain a healthy body. Physical and mental health are closely linked; its easier to feel good about life if your body feels good. You dont have to go to the gym to exercise  gardening, vacuuming, dancing and hiking all count. Combine physical activity with a balanced diet to nourish your body and mind and keep you feeling good, inside and out. Challenge yourself. Learn a new skill or take on a challenge to meet a goal. You could take on something different at work, commit to a fitness goal or learn to cook a new recipe. Learning improves your mental fitness, while striving to meet your own goals, builds skills and confidence and gives you a sense of progress and achievement. Deal with stress. Be aware of what triggers your stress and how you react. You may be able to avoid some of the triggers and learn to prepare for or manage others. Stress is a part of life and affects people in different ways. It only becomes a problem when it makes you feel uncomfortable or distressed. A balanced lifestyle can help you manage stress better. If you have trouble winding down, you may find that relaxation breathing, yoga or meditation can help. Rest and refresh. Get plenty of sleep. Go to bed at a regular time each day and practice good habits to get better sleep. Sleep restores both your mind and body. However, feelings of fatigue can still set in if you feel constantly rushed and overwhelmed when you are awake. Allow yourself some unfocused time each day to refresh; for example, let our mind wander, daydream or simply watch the clouds go by for a while. Its OK to add do nothing to your to-do-list! Notice the here and now. Take a moment to notice each of your senses each day. Simply be in the moment  feel the sun and wind on your face and notice the air you are breathing. Its easy to be caught up thinking about the past or planning for the future instead of experiencing the present. Practicing mindfulness, by focusing your attention on being in the moment, is a good way to do this. Making a conscious effort to be aware of your inner and outer world is important for your mental health. Ask for help. This can be as simple as asking a friend to babysit while you have some time out or speaking to your Naturopathic doctor or Medical doctor. You may need additional counseling support. Instead of worrying, affirm the outcome you want to have happen and focus your attention on that. There are bumps along the road of life for everyone and there are people who can help you. If you dont get the help you need first off, keep asking until you do.   10 tips for mental health was last modified:  February 4th, 2016 by Dr. Chris"

Healthy gift ideas: Introducing the bioDOT

What to Expect from your Naturopathic Doctor
",http://naturalterrain.com/what-to-expect-from-your-naturopathic-doctor/,"What to expect from your Naturopathic Doctor I believe that everyone has within him/herself the power to become completely well. There is, in our planet, and within each one of us, a natural healing power. As we begin to come into harmony with its laws, this healing power will bring us steadily towards complete physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. As your naturopathic doctor, it is my responsibility to make sure that you have the information and guidance that you need to move from where you are now towards better health. I take this responsibility seriously and I know that naturopathic medicine can help you. You dont have to be sick to feel better. A naturopathic programme is insurance for the future. You can begin to feel better now and you can reduce the likelihood of suffering and illness later in life. Naturopathic medicine involves you as a participant You will find that I listen very carefully to what you have to say. I want to be sure that I understand why you came to see me. After I have gathered sufficient information through questionnaires, physical examination and by listening, I will make suggestions based on my findings. Then we will discuss your situation and decide together a plan of action. I feel it is very important to set goals together so that you are comfortable both with my recommendations and with your part of the responsibility. We will set dates to reassess your condition and your progress. The cost of naturopathic health care is a concern for most people, but the truth is you cannot put a price on health. When you invest in your health, you broaden your horizons and open up opportunities for success in life. No expenditure is a better investment for a successful future. If you are presently quite healthy, you may not notice any dramatic short-term gains. The goal, however, is to learn how to maintain your health as you grow older, for nobody can deny the incalculable difference between a future spent glowing in vital health and one spent suffering from degenerative disease. The sooner you begin to learn and apply the principles of naturopathic health care, the greater your prospects for a healthier and happier future. Naturopathic health care is for those who want to take control of their lives and their health. It is for those who want to understand which actions and attitudes contribute to better health and which detract from it so that they can make positive choices. Naturopathic medicine is concerned with identifying and treating the underlying causes of disease and ill-health Each person is complex and this process of discovery is necessarily a gradual one. Deep-rooted conditions take time to uncover, but if there is progress  that is, if you are starting to feel better and have a better understanding of yourself, and you are feeling more in control of your life and your health  then you will know that it is worthwhile to continue. Naturopaths do place the highest priority on relieving your pain and discomfort as speedily as possible, but they know that the suppression of symptoms gives only temporary relief. Long-term gains are made only be addressing underlying causes. I will discuss your options with you so that you can make choices consistent with your short-term needs as well as your long-term goals. Naturopathy is aimed at identifying and managing stress Stressors may be structural, chemical, biological, mental or emotional in origin, but no matter what the source, the stressor should be identified, acknowledged and then strategies worked out which will manage that stressor in a way which is acceptable to you and compatible with your lifes goals. As your ability to manage stress effectively increases, your immune system will begin to function better. Your resistance to all types of ill-health and disease will improve and the complaints you presently have will being to get better. Naturopathic doctors treat acute conditions The naturopathic doctor is trained in emergency medicine, but will always refer people to the appropriate emergency medical care when the situation warrants it. There are, however, many unpleasant acute conditions for which we can offer help to you and your family. The naturopath is a primary care physician. Many distressing conditions affecting children and adults can be quickly improved to help you avoid pain, loss of sleep, loss of work and anxiety. Naturopathic remedies are healthful  they work in harmony with your body and have few side-effects or after-effects. Dont be embarassed to call, at any time, for advice. If you or a family member feels ill, there is always an underlying cause. Often the cause is easily identified and corrected. I want you to know as mucha you can about these reasons or underlying causes. This knowledge will lead to better health by helping you prevent problems before they occur, or manage then sensibly through naturopathic are, when they do. Naturopathic health car is for children Naturopathic health care is for children as well as young people and adults. The sooner you act to safeguard and maintain the natural pristine health of a newborn baby, the fewer the problems later on. You can do no greater service for your children than to support their health and give them an informed healthy start to life. Our contemporary environment  our culture and belief systems, as well as our physical environment  generates stressors of many kinds which affect your children. The impressions created by commercial interests and the media as to what constitutes a good diet for your child can often lead to erroneous beliefs. A deeper knowledge of nutrition can make a significant difference to your childs present and future health. I would like to discuss with you my understanding of how a variety of factors which affect your childs h ealth can be better managed. Naturopathic health care is different Some of the concepts which you will encounter in my office will be new to you, but I will always take the time to explain to you the reasons behind the things we will be doing together and may also recommend some reading material. Perhaps the most different, and for many the most challenging aspect of naturopathy, is that my clients are encouraged to participate in their recovery and health promotion. Many conditions can be treated with minimal participation on your part, but the results in terms of your ongoing freedom form illness and distress are achieved when you are actively involved.

Allergies and Eczema Explained Naturally
",http://naturalterrain.com/allergies-and-eczema-explained-naturally/,"In my practice, I specialize in pediatrics and I see children with many common conditions, such as eczema, asthma and allergies, as well as more challenging neurological conditions, such as autism and ADHD. I wanted to share a common occurrence I see in practice and that is the treatment of eczema. A few months ago, a concerned mom brought her 1 year old son in as he had been diagnosed with full body eczema. A medical doctor had prescribed cortisone cream and said he will grow out of it. The condition had started at birth and since he was so uncomfortable his mother found that he was extremely fussy and cranky. He was also very itchy and would scratch himself raw given the opportunity. After feeling discouraged with the medical care they received, the parents thought they would explore other avenues of treatment, such as naturopathic medicine. During the patient intake session, I discovered that he was a c-section birth. He had also been quite colicky as a baby and sometimes could not keep food down. Whenever a child presents with the symptom of colic, a few things come to mind: 1) food intolerances 2) a bacterial or gut flora imbalance and 3) spinal disturbances. The other symptoms that occur with food intolerances and an imbalance in gut flora are: eczema, asthma, digestive upset, mood disorders, constipation, difficulty sleeping, and bed wetting. Similar symptoms can also appear in patients who are toxic or in those whose organs of detoxification are not working as well as they should. In this case the boys trunk looked like red welted hives and I asked if any blood work had been done to rule out a true allergy. It turned out this was never offered, so she decided to do an IgE allergy blood test through our office, as well as stool testing to determine the balance of good and bad bacteria in the digestive tract. When looking at immune reactions to allergies, there are 5 types that the body can have: IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE. Most people are familiar with the IgE antibody response (fast immune mediated) which is when you eat a peanut and your throat immediately closes, or you get hives or an anaphylactic reaction. But there is also an IgG antibody response which is considered a slow immune reaction, such as a food intolerance. Most commonly, I test children for food intolerances when they are over 1.5 years of age as this is when their immune systems are more developed and they have built up enough antibodies to give a good response. If I test a child and they are positive, it means they have what is known as leaky gut syndrome and I start them on a treatment plan. This includes a dietary plan that eliminates the foods they are reacting to based on their individual test results  most commonly wheat and dairy as these are the most common foods that cause problems. Another important point in this case is that he was a c-section baby. It is important to note that when a baby is born, it gets its first dose of bacteria when it travels down the vaginal canal. These good bacteria or probiotics colonize the infants digestive tract (assuming the mother has a healthy vaginal canal) and serve as part of our lifelong immune system. C-section children do not get this opportunity and therefore usually have a lot more health problems versus their vaginal birth counterparts. 1 In this case, I prescribed the following dietary changes while waiting for the test results: eliminate dairy and wheat from the moms diet (as she was still breast feeding) and the solid portion of the childs diet. As detoxification is also an important part of the process, I also prescribed very gentle liver support that involves a three step process: Step 1: homeopathic remedies to start the drainage or removal of toxins Step 2: glutathione to help the liver get rid of these toxins and Step 3: a herbal combination to promote better liver function. Most parents say to me My child is only x months old, how can their liver be toxic?. What people dont realize is that in todays society children are being born toxic. They acquire toxins in utero and/or while being breast-fed.2 We have five detoxification organs  our liver, kidneys, colon, lungs and skin. If the liver cannot keep up with the removal of toxins, the detoxification process spills onto the other organs and when the entire system is overburdened, symptoms appear such as eczema, asthma or bowel issues. When I saw the patient a week later to go over the test results, she was impressed how fast his skin had cleared up, he was not as fussy or cranky and seemed to be a more pleasant child. His blood work confirmed the following IgE allergies: peanut, milk, wheat, egg white and soybeans. Based on the stool test results, he also had candida which is a chronic fungal problem. Over time with the correct nutritional support to heal leaky gut syndrome he may be able to eat some of these foods periodically and not get such a severe skin reaction. For more information on Leaky Gut Syndrome  see Dr. Christina Bjorndals article: I have a leaky what? Leaky Gut syndrome explained. After one month of treatment, he was doing really well and we started the second phase of treatment to deal with the overgrowth of candida. This meant that further dietary changes were necessary, primarily eliminating all forms of sugar from his diet, including fruits. This is an example of a case that cleared up quickly, and illustrates the primary philosophy of Naturopathic Medicine which is to address and treat the root cause of disease and to not give things to simply cover up symptoms or palliate. By taking the time to remove the foods that were causing an immune reaction, rebalance the bacterial imbalance in the digestive tract and support the body in detoxification the patient is actually cured of eczema. It is important to remember that symptoms like colic, eczema, and constipation are signals from the body that it is out of balance or over-burdened. When you listen to your body and support it, the healing process has a chance to take place naturally. 1.

EWGs own research has found that children are born pre-polluted with nearly 300 industrial chemicals, pesticides and contaminants that have been found to cause cancer in lab studies or in people. Four of every 10 Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes, and two of every 10 will die from it. Beyond talking to your doctor about lifestyle changes that are known to make a difference  stopping smoking, reducing drinking, losing weight, exercising and eating right  there are things you can do to reduce your risk. Here are some simple ways you can reduce your exposure to potentially cancer-causing chemicals (click here to download the PDF): 1. Filter your tap water. Common carcinogens in tap water include arsenic, chromium, and chemical byproducts that form when water is disinfected. A simple carbon tap-mounted filter or pitcher can help reduce the levels of some of these contaminants. If your water is polluted with arsenic or chromium, a reverse osmosis filter will help. Learn about your tap water and home water filters at EWGs National Tap Water Database. 2. Seal outdoor wooden decks and play sets. Those built before 2005 are likely coated with an arsenic pesticide that can stick to hands and clothing. Learn more from EWG. 3. Cut down on stain- and grease-proofing chemicals. Fluorochemicals related to Teflon and Scotchgard are used in stain repellants on carpets and couches and in greaseproof coatings for packaged and fast foods. To avoid them, avoid greasy packaged foods and say no to optional stain treatments in the home. Download EWGs Guide to PFCs.  4. Stay safe in the sun. More than one million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year. To protect your skin from the suns cancer-causing ultraviolet (UV) radiation, seek shade, wear protective clothing and use a safe and effective sunscreen from EWGs sunscreen database. 5. Cut down on fatty meat and high-fat dairy products. Long-lasting cancer-causing pollutants like dioxins and PCBs accumulate in the food chain and concentrate in animal fat. 6. Eat EWGs Clean 15. Many pesticides have been linked to cancer. Eating from EWGs Clean 15 list of the least contaminated fruits and vegetables will help cut your pesticide exposures. (And for EWGs Dirty Dozen, buy organic.) Learn more at EWGs Shoppers Guide to Pesticides. 7. Cut your exposures to BPA. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic estrogen found in some hard plastic water bottles, canned infant formula, and canned foods. Some of these chemicals cause cancer in lab studies. To avoid them, eat fewer canned foods, breast feed your baby or use powdered formula, and choose water bottles free of BPA. Get EWGs tips to avoid it. 8. Avoid carcinogens in cosmetics. Use EWGs Skin Deep cosmetic database to find products free of chemicals known or suspected to cause cancer. When youre shopping, dont buy products that list ingredients with PEG or -eth in their name. 9. Read the warnings. Some products list warnings of cancer risks  read the label before you buy. Californians will see a Proposition 65 warning label on products that contain chemicals the state has identified as cancer-causing. HALE TO KALE SALAD This salad is loaded with crunch. The combination of kale, carrots, cabbage and seeds makes a salad that is audibly delicious. Kale is extremely good for you, but make sure you chop it finely. Ingredients: 1 bunch Kale, chopped 1 bunch 3 cups Carrots, grated 750 ml 1/2 head Red cabbage, thinly sliced 1/2 head 1/2 cup Tamari pumpkin seeds (see method below) 125 ml 1/2 cup Tamari sunflower seeds (see method below) 125 ml 1/2 cup Flax or hemp oil 125 ml 1/3 cup Bragg Liquid Aminos 80 ml 5 tbsp Balsamic vinegar 75 ml 1 tsp Oregano, dried 5 ml Method Wash kale and chop. Be careful to rinse the leaves to remove dirt and grit. In a cast iron skillet over medium to high heat, stir sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Remove from heat when theyre toasted golden brown. While the skillet is hot, add in a few drops of tamari, which will sear onto the seeds. Remove and let cool. In a large bowl combine chopped kale, carrots, cabbage and seeds. Set aside.

10 Nutrients depleted by the Birth Control Pill
",http://naturalterrain.com/10-nutrients-depleted-birth-control-pill/,"As Naturopathic Doctors, an area that we excel in is balancing our patients hormones (male or female). A common misconception that women have about their menstrual cycle is that the birth control pill (BCP) is prescribed to regulate their cycle. This couldnt be further from the truth. It is important that medical professionals start referring to the birth control pill for what it is: a suppressive hormonal therapy that overrides the natural production of hormones. Also, women need to be aware that there are side effects to taking the BCP that can be life-threatening. These side effects include blood clots (which can lead to death1), breast cancer risk and depression. Less serious side effects include: headaches, dizziness, nausea, breast tenderness, break through bleeding and decreased libido. Also, the pill can deplete your nutritional status which ultimately exacerbates these side effects. The table2 below shows what nutrients are depleted by the BCP, the symptoms that occur due to nutrient deficiencies and food sources of the nutrient. With some nutrients, such as the B vitamins, Magnesium and vitamin C, supplementation will be necessary to get the number of milligrams required to restore function while you are taking the BCP. If you are using a copper IUD, it is especially important to supplement with zinc in order to offset the copper being absorbed. It is best to see an ND who can help you determine the appropriate doses for your individual needs.     Nutrients Depleted by BCP Symptoms and Problems Function in body Food sources   Vitamin B6 Depression, sleep and skin problems, increased cardiovascular disease risk, confusion, anxiety, fatigue Enzyme, protein metabolism, Red blood cell production, reduces, homocysteine, nerve & muscle cells, DNA/RNA, B12 absorption, immune function Poultry, tuna, salmon, shrimp, beef liver, lentils, soybeans, seeds, nuts, avocados, bananas, carrots, brown rice, bran, wheat germ, whole grain flour   Folic Acid Anemia, immune function, fatigue, insomnia, hair, high homocysteine, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, cervical dysplasia Mental health, infant DNA/RNA, adolescence & pregnancy, with B12 to regulate RBC production, iron function, reduce homocysteine Supplementation, fortified grains, tomato juice, green vegetables, black-eyed peas, lentils, beans   Vitamin B1 Depression, irritability, edema, heart, age-related cognitive decline, Alzheimers, fatigue Carbohydrate conversion, breaks down fats & protein, digestion, nervous system, skin, hair, eyes, mouth, liver, immune system Pork, organ meats, whole grain and enriched cereals, brown rice, wheat germ, bran, Brewers yeast, blackstrap molasses   Vitamin B2 Anemia, decreased free radical protection, cataracts, poor thyroid function, fatigue, muscle weakness, elevated homocysteine, nerves Metabolism, carbohydrate conversion, breaks down fats & protein, digestion, nervous system, skin, hair, eyes, mouth, liver Brewers yeast, almonds, organ meats, whole grains, wheat germ, mushrooms, soy, dairy, eggs, green vegetables   Vitamin B3 Cracking, scaling skin, swollen tongue, digestive problems, diarrhea, confusion, anxiety, fatigue, Energy, digestion, nervous system, skin, hair, eyes, liver, eliminates toxins, sex/stress hormones, improves circulation Beets, Brewers yeast, meat poultry, organ meats, fish, seeds, nuts   Vitamin B12 Anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, loss of appetite/weight, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, depression, dementia, poor memory, oral soreness, increased cardiovascular risk Healthy nerve cells, DNA/RNA, red blood cell production, iron function Fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, milk products   Vitamin C Muscular and nervous irritability, muscle spasms, muscle cramps and tetany, tooth decay, periodontal disease, lowered immune system, easy bruising, poor wound healing, depression, possibly hypertension Enzyme activation, second messenger roles (transmitting hormonal information), blood clotting, cell and cell organelle membrane function, nerve impulse transmission and muscular contraction, tone and irritability Supplementation, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cantaloupe, cauliflower, citrus, guava, kiwi, papaya, parsley, peas, potatoes, peppers, rose hips, strawberries and tomatoes   Magnesium Appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue cramps, numbness, tingling, seizures, asthma, osteoporosis, heart spasms, heart rhythm, cardiovascular problems, personality changes, PMS involved in 300 biochemical body reactions, muscle/nerve function, heart rhythm, immune system, strong bones, regulates calcium, copper, zinc, potassium, vitamin D Green vegetables, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, whole unprocessed grains   Selenium Destruction to heart/pancreas, sore muscles, fragility of red blood cells, reduced antioxidant protection, immune system Antioxidant, works with vitamin E (thins blood), immune function, prostaglandin production Brewers yeast, wheat germ, liver, butter, cold water fish, shellfish, garlic, whole grains, sunflower seeds, Brazil nuts   Zinc Growth retardation, hair loss, diarrhea, impotence, eye & skin lesions, loss of appetite, taste, weight loss, would healing, weak immunity, mental lethargy Supports enzymes, immune system, wound healing, taste/smell, DNA synthesis, normal growth & development during pregnancy, childhood and adolescence Oysters, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts, seafood, whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, dairy    As you can see, there are many nutrients that become imbalanced when taking the BCP. What amazes me about this medication is that women often take it for several years, even decades, without questioning the long term effects it could be having on their health. A case in point is that I had a patient who was 49 years old, and had been taking the BCP for 20 years. She was experiencing hair loss and I suggested going off the pill. The interesting thing is after stopping the medication she never got another period! And now, 6 years later, she remains in menopause with no negative symptoms and her hair loss has stopped. I wonder how many years she took the medication unnecessarily and if she had stopped it sooner what might have happened. I know that the BCP can and does work for many women, however, if you are using it to put a band-aid over annoying menstrual symptoms, to clear up acne, to address a heavy menstrual flow or because you dont know what else to do, you should know that there is another more effective option to balancing your hormones. Our approach gets to the underlying causes of all of those symptoms, balancing your hormones and avoiding the dangerous side effects of medication. If you are on the birth control pill, but you arent sexually active, maybe now is a perfect time to take a break from unnecessary medications and allow the natural rhythm of your body to be restored. Always remember, that once you are armed with the right information about how your body works, you can make healthy choices that work for you! I know you can do this  the science of your hormones is on your side! If you are ready to support your hormonal health, please call 587-521-3595 to schedule an appointment.   http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yaz-yasmin-birth-control-pills-suspected-in-23-deaths-1.1302473 SpectraCell Laboratories, Inc.

14 Simple Tips to Kick Sugar Cravings
",http://naturalterrain.com/11-simple-tips-kick-sugar-cravings/,"14 Simple Tips to Kick Sugar Cravings by Dr. Chris Sugar is the one substance that I have a bumpy, rocky, rickety relationship with. I dont think I am alone in that. It is the one substance that I am able to eliminate for months at a time and then something happens  either a birthday, a chocolate occasion (Valentines Day, Easter, Halloween, Christmas) and I have one piece  and then the next thing you know I am craving it again and having a hard time resisting the temptation and back on the sugar roller coaster with blood sugar crashes, headaches, mood swings, acne and weight gain  fun stuff!! It is almost drug-like for me  it is my go to in times of stress and I have to admit, I find it comforting. I am embarking on another sugar-free phase and will be incorporating the suggestions below. I hope youll join me!!  Watch one or all of the documentaries available on sugar: Fed Up, Hungry for Change, Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead or The Secrets of Sugar. This will increase your awareness about sugar and will provide additional incentive to decrease your dietary consumption of sugar. Remember your math. On food labels, sugar is quoted in grams. But what does this really mean? I find it helpful to remember that 4 grams of sugar is equal to 1 teaspoon. This gives me a better visual when I am reading labels. For example, if the yogurt you are eating is artificially sweetened, it may contain 24 grams of sugar in  cup serving. This is the equivalent of 6 tsp of sugar, which is a lot! In this case, it is better to buy plain yogurt and mix in  a cup of fresh fruit. Eat within your limits. As you are decreasing the amount of sugar in your diet, it is best to figure out what your average daily consumption is by keeping a diet diary. From there, you can make changes. Aim to have 1-2 less teaspoons of sugar per week until it is eliminated from your diet. Avoid Processed Junk Foods:Sugar is an addictive substance that has a powerful influence on your brain. Eating sugar artificially stimulates a region of your brain called the nucleus accumbens, to produce dopamine, the pleasure neurotransmitter. Soon dopamine levels drop and we start to feel flator a bit down. We crave this pleasant, feel-good feeling againso we reach for sugar and the cycle of addiction has begun. The best thing you can do is avoid processed junk food which contains sugar to help break this cycle. Boost Your Serotonin:Serotonin, also known as the happiness hormone, can be raised through a natural low glycemic diet, daily exercise and plenty of deep restful sleep. When you have sufficient serotonin, you are less likely to have cravings for sweets. Use Stevia to Satisfy Your Sweet Tooth:The all-natural sweetener, stevia, has zero calories, does not raise blood sugar levels despite being 300 times sweeter than sugar. If you have sugar cravings and want to satisfy your sweet tooth, stevia is a safe bet. Stevia comes in a liquid and powder form and is available in most grocery and health food stores. Stay hydrated with Water: You may sometimes think that your body is asking for sugar, when in fact its dehydrated and really craving water! Remember the rule of thumb with water is to drink  your body weight (in pounds) in ounces. If you weigh 125 lbs, the minimum amount of water to drink is 2L. Many complain about the taste of water, so try this simple delicious cravings-buster lemonade: In 8 oz. of water, add the juice of  lemon and 5 drops of stevia. You could also try a warm cup of green tea, sweetened with stevia after your meal. This satisfies your sweet tooth and you wont want a dessert. Stabilize Blood Sugar levels:Eat several small, healthy meals throughout your day instead of three large portions to avoid dips in blood sugar. Your evening meal should include one of the preferred gluten-free grain-like seeds, such as quinoa, millet, buckwheat or amaranth. If you do this, your body will produce more serotonin, youll feel happier and youll sleep much better at night. Have Plenty of Greens:Loaded with nutrition greens help boost your energy and help reduce cravings for sugar and processed foods. Here are some simple green juice recipes it try:a) Celery*, lemon and pear (or apple*);b) Celery*, cucumber*, lemon (leave the skin on) and pear (or apple*); c)Celery*, cucumber*, kale, lemon and pear (or apple*); d)Celery*, cucumber*, lemon, parsley and pear (or apple*)*ensure organic Eat More Sea Vegetables:Loaded with vitamins and minerals, seaweed or sea vegetables make for a great addition to salads and meals! They are mineral-rich while eating anything with sugar immediately depletes minerals from your body. Sprinkle dulse flakes on your salad or an avocado. Add seaweed to your soups for a rich salty and mineral flavour. Eat and Drink More Fermented Foods and Drinks:Fermented foods and drinks are an important way to reduce or even eliminate cravings for sugar. Try live fermented kefir, sauerkraut, kim-chi, kombucha tea, natural plain yoghurt, coconut kefir or any of your favourite fermented foods. Youll be amazed at how the sour taste of fermented foods and drinks relieves the desire for sugar and processed foods. Use fresh fruit as a healthy sugar substitute:Summer is such a great time to incorporate healthy fruit into your diet. Remind yourself of what sugary, processed foods really are: dead energy food with no vitality. Compare that to a strawberry that is bursting with flavour or having juicy watermelon  there is no comparison! Enjoy the vitality of fresh fruit first and you will kick your craving for unhealthy sugary foods Learn Meditation & Stress Reduction Techniques:Meditation can help ward off cravings by helping to reduce stress. Stress creates the hormone cortisol, which increases blood sugar levels. This is a vicious cycle that damages your adrenals and creates sugar cravings. Try a exercise, yoga or meditation class before or after work to calm your body and mind. Try EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique):If youre looking to shift the desire for sugar, lose weight, stop a habit of binging or eliminate any addiction, you owe it to yourself to learn about EFT. EFT is an easy tool that anyone can learn in minutes. You simply tap on emotional acupressure points on your body while repeating key statements that help shift your body, mind and habits.

EPA and DHA for ADHD
",http://naturalterrain.com/epa-dha-adhd/,"What is ADHD? ADHD stands for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder. It is the most common neurological condition in children and it is becoming more prevalent1. ADHD is a cluster of symptoms that fall into three main categories: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. It is usually diagnosed in childhood and can continue through adolescence and adulthood. Some children affected may be hyperactive, have more trouble being patient or be more impulsive with their behaviour than other children their age. What this means is that a child with ADHD can have more difficulty doing well in school or integrating in their community2. Approximately 3-7% of children in Canada are affected by ADHD, though the percentage is increasing. In a classroom of 25-30 children, at least one is likely affected3. There is no clear causation pathway to the development of ADHD. The causal factors are likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors as ADHD tends to run in families and also follows environmental distribution patterns. When a disorder is said to be genetically determined, it is often thought there is nothing one can do to address it because genetic information is fixed at birth. However, there is much we can do with our lifestyles that does in fact make a large impact on the expression of the genetic material we inherit. In other words, things we do during our lives (ie diet, substance use, exercise, exposure to chemicals, etc) can modify the way our DNA behaves. Due to this reason, as well as the fact that ADHD is also affected by environmental factors, there is great opportunity for the treatment of this disorder 1,4. What are Omega 3 fatty acids/oils? Omega 3 oils are a specific kind of fat that is present in our cell membranes. They are essential because we are not able to make them ourselves, we must obtain them from our diet. Foods high in Omega-3 include fish, vegetable oils, nuts (especially walnuts), flax seeds, flaxseed oil, and leafy vegetables. Not only is Omega 3 an important part of our cell membranes, they also play a role in the cell signaling between cells, they are the building blocks for blood clotting factors and they affect the contraction and relaxation of blood vessel walls. These are the direct effects of Omega 3 fats, but they also have indirect effects through their binding to receptors that regulate gene function, thereby modifying gene expression of our DNA. These are the cellular-level effects of Omega 3 fats. But what does supplementing with the oils do for our overall health? Omega 3 fats have been shown to:  prevent heart disease and stroke5 treat depression and other mood disorders6 prevent and mediate the progress of type 2 diabetes7, 8 improve memory and cognitive function9  reduce inflammation10  Omega 3 fats make a difference in our health. It is helpful to have a good dietary intake, but the benefits and preventive effect of Omega 3 fat is maximized when supplemented above our dietary intake, with dosage according to the presenting concern. There are a few types of Omega 3 fatty acids, with the two most well-known and celebrated being eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA). EPA and DHA are mostly found in fish and are often commercially called fish oils. Omega 3 supplementation and ADHD Two facts point to the impact that Omega 3 supplementation may have on ADHD:  Omega 3 supplementation is effective in other neurological disorders such as cognitive decline, poor memory and depression6,9 Children with ADHD have altered fatty acid profiles when compared to unaffected children, suggesting a correlation between poor fatty acid profiles and development of the condition. In other words, children with ADHD have a lower proportion of EPA and DHA in their cell membranes than other children. As such, investigators have begun to look at the use of EPA and DHA on children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder1  In a recent study with high-dose DHA and EPA supplements given to children with ADHD for 8 weeks, there was significant improvement in the biological and psychosocial markers of the condition. The study measured both the fatty acid content of their cell membranes (as a biological marker) and child behaviour (as a psychosocial marker). The starting dose was 30 g/d of combined EPA and DHA and this was adjusted mid-way through the intervention (week 4) based on the changes occurring in the fatty acid profiles. Fatty acid profiles: the average EPA and DHA levels in the cell membranes of the supplemented children significantly increased by a factor of 9.5 and 2.4 respectively, meaning that their fatty acid profiles responded to the supplementation. With just 8 weeks of intervention their profiles were significantly changed. This allows us to see, biologically, that the supplementation is having an effect at the cellular level and reaching its goal of improving fatty acid profiles. Behaviour: All categories of the behavioural scale used (ADHD SC-4) were improved by week 8, specifically inattention, hyperactivity, oppositional/defiant behaviour, cognitive problems/inattention and conduct disorder. This allows us to appreciate the psychosocial impact of supplementation. What does this mean? It means that supplementation with Omega 3 oils at the correct dose has significant impact on the altered biology and behaviors exhibited in ADHD. It also gives us an understanding of how to track the biological impact of the supplementation, allowing us to study correlations between fatty acid profiles and ADHD presentation1. In short, we can observe the clinical benefit of supplementation at not just a cellular level, but at a life level too. What can you do? Addressing ADHD in children requires a multi-factorial approach. There is much we can do with lifestyle to modify our genes and therefore modify expression of some conditions. It is an important discovery that supplementing children who have ADHD with high-dose EPA and DHA is a safe and effective way to treat their condition. How do you take action with this new knowledge to help your children? Talk to your health care provider. Omega 3 supplementation is generally safe, but using it at high doses for medical intervention means it must be monitored. Note that excessive unregulated supplementation affects blood clotting and could dangerously increase bleeding time. Using Omega 3 supplements is an effective way to address ADHD, but proper supplementation dosages and protocol is determined by working with your health care professional/Naturopathic doctor.

The Beauty of Defeat
",http://naturalterrain.com/the-beauty-of-defeat/,"Yesterday was the 21st anniversary of my suicide attempt. Ive written about this before, but this year I have been writing my book and in this process I have been reviewing my journals. It is no coincidence that last week, I was reading my journal from 1994 (age 27) when my struggle into darkness seemed impossible to emerge from. I think I have had the experiences I have had, the struggle of coming to the place of understanding & acceptance and the pain of feeling ostracized my entire life in order to learn to accept myself. For me  being adopted into a family some of whom werent as open to the idea of adoption (on my dads side) when they said to my parents  Well, blood is thicker than water.this contributed to my feeling like I never fit anywhere  especially being adopted into a Norwegian family full of blonde haired, blue-eyed beauties. All of this was necessary for me to learn forgiveness ultimately of myself and others. In school, I was always highly sensitive, shy and teased. Then my plunge into the depths of depression, anxiety and bulimia were all hard pills to swallow. These mental health labels were something I hid. It has been a secret that is deep, dark and covered in lots of stigma, shame, discomfort, taboo, lack of acceptance and denial. They are my shadow sides1  the disowned parts of myself that I didnt like, love or accept. For the past 30 years, I have been working on accepting these aspects of myself and learning to love those parts of myself that I dont want to look at  that I shun, disbelieve and deny  essentially, I have been acknowledging my shadows. With the writing of my book, where I unveil all my truth  and risk all my greatest fears  fears of ostracism, misunderstanding, judgment and stigmatization  I reclaim these denied aspects of my soul that need as much love as the rest of me. I have been scouring my journals from 1984-2014  and I found it fitting that last week I stumbled across the last entries I made in my journal before attempting suicide  here is what I wrote: February 24, 1994: I am home today (at Moms)  took a day of bereavement leave for my Grandmas (on my Dads side) funeral and I will go to the memorial service tomorrow. Last night and today I almost feel depressed!! I think it is because I am worn out, tired, sick with a cold (still), lonely, confused about the future etc. As far as work goes, I havent had a chance to enjoy anything because Ive been stressed with mutual funds. My colleague is picking the shit out of me, going through my papers and things, but soon it will be better when I have the time to do what I want. I must try hard to maintain the correct balance  dont overwork yourself, try to get to work by 7-7:30am and leave by 5:30-6pm in order to do your workout and things for yourself like write, sew, decorate, visit friends, etc. I think Im feeling really single at the moment, but you know that it doesnt matter  you have to be comfortable with yourself & love yourself & then youll meet the right person. Its not that I am miss picky  it is just that I know the importance of finding a soul mate. Dont worry about things Chris, youll be fine, look forward & up with a smile on your face & in your heart! Next entry: March 20, 1994 Well, work is still stressful, but getting somewhat better. It is frightening what I dont know, but its just as frightening to see the way the Branch operates. Oh well, things will get better  just remember that you cant do it all in one day! Be patient, work hard, but also relax and enjoy yourself. Sweet dreams Christabelle! Remember who loves you the most and always will xoxo Next entry March 31, 1994 Im really not digging my job  I cant stand the disorganization, how long it takes to do one thing, lack of support. The person I replaced was a jerk. Things just seem to get dumped on you  I cant seem to get ahead. My time doesnt feel like my own. Solutions? Suicide! Quit your job! No, come on Chrissy, you can do it  have an attitude adjustment & be positive. It will just take time before everything comes together. Make out your to-do lists and try to stick to them. Next entry: June 5, 1994 Well, its been two months since Ive written and things havent been going that great. Im still very unhappy with life, my job, etc and I cant seem to figure out what is the problem. I am definitely depressed. Ive been to Dr. Remick who put me on an anti-depressant (Zoloft) which has helped a bit, but not a lot! I have to try and figure out why/what it is thats making me feel this way. Is it work? Do you like what you do? Can you even answer that question? Im not thrilled with the Branch Manager or the other Commercial Lender. I dont really trust them, especially when they go behind my back and authorize commercial deals that Ive just declined without even explaining it to me so I can learn. Is it your love life? What love life! Well, not really because Im not ready for anyone serious right now. Im not interested in physical contact  the companionship would be welcomed, but its not really that. What about the fact that youve been wanting to take your life! You have to make a decision either way  you make your life better by changing what is bothering you  or you give up. To give up is a cop out, I suppose, but it seems like a pretty good option at times. Over the past 8 weeks youve been trying to think of other career opportunities  cop, teacher, your own business or Outward Bound, but nothing has really happened  you havent come to any conclusions except you want to quit your job. But why?! Do you hate banking? What would be more along your lines  health, nutrition, helping others? I wish I never decided to do a Commerce degree and go into business/banking. Well, no decisions have come now with this writing. I may or may not talk to you later depending on how things unfold. Dont compare yourself to others; just do the best you can do. Maybe you should go in and talk to the Branch Manager  tell him how much you hate your position right now. Maybe I am in over my head  Ask him what he thinks I should do? And that was it. I never talked to anyone about how I was feeling. That the thoughts of self-doubt had been plaguing me for 6 months  thoughts that constantly told me: I wasnt good enough, I was stupid, I was a loser, I was not worth the breath I was breathing, etc. Four days later, I tried to kill myself. I consider June 9, 1994 like my birthday. It is the day I woke up and started the process of acceptance of myself which has been unraveling for the last 21 years. Given the amount of poison I consumed, I really should not be here. I realize that no one leaves the planet until God decides it is time, and youve passed the tests that youve come here to learn. Im still learning to love myself and others, to be open to all possibilities, to let go of my fears, to go deep into the darkness and from this, I know that all will be what it will be in the end  and it is beautiful. All of it. May you continue to see the beauty in your life  and may you be able to see the beauty or gifts in the pain you endure. My heart will always go out to you. Reference: 1.

Hormone Havoc – from imbalance to bliss
",http://naturalterrain.com/hormone-havoc-from-imbalance-to-bliss/,"One of my first cases in practice was a 51 year old female who was experiencing horrible symptoms from menopause. She wasnt sleeping because of extreme hot flashes and night sweats, and this was affecting her ability to function at work during the day. I typically explain to patients that there are three levels of hormone therapy: 1) Synthetic  which is the most potent 2) Bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) which is still synthetic, but the chemical components in the cream are similar in molecular structure to human hormones which is why it is referred to as bio-identical and 3) Naturopathic treatment using diet, lifestyle suggestions, herbs, acupuncture, homeopathics and nutraceuticals. I also explain that in Western medicine, we have medicalized our menstrual cycle and hormonal symptoms. Instead of understanding that signals from the body  in terms of PMS or menopausal symptoms (i.e. menstrual cramps, heavy periods, irregular flow, abdominal bloating, cravings, increased appetite, weight gain, irritability, anxiety/nervous tension, crying, depression, forgetfulness, mood swings, breast tenderness/lumps, dizziness/faintness, fatigue, headaches, hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and insomnia)  are messages that you are out of balance hormonally, Western medicine deems that you have a medical condition and the solution typically recommended is to take the birth control  a suppressive hormonal therapy that puts women at risk for other health issues including cancer if used for greater than 10 years.1 In terms of menopause, the mistake that many clinicians make is prescribing synthetic or BHRT hormone treatments on a daily basis with no regard to the bi-phasic monthly hormone cycle. For most cases of hormone imbalance, patients are willing to take some form of therapy to restore hormone balance  either botanical tinctures, supplementation, acupuncture, etc. However, in the case mentioned above, the patient did not want to take anything to manage her symptoms and she was not keen on acupuncture, so her prescription was as follows: 1) Eliminate all stress in your life 2) See a counsellor/psychologist for stress management 3) Quit dairy and wheat 4) Quit caffeine 5) Follow up in 2 weeks When I saw the patient at her next appointment, she was feeling 80% better and her symptoms had almost completely resolved. I asked her what she did to eliminate all stress in her life as in the initial appointment we had discussed what was causing her the most anxiety. In her case, the primary stress in her life was her marriage. The patient decided that she no longer wanted to work on the marriage and had verbalized to her husband that she wanted a divorce. She admitted that the dietary changes were difficult for her, but that she had been 100% compliant. The reason I find this case so remarkable is it highlights a few key points: 1. Less is often more 2. The role of stress in health 3. How the foods we eat and what we drink can either be supportive to our health or contribute to the decline of our health 4. There are physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects to health 5. The simplicity of naturopathic medicine When working with patients, often a primary goal is to balance the neuro-endocrine system and I focus on that versus the label or diagnosis the patient has been given. Neuroendocrinology is the study of the interaction between the nervous system and the endocrine system, including the biological features of the cells involved, and how they communicate. Neuroendocrinology arose from the recognition that the hypothalamus controls secretion of pituitary gland hormones which maintain balance in the body by regulating reproduction, metabolism, eating and drinking behaviour, energy utilization, osmolarity, and blood pressure.2 The glands involved include the adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary and thyroid glands, as well as the ovaries, pancreas, and testes. When hormone levels of progesterone, testosterone and estrogen decline at menopause, there are two back up systems in the body for production of these hormones: the adrenal gland and fat cells. If women are out of hormonal balance in the decades prior to menopause, and they have not taken care of their adrenal glands or learned to manage the stress in their lives  then the primary back up system for the production of these hormones from the adrenal glands may be lower at menopause. The key point to understand is that menopause can be a joyful experience as one enters into the next phase of their life. It does not have to be a difficult time for women. For this patient, the underlying stress in her marriage was contributing to compromised function of her adrenal glands and the dietary recommendations served to support the function of this important gland. A key step to healing for her was to verbalize and express how she was truly feeling, acknowledge how stressed she was in her marriage, and take steps to finding a solution that worked for her. As Naturopathic doctors, a primary tenet of our medicine is to address the root cause of disease. It is important not to chase the branches (i.e. symptoms) but to figure out what is going on from a macro perspective in the body, where the imbalances are and restore the body back to function.

Probiotics
",http://naturalterrain.com/probiotics/,"Why are probiotics beneficial? Probiotics, translated for life, refer to bacteria in the intestine considered beneficial to health. Two of the most important healthful bacteria are Lactobacillus acidophilus (specific to the small intestine) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (specific to the large intestine), but there are many other organisms to keep in mind. It is important to note that you have more bacteria in and on you than you have cells in your body and that the bacteria in your digestive tract weigh approximately 3lbs. Probiotics are often referred to as the first line of defense when it comes to your immune system  when you go into battle it is important to have a cross section of many bacteria versus an army made up of two types of soldiers. While there are a number of excellent companies providing high quality probiotic products, it is difficult to sort through all the manufacturers claims of superiority, and some products have been shown to contain no active L. acidophilus. As such, see a Naturopathic Doctor who can recommend a quality product to you. Clinical Applications: The intestinal flora plays a major role in the health of the host (you!). The intestinal flora is intimately involved in the hosts nutritional status and affects immune system function, cholesterol metabolism, carcinogenesis, toxin load and aging. Due to the importance of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum to human health, probiotic supplements can be used to promote overall good health. Acidophilus bacteria perform many essential functions. They produce the enzyme lactase, required for the digestion of lactose (milk sugar) and aid in the digestion of other nutrients as well. Some strains fight undesirable microorganisms that invade their territory, aid in the destruction of dangerous disease causing bacteria by producing natural antibiotics and help reduce the levels of low density lipoproteins, the so-called bad cholesterol. When acidophilus colonies are present in sufficient strength, they inhibit the proliferation of Candida albicans, a fungal organism (yeast) that can cause a host of problems. Bifidobacterium produce lactic and other acids that increase the acidity of the region they inhabit and make the area less hospitable to dangerous bacteria. They prevent harmful bacteria from converting compounds known as nitrates (ingested in food or water) into related compounds called nitrites. Nitrites in turn can be converted into nitrosamines, which are known cancer-causing agents. When present in sufficient numbers, bifidobacterium prevent disease-causing bacteria and fungi from forming colonies in their territory. Bifidobacterium also aid in the production of B vitamins and assist in the dietary management of certain liver conditions. The body can lose its store of friendly bacteria in many ways. For example, if you must take antibiotics, these drugs not only destroy harmful bacteria, but kill off the essential bacteria as well. Birth control pills, certain over the counter drugs, the chlorine and fluorine in tap water, environmental pollutants, mental and physical stress, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, tobacco and alcohol also reduce the normal levels of beneficial bacteria. Even just getting older causes a loss of the friendly bacteria you need to stay healthy. Because friendly bacteria have the astonishing ability to rid the body of disease causing bacteria before then can create a problem, probiotic supplements have become a virtual necessity today.

Environmental Toxins – Do You Know Your Body’s Levels?
",http://naturalterrain.com/environmental-toxins-do-you-know-your-bodys-levels/,"What does your Teflon frying pan, microwave popcorn, pizza box and lipstick have in common? How about a receipt from the store, a can of tuna and a plastic water bottle? Lets not forget that cute rubber duck in the bathtub, anti-bacterial hand soap near the sink, Colgate Total toothpaste and the deodorant in the bathroom cabinet. The answer is chemicals  namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), bisphenol-A (BPA), mercury, triclosan and phthalates. According to the Canadian authors of Slow Death by Rubber Duck: How the Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Life Affects our Health  this is a bad news story with a positive outcome. The bad news is that our bodies are affected on a daily basis by chemicals from environmental pollutants, medications, contaminants in our water supply, pesticides, hormones in our food supply, cooking utensils, pots and pans (Teflon and plastic), cosmetic products, alcohol, childrens toys, canned foods and the list goes on. The cumulative effect of these chemicals can contribute to a wide variety of health concerns, such as: reproductive problems, hormone imbalances, breast cancer, testicular cancer, fatigue, immune dysfunction, asthma, birth defects, liver damage, attention deficit disorder and dementia  to name a few. Some of the chemicals mentioned above have a short life in the body and others are persistent which is a problem not only for you as an individual, but also for the planet. However, it is not a doom and gloom story. As the toxic load in our bodies continues to increase, detoxification is critical to maintain optimal health. The first steps include: 1) understanding your bodys natural detoxification processes 2) learning what factors in our everyday lives disrupt this process and 3) taking the necessary steps to get back on track. This includes a carefully designed nutritional detoxification program that is supported by research and science. Keep in mind that your bodys ability to detoxify may be impaired by factors such as: prescription medications, constipation, poor kidney health, insufficient detoxifying enzymes, poor liver health and/or inadequate nutrients, vitamins and minerals that the liver and other detoxification systems need to perform effectively. At our clinic, we offer an Environmental Pollutants test which measures the level of parabens, phthalates, and volatile solvents in the body. Then based on the results to various pollutants, a treatment program is customized for each patient which supports the organs of detoxification (ie liver, kidneys, colon, lungs and skin). We also recommend the following simple steps to protect your family: 1. Read ingredients on products, as phthalates often are not listed; however, the word Fragrance or Parfum near the end of the ingredient list is your clue that the product contains phthalates. 2. Unplug air fresheners as many contain phthalates. Baking soda is a natural alternative that can be used to absorb bad odors. 3. Visit ecocenter.org to check out ingredients in the toys you own or want to purchase to ensure they are not harmful for your children. 4. Avoid too much fast food  hamburger, pizza or microwavable popcorn packaging may be coated with PFCs (perfluorinated compounds). 5.BPA leaches from containers into the contents and we end up consuming it. Containers do not need to be heated for this to occur. Switch to glass or stainless steel containers where possible. Do not microwave your leftovers in polycarbonate or plastic containers  use glass containers instead. Do not use a plastic lid cover in the microwave to prevent food from spraying. Better yet, dont use a microwave. 6. Change cookware from Teflon (especially if its scratched) to stainless steel or cast-iron and change plastic cooking spoons and spatulas to wood or metal. 7. Buy flaked, skipjack or chunk light tuna instead of solid white (albacore) tuna, which has the highest amounts of mercury. Check out the US Natural Resources Defense Council tuna calculator to see how the fish you are eating affects your mercury levels. King mackerel, shark, swordfish and tilefish also contain high amounts of mercury so avoid these as well. For more information see:  http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/fishshellfish/outreach/advice_index.cfm 8. Avoid products labeled antibacterial that contain triclosan (ie Microban, Biofresh, Lexol 300). Wash your hands the old fashioned way, with a good 30-second lather of soap and water. Colgate Total toothpaste also contains triclosan. 9. Check out www.cosmeticdatabase.com to find out whats in your cosmetic products. If your products rate greater than 5 out of 10 on the toxicity scale, find healthy alternatives by visiting a health food store. 10. When puzzling over the small recycling numbers on the bottom of plastic containers, remember this pneumonic: 4, 5, 1 and 2; all the rest are bad for you. 11. Use cloth bags instead of plastic bags for shopping. 12. Encourage politicians to introduce legislation to phase out PFCs from food wrapper and other consumer products, to legislate for better control of triclosan, and to demand non-toxic toys for your children. 13. Refer to the Environmental Working Groups dirty dozen and clean 15 lists to see which vegetables and fruit contain the most and least amount of pesticides (www.ewg.org) 14. Get your levels of chemicals tested  Naturopathic Clinics can run an Environmental Pollutants Panel  ask your Naturopathic doctor if you need to be tested.

Greening the Cancer Cause: Changing the Way Women Think About Breast Health
",http://naturalterrain.com/greening-the-cancer-cause-changing-the-way-women-think-about-breast-health/,"From April to October, one well-intentioned organization after another is asking for money to support a cure for cancer or cancer research. As a cancer survivor and naturopathic doctor, I donate to a brilliant program created by three courageous women in Canmore, Alberta -the Pink and Green Ribbon campaign.(Now called Rethink Breast Cancer).Committedto stopping cancer before it starts these women put into action local initiatives designed to clean up the environment and bring awareness to the chemicals we put in our bodies with the goal of making our communities healthier places to live. The pink represents a commitment to creating breast cancer-free communities through promoting healthy breast education and focusing on prevention. The green reflects a stand for addressing the connection between the environment and womens health. With the slogan, Love Your Planet. Love Your Body. Love Your Life, the campaign co-founders, including my naturopathic colleague Dr. Monika Herwig, create local initiatives designed to clean up the environment and make our communities healthier places to live. These women, all mothers of daughters, also want to change the way women think about breast health. Theyre not comfortable with the current statistics and predictions for breast cancer (i.e., One in nine will develop breast cancer). In their desire to make a difference, they declare the opposite: Eight in nine women will have healthy breasts for their lifetime.This subtle positive shift is extremely empowering. I find that ones mental health is often an overlooked aspect of ones physical health  and the two are intimately connected to our overall sense of well-being.What would happen to the current statistics for breast cancer if we took a positive approach? Lets do more than wonder!They posed the following questions and started a conversation around the topics below:  What if we all started talking more about breast health? What if healthier breast tissue and less exposure to carcinogens made our breasts less susceptible to cancerous changes? What if all the products available to us as consumers were good for the planet (soil, water and air quality) and for our bodies? What if girls at puberty were taught simple healthy breast practices? What if all women understood the anatomy of their breasts? What if all communities in North America became pesticide-free?  The campaign started onEarth Day and ended on Rachel Carson Day. Rachel Carson was an environmentalist in the 1960s who wrote a book called Silent Spring. She was a pioneer in creating awareness regarding the link between our health and the environment. The Rocky Mountain Soap Company hosts a running event during this time and it is an amazing event that typically sells out  I encourage you to participate in this event. The campaign also provided daily practical solutions for keeping the critical relationship between the environment and health in mind, using the topics soil, air, water, our energy and our bodies. Our soil In medical school, Dr. Sat Dharam Kaur was one of my favourite teachers. Kaur, who has a naturopathic practice in Owen Sound, Ontario, specializing in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer, says, Not unlike our bodies, soil is a living biological entity composed of a community of organisms, organic matter and minerals. A healthy soil provides a high mineral and nutritional reservoir to nurture the vitality of the plants and, in turn, the animals (including humans) that are sustained by it. To establish good health, we need to honour the cycle of life, restore mineral balance to the soil and our food, and eliminate from the environment and our bodies harmful chemicals and heavy metals. Healthy soil action steps  Purchase organically grown food or grow your own food and discourage the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Embrace your playful spirit and dig in the dirt. Connect with the earth and see what you find. Encourage children to join you. Purchase organically grown food or grow your own food and discourage the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  Watch CBCs Wendy Mesley in Chasing the Cancer Answer.I was struck how, in documenting her own breast cancer journey and quest for answers, Mesley also revealed that cancer has become a business-an extremely profitable business for pharmaceutical companies. Our water Rivers and lakes are the earths umbilical cord that brings us water and minerals; the oceans are our collective amniotic fluid. If the rivers and oceans are contaminated, so will the water be that makes up 70 percent of our physical structure, says Dr. Kaur. Healthy water action steps  Filter your water and store in a glass container.My favourite is a reverse osmosis system with builtin activated charcoal, if you can afford it. Otherwise, go with the activated carbon block filter without silver. Store your filtered water in a glass container. Stop using plastic water bottles. Health Canada has acknowledged the health risks associated with bisphenol-A, a toxic compound found in plastic  make the switch to a glass or stainless steel water bottle available at many health food stores. This will reduce the toxic load on your body, as well as decrease plastic refuse for the planet. Drinkwater: The basic rule of thumb is to consume half of your body weight (in pounds) in ounces of water  this is a MINIMUM recommendation. For example, a 140- pound person needs to drink a daily minimum of seven 10-ounce glasses of water each day. Makea commitment to the purity of your drinking water and to the lakes, rivers and water table in your area. Clean up a local river, shoreline or stream by going for a hike and picking up garbage. Prevent dehydration. When we are water deficient, the ability of our kidneys to filter toxins suffers and we have fewer stools. Headaches, fatigue, joint pain, inability to concentrate and digestive disturbances increase.  Our air According to Dr. Kaur, New plant growth continues to release oxygen, while carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants. The balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide ensures the quality of the air we breatheTake steps to restore clean air in our homes, workplaces and communities. Healthy air action steps  Reduce carbon emissions and choose to ride your bike, walk, car pool or take transit. Discover the benefits of deep breathing and how it affects all facets of your life. Being conscious of your breath in difficult moments can completely change your outlook! Get some relief and take off your bra! Feel the air you breathe. There is a 21-fold greater chance of developing breast cancer in women who wear their bras more than 12 hours daily and a 113-fold increase in breast cancer incidence among women who wear their bras all the time. One of the factors that promotes tumour growth is poor microcirculation in the area where tumours develop (often due to impingement of tissue by underwire bras).  Our energy Our sun, from which we derive most of our planetary heat, light and energy, has existed for five billion years, and, like many of us, is considered to be in middle age. Without the sun, there would be no plant or animal life on Earth says Dr. Kaur. Healthy energy action steps  Invest your energy in activities, hobbies, volunteer work or causes you feel dedicated to and excited about that develop your skills and abilities. Learn to define your needs and gifts. Connect with groups of like-minded individuals throughout your life who support and validate you. If possible resolve conflict as it occurs, rather than holding it inside you, or let it go. Find an outlet for expressing your feelings (be they anger, grief or despair)  such as journaling, art, counseling, song writing, etc.And then if that really isnt working, do up your shoelaces and get out for a walk, run or bike and breathe it off. Find a spiritual practice or exercise that you feel connected to. It is my personal belief that a connection to a spirit, whatever your chosen practice is, is critical and vital to healing yourself and the current state of the planet. If possible resolve conflict as it occurs, rather than holding it inside you, or let it go.  Our bodies The dramatic rise in breast cancer rates over the last half-century is not so much due to female hormones but to environmental chemicals that mimic female hormones and our bodys inability to eliminate them, notes Dr. Kaur. Healthy body action steps  Minimize your exposure to xenoestrogens (see below), such as those found in plastic. Eliminate plastic residues from your body by doing a supervised sauna detoxification. Avoid plastic cling wrap. Use paper towels to wrap sandwiches. Reduce consumption of fatty foods packaged in plastic and heat-sealed containers. Before accepting the new plastic coating treatment for your childrens teeth, ask your dentist whether it contains bisphenol-A. Learn to read labels and properly dispose of unhealthy household cleaners. Get comfortable with doing a self breast-exam. Your breasts will be easiest to examine right after your period. If you are not comfortable doing a self breast exam, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider. Ask her/him to teach you how to do a self breast-exam. Get comfortable with the importance of breast massage. Lastly, I encourage you to purchase Dr. Kaurs books, available online at Chapters/Indigo. Also, make an appointment with a naturopathic doctor and to take the necessary steps you need towards loving yourself, the planet and your life.  With one in nine women developing breast cancer, most women think they are going to be a cancer statistic, and the current media is cultivating a culture where we just assume we will get cancer. This needs to change. More specifically, we need to revolutionize how we think about and address our health. Understanding Hormones and Breast Health An article about breast cancer would be incomplete without mentioning the impact of hormones on our health. Hormones are chemical messengers our endocrine system, responsible for regulating many cellular processes. Hormone receptors are located throughout the body. Breast tissue is one area that contains a high amount of receptors for the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. There are three forms of estrogen (estriol, estradiol and estrone). Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are associated with increased breast cancer risk while estriol (E3) may have protective properties. The other important estrogen to know about is xenoestrogen-manmade synthetic chemicals found in our environment and known as estrogen imposters or hormonal disruptors. Sources of xenoestrogens include synthetic estrogens (birth control pill, HRT, fertility drugs, and hormones in meats and dairy products), chemicals leached into food from microwaving in plastic containers or in plastic wrap, certain detergents, plastics, cleaning supplies, herbicides and pesticides. The body cannot tell the difference between a man-made chemical xenoestrogen and the estrogen the body naturally produces. As such, xenoestrogens disrupt our hormonal balance and messaging system. In addition, they attach more firmly to estrogen receptors and persist in our bodies and the environment longer than natural hormones because we do not have efficient ways to eliminate them. As a result, we are chronically exposed to a higher level of estrogen stimulation than necessary. To add insult to injury, the accumulation of xenoestrogens typically occurs in our fatty tissue, such as the breasts. The cellular accumulation of fat-soluble toxins and xenoestrogens in the breast tissue can make the cells there more vulnerable to abnormal changes and cancer. On a positive note, there are ways to help remove toxins from our bodies, including proper naturopathic detoxification methods, sauna protocols and homeopathic drainage protocols. Since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, the essential approach is to address the cause by decreasing the presence of these compounds in our lives and on our planet.
