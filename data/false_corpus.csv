",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/insanity-results-danielle-burned-off-belly-fat-won-1000,"Danielle Marino, age 43, lost 39 lbs. in 6 months with INSANITY, Shakeology, andBeachbody Performance supplements. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?My husband and I got married and became extremely complacent. We drank 35 times a week (heavily), and smoked a lot when we drank. The weight just kept coming but I wasnt doing anything about it other than secretly hating looking at myself in the mirror and dreading shower time. I had never been this big in my life, not even when I was pregnant! Something had to change, our children were watchingWhat inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?We had purchased INSANITY and tried it twice, failing both times. I was too fat and wasnt ready to commit 100%. Drinking and smoking were much more fun than working out and hurting myself! My husband had an epiphany Thanksgiving day when we were in California visiting family and had stayed up all night partying. I went to bed fairly late and when I woke up, he was still going at it with his brother. The family came back over for breakfast and knew exactly what had been going on and the look in their eyes was enough to shake my husband to the core about his life decisions. He started P90X that Monday. Watching him in the living room for about a month, I was ready. Popped in INSANITY for the third attempt and finished the program in its entirety with amazing results. Problem was, we were still drinking and smoking Well get to that later.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Drinking and smoking were fun! It was our release time, our us time. How in the world are we going to incorporate working out, eating healthy, and Beachbody, and still be able to have fun?! And the food seriously, how was I gonna give up In N Out, Del Taco, Taco Bell, and all those other yummy, convenient places?! This was gonna be tough. My Coach, Sommer Tucker, never gave up on us! But for 3 years, werent fully, like 100% committed. Well isnt this embarrassing we lead a double life. Coaches by day, partiers by night, all the while, hiding it from our team and friends, and never receiving 100% benefits of actually being healthy because honestly, how in the world can you be healthy sucking down vodka and smokes?! Then one day Sommer reached out and asked us to be part of a test group It all changed from there.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?Pushing me to limits I never thought I could reach. Getting results you only see on TV or in magazines. When its real, and its happening to you, its totally different than looking at it through Facebook or any other social media avenue. These were my results, no one elses, mine! And they are amazing!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Where do I start?! Over the course of the past 4+ years, as a team, my husband and I have quit smoking, quit drinking, streamlined our friends and hold those closest to us that encourage us to always be a better version of ourselves, and always move forward. At the age of 43 and 45, we are full marathon runners, certified INSANITY and P90X instructors, we have opened a training center where I teach INSANITY LIVE 4 nights a week, and my husband teaches OCR fundamentals and gets people ready to run races and kill em! Our team of Coaches is growing daily, and heres the coolest part of it all; our kids do everything with us. They run 1/2 marathons, spartan races, come to the training center daily, inspire their friends to do the same, and see us as the parents we were meant to be. Leaders, providers, mentors, and an inspiration in their lives. We are the family that stays and plays together! No more watching mom and dad partying on the porch. So proud that part of my life is over!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I have inspired 100s of people to do the same! Get healthy, fit, work on their marriages, communication skills, life skills, just an all around great package. Life is amazing, and Im so incredibly happy I have the chance to see it through clear eyes. It may have taken me 3 tries to get all the way through INSANITY, and a couple of years of in and out embracing it, but Ive never been stronger in my entire life! And getting ready to run another full marathon next weekend in Huntington Beach!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?She never gave up on me, and always encouraged me to push through the demons in my head. As long as I stayed out of my own way, Id be just fine! We were each others biggest fan, and still are. There arent times of weakness anymore, but when there were, wed remind each other that the outcome of sticking to the plan far outweighs the opposite! And, our kids were watching every move we made, even though they never said it. How can we expect our kids to grow up with self love when we cant even do that to ourselves! We changedHow did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Shakeology daily for the past 4+ years is the key to our nutrition. We have since gone fully plant based diet, and the shake gives us what we need to fuel our bodies. We dont use it as a weight loss, but as a supplement to our diets, and our kids drink it daily as well! Energize for the boost before a workout is always gooood! And the recovery is amazing for those weeks where I incorporate the earlier rounds of INSANITY and really push my class!2Tell us about your experience with Beachbody On Demand. If applicable, how has it helped you achieve your goals?I think its awesome! Very convenient to be able to have the all access and take it with you anywhere!

Does Breastfeeding Really Help You Lose Weight + 11 Other Myths Revealed
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/wellness/does-breastfeeding-really-help-you-lose-weight-11-other-myths-revealed,"There are a lot of assumptions made about breastfeeding. Its the best way to deliver nutrients to your baby; its the most natural way to feed your little one; it wreaks havoc on your nipples, and changes the shape of your beautiful breasts forever. Perhaps one of the biggest ones, at least for moms who cant wait to drop the baby weight and get back in shape: It burns massive calories, and is natures way of helping new moms lose weight.Because this last notion can be so crucial to moms who might long to regain some control over their postpartum bodies rather quickly, lets dispel the myth that breastfeeding will automatically help you lose weight. Yes, it burns calories, and may help lower body mass index (see myth #1 below for more details), but you cant skip the basic weight-loss principles (and overall good health) of keeping an eye on total daily calories, moving more, and choosing quality whole foods to fulfill your nutrition needs and those of your baby.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, and then at least partially for the next six months (since you can introduce solid foods at this point). Outside of that, though, the decision of whether or not to breastfeed, how often to do it, and when to stop are highly individualized.Ultimately, each individual mother is uniquely qualified to decide whether breastfeeding, mixed feeding, or formula feeding is best for her individual situation, says Alison Stuebe, M.D., distinguished scholar of infant and young child feeding at the Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute, and associate professor of maternal fetal medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Were not here to tell you what choices you should and shouldnt be making. But we are here to make sure youre accurately informed. From whether or not to use formula to sore nipples to abstaining from caffeine and alcohol, there are a ton of rumors around breastfeeding. Which are true and which are myths? We had experts weigh in on 12 of the most popular ones so you can better decide whats best for you.12 Myths About Breastfeeding: Whats the Truth?Myth: Breastfeeding helps you lose the pregnancy weight.Truth: Unarguably, breastfeeding causes you to burn calories  the American Pregnancy Association recommends consuming an extra 300500 calories a day. A Dutch study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that breastfeeding could help women  with the exception of those who weighed the most before pregnancy  eliminate weight gained during pregnancy (about 26 pounds) after six months.Whats more, a study in the International Journal of Obesity looked at nearly 750,000 women ages 50 to 64 and found that those who had breastfed their babies not only had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who did not breastfeed, but they also decreased their BMIs by one percent for every six months they breastfed.But, just because breastfeeding helps you burn more calories doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight, points out Laura Gruber, international board certified lactation consultant, registered lactation consultant, and owner of Breastfeeding Housecalls in San Antonio.Breastfeeding mothers tend to feel hungrier, which means they may snack more to make up for those extra calories burned. The choice to consume healthy or unhealthy snacks, and the quantity a mother consumes is what may ultimately drive some moms not to lose the pregnancy weight via breastfeeding alone, Gruber says.Youre still eating for two when you breastfeed, meaning that you pass along whatever nutrition you take in to your baby. This doesnot meanthat you should eat as much of whatever foods youd like, especially if those foods arent nutrient-dense. Eat enough calories to fuel your body properly for nursing, and whatever exercise program you may be doing. If youre following a Beachbody program, you might want to bump up to the next (higher) calorie bracket (considering that breastfeeding burns an extra 300500 calories per day).Myth: You cant breastfeed if you have implants.Truth: Its safe for mothers and for babies to breastfeed if mom has implants, Alison Stuebe reassures. But if you have had plastic surgery, its important to let your doc know. Why? Your natural breasts may affect how well you produce milk.If one breast was much smaller than the other, or if you had minimal breast tissue, you might make less milk, so its important to work closely with your babys provider to monitor early weight gain so that you and your baby get off to a good start, Stuebe adds.If you have breast implants and plan to breastfeed, you may need to supplement to ensure your baby gets enough to eat. A review and meta-analysis of three observational studies published in the International Breastfeeding Journal revealed that women with breast implants who breastfed were less likely to feed their infants with breast milk exclusively compared to women without breast implants. Another study published in the Annals of Plastic Surgery also reported that many women with breast implants needed to supplement their breastfeeding.Myth: You must use both breasts each time you feed.Truth: Its a good idea to offer both, Gruber says. Sometimes babies lose vigor and stamina at the breast because they are tired, yet not necessarily full. They can become tired from sucking on a breast that isnt yielding as much as they need, she explains.Her recommendation: Use your first breast until a baby loses vigor or stamina, since this is the most accurate way of knowing if a healthy baby is getting full. Stop and burp him or her, then always offer the second breast in case baby has made room for more [after] burping. If your baby doesnt want the second breast, thats fine. Then, you can start with the second breast at the next feed, since it will likely be fuller, she adds.Myth: Modern formulas are almost the same as breastmilk.Truth: Formula makers may market their product as being almost as good as the real thing. Breastmilk is a living fluid. Formula is not, Stuebe says. To illustrate, scientists have found that human milk contains immune and stem cells, as well as bacterial community.A mothers milk contains bacteria that colonize her babys gut, helping to grow the babys immune system. And while some formulas have added prebiotics and probiotics, they are fundamentally different from breast milk, Stuebe explains.Myth: Poor milk supply is caused by moms inadequate diet or stress.Truth: There are millions of women everywhere who have stressful lives and poor nutrition yet are still able to produce perfect amounts of milk for their babies, Gruber points out. Low milk supply is generally caused by poor breastfeeding management (such as not feeding baby frequently, or a shallow latch), hormonal issues in mom, or oral issues in baby that would cause poor milk transfer, she explains.Myth: You cant drink alcohol while breastfeeding.Truth: Great news mamas  this ones a myth. It takes about two hours for a single serving of alcohol (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, or 1.5 oz. of liquor) to clear a womans bloodstream. When it clears her bloodstream, it also clears her milk, Stuebe explains.More alcohol does takes more time to clear out, so you may need to pump and discard milk if youve had two or three servings. Check this handy chart that Stuebe recommends.Myth: Breastfeeding is supposed to hurt.Truth: Breastfeeding may feel new and different, but it is not supposed to hurt, Gruber says. With the exception of childbirth, pain is the bodys alert system when something is wrong, so nipples that hurt mean that something is off and can be improved. Moms who feel nipple pain, see or feel their nipples injured, or see misshapen nipples when her baby unlatches should seek help, she adds.Myth: Breastfeeding drastically changes the shape and size of your breasts.Truth: For starters, its important to understand that pregnancy is what changes your body, not breastfeeding. Secondly, your breasts will change, but only temporarily. Breastfeeding can drastically change the shape and size of a womans breasts  but only during certain seasons of nursing, such as when moms milk is transitioning from colostrum to mature milk, Gruber says. Breasts normally return back to pre-pregnancy size and shape after a woman has ended her breastfeeding season.A study published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal reviewed the charts of 93 patients seeking consultation for aesthetic breast surgery, and found that breastfeeding does not appear to have an adverse effect upon breast appearance.Myth: Breastfeeding is just about getting the milk to your baby.Truth: Nurturing your baby is about so much more than nursing. Breastfeeding is about fostering a biological connection between a mother her child, and a mother can nurture her baby at breast no matter how much milk she makes, Stuebe says. Suckling a baby triggers release of the hormone oxytocin, which can encourage bonding and mothering behavior. A baby who is at breast can hear moms heartbeat, and can focus his eyes on moms face.Even moms who dont provide 100 percent of their babys nutrition from their breasts are still able to offer them for suckling, warmth, and comfort. Being an infants food source is just one of the many hats that breasts wear when it comes to babies, Gruber adds.Myth: Smaller breasts may not produce enough milk to feed the baby.Truth: Bra size isnt a reliable predictor of milk production, but some breasts do produce better than others, Stuebe says.OK, quick biology lesson from Stuebe: An adult womans breasts are made up of both fatty tissue and milk-making glandular tissue. One woman might have small breasts that are packed with glandular tissue (great for milk production), while another has very large breasts that are mostly fatty tissue (not so great). And the shape matters, too  widely spaced or cone-shaped breasts can be associated with low milk production, Stuebe adds.Its not easy to predict milk-making based on breast size, which is why its important that all moms and babies see a pediatric provider at three to five days after birth to check in on how breastfeeding is going, Stuebe says.Myth: You cant get pregnant while breastfeeding.Truth: We dont know who started this rumor, but breastfeeding is definitely not birth control. You can absolutely get pregnant while nursing, Gruber reassures.Frequent nursing does prevent ovulation. But, if you pump and use bottles, or your baby doesnt want to eat often, youre going a longer time between feedings at the breast than a mom who breastfeeds every couple of hours. This break can cause a mom to ovulate earlier thus sparking moms fertility even if that mom hasnt had her first period yet after childbirth, Gruber explains.If you want to avoid pregnancy, talk to your doc about birth control options. And dont worry; Gruber assures contraception wont reduce your milk supply.But, can contraception impact the quality of your milk? Research draws mixed conclusions; one review revealed a negative effect on breast milk composition in moms taking birth control, while another trial showed greater weight gain in infants whose moms had an etonogestrel implant. An article published in Clinical and Obstetrics and Gynecology found that the choice and timing of contraception  with nonhormonal methods being the preferred choice  may influence breastfeeding and infant growth patterns. The bottom line: Talk openly with your doctor to explore all of the options to find out what works best for you and your baby.Myth: The longer you breastfeed, the healthier your baby will be in adolescence.Truth: This ones a bit more complicated. Theres compelling evidence that, on a population level, longer breastfeeding is linked with better health, Stuebe says.A study analysis published in Maternal & Child Nutrition, of which Stuebe was a part of, found that for every 597 women who optimally breastfeed, one maternal or child death is prevented.However, thats on a population level. For an individual mother and her child, there are many, many things that contribute to her childs health in adolescence, of which breastfeeding is just one, Stuebe adds. If breastfeeding is extraordinarily difficult for that mom and baby, the struggle to make it work may not be worth it.The TakeawayWhilenursing isnt the golden ticket to a pre-baby body, it does burn calories and, paired with a healthy lifestyle and thoughtful nutrition plan, can help you slim down to your pre-pregnancy weight more quickly if youre careful. Just dont be overly restrictive when it comes to calories and the quality of your calories."

21 Day Fix Results: Busy Mom Lost 124 Pounds, Won $2,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/21-day-fix-results-busy-mom-lost-124-pounds-won-2000,"Rachelle Hosick, age 29, lost 124 lbs with 21 Day Fix and Shakeology. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $2,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Before I started the 21 Day Fix, I had a BMI of 45 and was considered morbidly obese. I felt absolutely horrible about myself, both mentally and physically. I couldnt play with my kids, I had to sit back and watch other moms play with their kids and have fun with them. I was embarrassed to be in a bathing suit, so we rarely went to the pool. I remember one little girl asking me if I was pregnant around thanksgiving 2015. I wasnt. Thats when I knew that I needed to lose weight, but I had all the excuses as to why I couldnt. I let those excuses win until Feb 2016. My top 2 excuses included I have 2 kids, I cant go to a gym and I cant afford a gym membership. My body constantly hurt. I was taking so much ibuprofen for different pains I had. My shoulders constantly hurt. Id wake up every morning and my feet would hurt so bad I could barely walk. Id get sharp pains down my legs and I was always tired.3What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?On 2/2/16, I stepped on the scale and saw 296. I weighed almost 300 lbs! I walked straight to the kitchen and dumped an unopened 2 liter of Mountain Dew down the drain. I havent had soda since. I decided that enough was enough, I knew what I had to do to lose weight and get healthy for me and my family. So I started eating healthy and walking 30 minutes a day. I was so bored and found myself slipping back to my old ways. Thats when I found the 21 Day Fix in March 2016. I didnt want my kids to have a big mom that couldnt play with them. I didnt want my husband to have a unhealthful wife; I wanted him to be proud of his wife and to want to show me off (even though he still treated me like a queen at that size and loved me anyways). I wanted to be healthy and to be able to wear cute clothes! I was done with my excuses. My kids deserved better, my husband deserved better, and most importantly I deserved better than what I was doing to my body.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My biggest challenge was my own excuses. Beachbody and the 21 Day Fix answered those excuses and made them excuses no more! 21 Day Fix is amazing. Its just one 30 minute workout a day, and I can do it in my own home! I love the 21 Day Fix because it tells you exactly what/how much you can eat, how much water to drink, and which workout to do everyday!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I love the simplicity of it. I love that someone who has no idea about losing weight can do it. I love that there is an app to help track progress. I love the workouts; they kick my butt. Even though I still have some room to improve, the muscle that I have gained while doing the 21 Day Fix is amazing! I have muscle! Im also starting to see the ab line down the middle and sides of my stomach from all those ab workouts.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I have noticeable muscles! (Yay!) I am so proud of myself for losing so much weight and being healthy! Im proud of myself for working out everyday, no excuses. Im proud of myself for eating healthy. I proud to be getting even more healthy and toned. My energy is up, I dont have pains all over my body anymore (and if I have pains, its because Autumn kicked my booty and my body is trying to recover). I can get around easily and play with my kids. When I started with 21 Day Fix, I did everything modified. When I did a forearm plank, my stomach touched the ground. I can do almost everything unmodified now and my stomach doesnt even come close to touching the ground when I do the forearm plank. Thats another thing I love, you can still see results when doing the modifiers. Even the modifiers are hard, no one should ever feel ashamed for doing the modifier, you will eventually be strong enough to do the workouts unmodified.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?The 21 Day Fix is an everyday thing for me; its my lifestyle now. Make healthy food choices, drink my Shakeology daily, drink my water, and work out. Since doing the 21 Day Fix, I feel so much better. I can climb a flight of stairs without being tired. I can fit in a regular size arm chair and not have to be afraid my weight is going to break it. I genuinely feel good about the way I look. I dont have to be ashamed, I can be proud of what Ive done and so can my husband and kids. I also love the energy Im getting from Shakeology! I feel like it really does help with any junk food cravings and I feel like Im sleeping much better/deeper at night. *Bonus*: Shakeology is so good, I feel like Im indulging in an ice cream shake or something. Who needs those bad-for-you energy drinks when you can have something so good for you for about the same price?2How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Im a part of a great group of women. All the ladies are always posting encouraging things on there that make you want to better yourself and keep going. The group just keeps you accountable for what your doing and it also gives you other people to interact with who are on the same journey as you.Tell us about your experience with Beachbody On Demand. If applicable, how has it helped you achieve your goals?I love that Beachbody On Demand gives you access to so many free programs! Autumn released a remix The Fix recently, and I have loved being able to switch up my workout with new workouts!

Beachbody Results: Amanda Lost 71.6 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-amanda-lost-71-6-pounds-see-her-results,"Amanda Reece, age 35, lost 71.6 lbs. with a variety of Beachbody fitness programs and Shakeology. She shared her results with the Beachbody Challenge contest, and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I am a mom of twobeautiful children, ages eightand two, and gained about 6065 pounds with each one. After I had my son eightyears ago, I was able to lose the baby weight relatively quickly by dieting and running, but then slowly began to gain some back before I got pregnant with my daughter. After having her twoyears ago, I just couldnt drop the weight. Between working full-time, balancing sports activities with my son, having a newborn, and just daily life, I had let myself go. I was making poor food choices, exercise was nowhere in my vocabulary, I had no energy, and just hated the way I looked. Outside of the day that I delivered my children, I weighed the most I had ever weighed in my life. I didnt want to get on the scale in fear of the reality of what it said, and I lived in leggings and dresses because I just didnt want to face the fact of buying the size I needed. I had zero confidence, never wanted to be in pictures, and just felt terrible about myselfWhat inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My kids and my husband. After multiple failed attempts to lose weight, I had given up. In January of 2016, I had come to the reality that this was just how my life was going to be, and I needed to accept that. I cleaned my closet out and actually started buying clothes that fit even though I was not happy. Finally in March, I said Enough is enough get yourself together and make a change! Diabetes runs in my family, and what kind of example was I setting for my children?! I need my health for myself and for my family. We had booked a couples cruise for August, and I was determined to make a change before this trip. At the time, I really knew nothing about Beachbody but I had heard about the 21 Day Fix program, and a friend recommended a Coach. Then, I made the call to my Coach the call that truly has changed my life in so many ways.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The biggest challenge for me was food. I love to eat.I like big portions and all things that are bad for me, and I stress eat. I would constantly overeat, and had just formed really bad habits like cookies in the afternoon and wine before bed. When I started 21 Day Fix in March, all of that changed. I found myself meal prepping, measuring my food, packing healthy snacks, and cutting out the alcohol. My old/bad habits faded away. I was committed to making a change in my life, and the structure around the program and the support of my Challenge Group helped keep me on track. What I loved most was that it became easy for me no counting calories, no counting points, and I was able to eat real food. The combination of Shakeology and eating every 23 hours helped to keep me full throughout the day and helped to prevent overeating.2What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I chose 21 Day Fix because it seemed manageable for me. I did not have a lot of time, and I was not someone who particularly liked to exercise (okay, I was really lazy and made every excuse under the sun to avoid doing it). I knew that if the program was too intense or took up a lot of my time, I would simply not stick with it So the fact that the workouts were only 30 minutes per day and it was recommended for a beginner made the program appealing to me.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I started seeing results immediately, which I needed, and on average lost about 1012 pounds per month. I did 21 Day Fix for fivemonths straight, then one round of 21 Day Fix EXTREME, oneround of Country Heat, 3 Week Yoga Retreat, and threeweeks of 22 Minute Hard Corps before starting CORE DE FORCE on November 7th. Within sixmonths of starting Beachbody, I lost 70 pounds and reached my goal weight! From March 21, 2016 toNovember 6, 2016, I have lost a total of over 70 pounds and 53 inches. I have gone from a size 14 to a 4. I have energy, confidence, and I love how I am inspiring others to begin their own journey to a healthy lifestyle and to reach their goals. I am so very proud of all of those things I feel amazing!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My life has changed in so many ways. I now have energy to keep up with my kidsandlook forward to working out every day.Eating healthy is now the norm (I still meal prep, plan, and use my portion-control containers). I love shopping for new clothes (and feel good wearing them).I now feel good about myself and know that I am so much healthier than Ive ever been in my life! Its my new way of life; for me this is a new lifestyle, a journey, and I dont see a stopping point.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Being in a Challenge Group helped hold me accountable. I knew that I had to post what I ate at the end of every day and that I had to post my results on Monday. It made me think twice about making bad choices, and forced me to stay on track over the weekend since I knew the weigh-in was on Monday. I also loved the fact that everyone was on the same journey;they were supportive and there for me if I had questions. Its a fun place to be and Ive made so many new friends along the way!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Heather has been there cheering me on from Day 1. She believed in me and motivated me to always keep pushing. When I look at her story and see the success that shes had because of Beachbody, its truly been an inspiration for me.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?Im a 365er (well, in March I will be!). I never miss a day of Shakeology, and Ive done the 3-Day Refresh several times and had great results. Shakeology has helped reduce my cravings, gives me more energy, and keeps me fuller longer throughout the day. I look forward to my shake every morning for breakfast!2Tell us about your experience with Beachbody On Demand.

Transformation Tuesday: Angela Lost 20 Pounds With 21 Day Fix
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/uncategorized/21-day-fix-results,"Before starting 21 Day Fix, Angela struggled with working out and had horrible eating habits. After completing the program, she lost 20 pounds and is now an expert on portion control! Here is what she had to say about her journey.Before the 21 Day Fix, I had tried other programs but to no avail. I was disappointed in myself. Being pregnant with my third child really did damage to my body, and instead of going forward, I was going backwards. So, I finally decided to try the program and work out. By the second week, I started to see results! Seeing improvements at such an early stage in the program pushed me to continue.The workouts were easy to follow and were different every day. Autumn is awesome! She articulates clearly and motivates you. I felt as if she was in my living room, physically training with me. The meal plan was easy to follow as well, and the containers were a big plus for someone like me. I had no clue whatsoever about portion control or what fruits were best for me. The 21 Day Fix meal plan laid it all out and was simple to follow.Im in love with my results! My body shrunk completely, mostly in my mid-section. I no longer have to worry about tucking in my stomach and I am now comfortable in my clothing. I get tons of reactions from friends and family. Some even think I got surgery! Its so hard for them to believe that I was able to get into shape in such little time. I just laugh about it and tell them to follow my 21 Day Fix journey on Facebook.I am glad I did not give up, and Im proud of myself for completing the program!You can change your life, too.

Trying to Save Money? Don’t Skip Your Workouts
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/trying-to-save-money-dont-skip-your-workouts,"If youre trying to save money, you know that sometimes you have to get a little creative to cut your monthly bills. Limitingyour latte habit is one way to tighten your budget, and you might even consider cancelling your current exercise plan.But according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, you might want to think twice before cutting back on your workouts in an attempt to save some dough. Not exercising could end up costing you a lot of money in the long run.Researchers analyzed the 2012 results from the annual Medical Expenditure Panel Survey that surveyed 38,974 men and women to see if there was a connection between inactivity and spend on health care. For the purposes of this study, researchers excluded the data from individuals younger than 18 as well as those who were underweight, pregnant, or able to walk up fewer than 10 steps.They then sorted the data of the remaining 26,239 individuals into two groups: those answered yes to the survey question do you currently spend half hour or more in moderate to vigorous physical activity, at least five times a week? and those who answered no.In this study, moderate and vigorous physical activity were defined as thus: Moderate physical activity causes only light sweating or a slight or moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as fast walking, raking leaves, mowing the lawn, or heavy cleaning. Vigorous physical activity causes heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as running, race walking, lap swimming, aerobic classes, or fast bicycling.Individuals were also classified based on their level of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular modifiable risk factor (CRF). Those with three or more CRFs were profiled as poor and those with two were profiled average. Those with one or no risk factors were profiled as optimal.Even after adjusting for covariates (demographics, insurance type, socioeconomic status, etc.) the researchers found that the largest average difference in how much someone spent each year on health costs was between those who had CVD and nonoptimal physical activity levels and those with optimal CRF and optimal physical activity levels.Those with CVD and non-optimal physical activity levels spent an adjusted average of $9,419 more every year ($12,659 vs. $3,240). The average adjusted difference in spending between who had CVD and optimal physical activity levels and those who had CVD and nonoptimal physical activity levels was $2,500. (You might have seen that number flying around the interwebs.)The study also noticed a significant cost savings between individuals who had optimal CRF and optimal levels of physical activity and those who werent as physically active. The savings there? $493.Since this was an associational study, it cant confirm that regular exercise causes someone to spend less on health care, it only shows that the two are linked. Still, the numbers suggest that adding regular physical activity to your routine should pay off.For overall cardiovascular health, the American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days per week for a total of 150 minutes or at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days per week for a total of 75 minutes; or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. For additional health benefits they suggest adding moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week.Looking for an alternative to walking or running, and still dont want to pay an arm and a leg for a gym membership? Check out Beachbody On Demand, which offers tons of beginner, intermediate, and advanced workouts for less than $13 a month!"

Is Wild Rice the Healthiest Type of Rice?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-wild-rice-the-healthiest-type-of-rice,"Get ready to have your mind go poof. Even though everyone and their mom thinks that brown rice is the best rice for your body, theres another option out there thats worth a taste.Say hello to wild rice. Technically, this dark, nutty grain is actually a type of grass. But if it looks like rice, and it cooks like rice, then hey! No big thing.Heres what makes it so awesome, plus how to get your fill.What Is the Healthiest Type of Rice?Lets picture wild, brown, and white rice sitting on a (delicious) spectrum. On the healthier end of the spectrum sits wild rice: Compared to the others, the grass is lower in calories, and delivers more protein to help you stay fuller longer, says registered dietitian Alex Caspero. It also packs a whopping 30 times more antioxidants than the white variety.White rice is at the other end of the spectrum. Because its been stripped of its nutrient-rich outer hull, it has the least amount of fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Nutritionally speaking, its pretty similar to white pasta, Caspero says.Brown rice is somewhere in the middle. Though if you had to give a precise location, it would probably sit closer to wild rice than to white. Its still a good source of fiber, and it offers up most of the same vitamins and minerals found in wild rice.If youre a numbers person, heres how it all breaks down (per one cup cooked):Wild rice: 121 calories, 6.5 g protein, 3 g fiberBrown rice: 218 calories, 4.5 g protein, 3.5 g fiberWhite rice: 205 calories, 4 g protein, .5 g fiberShould You Avoid Other Types of Rice?Wild rice has a lot to offer, so its definitely worth adding to your diet. Use it in grain salads or pilafs, for stuffing Portobello mushroom caps or winter squash, or in soups. You could even try grinding uncooked wild rice and using it as a crunchy, gluten-free coating for fish, suggests the Whole Grains Council.Thats not to say that you need to bid farewell to brown rice, though. Its like comparing apples to blueberries, Caspero says. Blueberries contain more antioxidants, but both are healthy options. It doesnt mean that apples arent still a great choice.So instead of thinking about dinner (or breakfast, or lunch) solely in terms of which grain is healthiest, balance the nutritional stuff with your personal preferences. So many foods are healthy choices. Dont stress about choosing the healthiest one all the time, Caspero says.Its even fine for white rice to have an occasional spot in your rotation. Just balance things out by pairing it with nutrient-dense foods. Just as theres a difference between pasta marinara and pasta alfredo, theres a difference between white rice with vegetables in a light sauce and white rice with butter, says Caspero. Psst  if you really do want fettuccine alfredo, heres a healthy one.Doesnt Rice Contain Arsenic?Of course, no food is perfect  not even wild rice. Like brown and white rice, tests show that wild rice absorbs small amounts of arsenic that occur naturally in the soil and water.The FDA has long monitored arsenic levels in rice, and recently proposed safety limits on rice-based products, such as infant rice cereal, for babies and young children. They also recommend that pregnant women eat a variety of foods and whole grains to offset the potential risks of arsenic in rice (though theres no official limit for how much rice pregnant women should eat).But adults who eat a well-rounded diet arent at risk, and according to the FDA, consumers dont need to worry about changing their rice consumption. But if youre concerned, here are two ways to reduce your exposure:Cook your rice like pasta. Findings show that cooking rice in a large amount of boiling water (six to 10 parts water to one part rice) and draining it can reduce the amount of arsenic in your rice by up to 60 percent.Mix things up. Enjoy rice a few times a week, but round things out with other whole grains, too, such as quinoa, buckwheat, or millet."

How did you feel about yourself and your body?I started 21 Day Fix when my 4th baby was only 7 weeks old.4 I was 45 pounds overweight, feeling depressed, and had even scheduled a doctors appointment for two weeks out to hopefully get put on anti-depressants. I had no energy, and most days I had to will myself to get out of bed. I couldnt stand how I looked in the mirror to the point that I turned my full length mirror in the bathroom around, so when I walked past it, I didnt have to see myself.

I was so badly out of shape.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?After my very first workout, I noticed an improvement in my overall mood.

I saw amazing results by incorporating plyos with 21 Day Fix EXTREME. I very quickly moved onto The Masters Hammer and Chisel. I loved the variety of workouts in H&C and the strength training with Sagi got me motivated to do Body Beast. I am now doing 22 Minute Hard Corps daily for my HIIT cardio hybrid with Body Beast weight training.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program.

I am turning 40 this year, and I am in the best shape of my life.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Participating in Cristy Owens Challenge Groups helped me stay accountable and gave me the inspiration by watching others be successful.

Is Sushi Healthy?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-sushi-healthy,"The long and short: It depends. Sushi can be a nutrient-dense, power-packed meal thats high in protein. But, if youre not careful, it can be a significant source of unhealthy fats, sodium, and calories.I mean, we get it. Sushi can seem like a healthy go-to; its fish, rice, and seaweed, right? True. But, like many other cuisines, the traditional version is subject to Western culinary interpretation. Soy sauce too plain? Amp it up with some sugar-spiked brown glaze. Raw fish unappetizing? Coat it with breading and drop it in the deep-fryer. Roe too strange to top a roll with? Add texture with deep-fried panko flakes.Of course, sushi comes in all shapes and sizes and can vary greatly from restaurant to restaurant. Energy-wise, were talking 150600+ calories per roll, and thats without the brown glazes, cream cheese, or mayonnaise-laden fillings. A basic spicy tuna roll, for instance, is made with tuna, rice, seaweed, sriracha, and mayo and weighs in at about 290 calories.Also, lets keep it real: Who eats just one roll of sushi for dinner?! Thats like ordering a small salad with dressing on the side, and then gobbling half of your dates fries.To keep sushi from becoming a diet buster, follow these tips when ordering your next roll:Go brown. Ask for your sushi to be made with brown instead of white rice. Brown rice is higher in fiber (to keep you regular) and lower on the glycemic index, meaning it wont spike your blood sugar as much as the white stuff. According to Chef Bobby Calabrese from the new cooking show FIXATE, starring 21 Day Fix celebrity trainer Autumn Calabrese, Many people use brown rice as a substitute, which is good, but we took it a step further and designed a quinoa-based sushi roll that is a perfect match for [Beachbodys] nutritional goals.One roll of sushi can contain up to 1 cup of rice, which adds about 160 calories and 37 grams of carbohydrates. Again, we feel you on the more-than-one-roll thing. We know you dont have the appetite of a toddler. Keep reading for our portion control tip.Skip the sauce. Spicy mayo, eel sauce, soy sauce, oh my. The fat, sugar, and salt adds up when sushi is topped with condiments. Youre almost heading into cheeseburger territory if you get all the saucy, creamy, crunchy bells and whistles. To keep it light, go easy on the sauces and opt for ginger and wasabi. Dip  dont dunk  your roll or nigiri in lower-sodium soy sauce (the one with the green top) to slash some sodium.Eat protein. Many fishes can be excellent sources of protein, but to get the biggest bang for your buck, choose omega-3 rich fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, and eel. These fatty fishes are among the few sources of vitamin D in the diet. If youre squeamish (or pregnant), stay away from raw and choose steamed or grilled sushi over fried (aka tempura) options.Control portions. Keep portions in check by ordering one roll, and add a healthy appetizer or two to satisfy your appetite. A roll of sushi contains about six pieces of fish, ranging from 25100 calories per bite! If youre still hungry after one roll, add some ginger or seaweed salad, edamame, or miso soup. Some sashimi  simple slices of raw fish  can also help fill the belly.Opt for healthy fats. Fats help to keep you full, but not all are created equal. Choose sushi rolls with avocado, and skip the ones with cream cheese, mayo, eel sauce, and those fried in oil. We know these can be the temptresses of the sushi bar, but once you get used to eating less gussied up Japanese fare, those wacky rolls will start to look like celebrities who wear too much makeup.Up the veg. To get more filling vegetables in, order a veggie sushi roll (theyre usually lower calorie, too). Traditional veggie sushi is filled with cucumber, carrots, and avocado. Please your palate with extra pizzazz from rolls, called futomaki, made with pickled vegetables.So yes, sushi can be healthy if youre savvy about how you order."

Hammer and Chisel Results: Katherine Lost 25 Pounds and Won $1,500!

She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I had successfully lost weight with 21 Day Fix and felt stronger after completing both the fix and PiYo. I felt good but I didnt feel like I had much muscle tone and I couldnt do a pull-up to save my life. I mean, I wouldnt be a very good apocalypse buddy if I cant even pull myself up, right?! My lack of upper body strength has really limited me in life. After I had my son, I could hardly hold him. My shoulder wasnt supposed to hold anything over 10 lbs and my son was born at 9 lbs 11oz!4 It was a really tough struggle for me. We wanted more children and I just couldnt see my weak body making it through another pregnancy. I was so sad during and after pregnancy. I felt so helpless to my circumstances, like a victim. After that experience, I never wanted to feel that way about myself again. I felt tired and much older than I should have at that point in my life.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I wanted to be healthy for my family! I wanted to be able to crawl around with my son and keep up with him during play time. I needed to have more energy and couldnt stand being stagnant anymore. I had a fairly active lifestyle, and was a full-time bedside nurse, pre-baby but I didnt know how to eat right, so as soon as my activity dropped due to a rough pregnancy, I gained a ton of weight and really started losing the will to live. Thats not the dream I had in mind when I was a kid. Grow up, get pregnant, grow stagnant, suffer through depression, then die that picture was not what I wanted to see for myself! I saw that future and that path ahead of me and it scared me. I decided to stop that. I looked to my friends and family that were living positive, healthy life that I wanted. I watched them and started rebuilding relationships. That was pre-beachbody; as soon as Beachbody showed up for me, I was hooked. It was everything I needed to start and succeed!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?I was stuck at a plateau. 160 was definitely a lot less than I started with but my body wasnt nearly close to where I wanted it to be. I had weak muscles, a busted left shoulder, and damaged right knee.3 My 30 pound 2-year-old was starting to get too heavy for me to lift comfortably, so I knew I needed to build some muscle and get my core in better shape. I also hadnt done much high-impact yet and my body was not too tolerant of any high-impact workouts which is awful because running is a hobby of mine! Thanks to the conditioning from Hammer and Chisel, I can jump the bench now! I can do the plyo jumps! I can hold a plank and tap! I can even do pull-ups! Thats huge! Beachbody overall helped me with my diet challenge! I literally hadnt ever learned how to eat correctly, even through nursing school, it wouldnt stick. I needed to grow and be honest with myself. I learned this all with the portion control system and the advice Ive received from team Beachbody! It has been a phenomenal journey.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I loved the calendar. The set up kept me interested and busy! I never felt like I hadnt done enough after a Hammer and Chisel workout, and their quotes are hilarious! I enjoyed the motivation and inspiration that Sagi and Autumn provided. I learned a lot about myself during the second round of this program. I had already been through it once, so I knew the moves and had the muscle memory, I really liked how hard it helped me push myself. My favorite part about the program is how instructive the trainers are on form. Ive been hurt by personal trainers, yet never during my workouts with Beachbody and Im pushing harder and lifting heavier than I ever have. This is the way to go!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I reached my goal weight, Im below my pre-pregnancy weight now, and I (our whole household) am overall entirely healthier than I was prior to starting the program! I lost a noticeable amount of weight and inches. I am so very proud of completing this program, start to finish. I achieved so many measurable results but the most important of them is how accomplished I feel. Being able to do pull-ups has always been a goal of mine but I never knew how to work up to the, until this program, and now I can do pull-ups for a full minute! I am proud of the jumps I can do now, how strong my body is. My very last day, very last move, I was able to pull a 30 lb dumbbell over my head! That was unthinkable a minute before I did it. I couldnt do that with a 5 lb weight when I started, it caused too much pain. I can do clockwork pushups! I remember falling out of that the first day and wondering how I would ever make it, I am most proud of the mindset shift I attained during this program.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I cant even begin to tell you. My entire life is completely different than it was prior to Beachbody. I know that sounds cheesy but this literally saved me! I was a wreck. I needed something to hold on to, I needed someone to tell me to get off my butt, get in gear, and lose the crap excuses for not doing what I needed to do to be happy and healthy! I am forever grateful and just want to pay all the good feelings forward. I am a registered nurse and Ive never helped people be well. I helped sick people get better; helped them mask greater issues with medications or surgeries. Now I get to help people grow from the inside out. They blossom from sadness or worthlessness into life-loving people with their programs and personal development. My family life has changed. I feel gratitude rather than negativity. Everyone in my house is healthier and happier now! Thank you for helping me making this all possible.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Participating in and running challenge groups really helped me stay accountable because I felt like I needed to hit those workouts early to keep my challengers motivated. I also didnt want to disappoint them or myself, so it helped me a lot. We share recipes and tips, too, for staying focused to hit our goalsHow did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Caitlynn has been absolutely wonderful! The Coach that personally sponsored me originally, quit recently and hadnt been a leader to us at all. So I was really just doing my own thing. Caitlynn invited me into her Challenge Group, creates motivating videos for us, and recognizes us for success. Shes awesome!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Shakeology has done wonders for me! It lifted my mommy-fog! I have energy like I have never had before! Recover has helped maintain my muscle growth and repair, and I noticed significant decrease in soreness when I take it. Hydrate completely eliminated my leg pain. It wasnt soreness but a deep pain I would feel, like electrolyte imbalances. Hydrate solved that problem for me and it tastes great. Energize is the only pre-workout I can drink. I usually get really jittery and feel like Im going to pass out with pre-workout supplements so I stopped drinking them. I tried energize in a packet and I am in love. It gives me energy to dive into my workout and push for that extra rep without making me feel chest pain and a racing heart! The performance products have been a huge win. I used a 3-Day Refresh between rounds, I feel like that set me up for great results my second round. My body felt clean and light after that. All these products and programs support each other well.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

What is Cupping Therapy?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/wellness/what-is-cupping-therapy,"If youve watched any of the captivating performances in Rio this past week, you might have found yourself feeling slightly concerned for some of the athletes. From swimmers to gymnasts, the backs of many competitors were decorated with large red circles.No, there isnt some weird disease going around. Those splotchy dots are intentional. It comes from an old Chinese medicine method called cupping, a form of myofascial release. Its different from massage or foam rolling in that instead of pressing and compressing, its decompressing and creating space, explains acupuncturist Janet Lee, L.Ac., DACM. Cupping has been around for thousands of years and has become noticeably popular among athletes, even though the science behind the practice is the subject of some debate.How Does Cupping Therapy Work?There are a few different cupping methods, one of which involves pricking the skin to draw blood (this is known as wet cupping), but one of the most common techniques uses glass cups. Lee explains that a cotton ball soaked in alcohol is placed inside the glass cup and lit on fire. This removes the air and creates a vacuum. The cotton ball is then removed, and the cup is placed directly on the skin, where it lifts up the skin. This creates space between the skin and the fascia (the connective tissue encasing muscles), and is said to help boost blood flow and relieve muscle tension.When you have an injury there will be bleeding and edema (fluid that causes swelling) in the area, Lee says. According to Lee, The dark color on the skin is from the cupping lifting out some of that stagnant blood, cellular debris, and lymph that never cleared. In most cases, the cupping marks are just lightly red from superficial capillaries being broken, which is not dangerous or even painful.Does Cupping Therapy Work?Although Olympic gold medalists swear by this ancient technique, not everyone is convinced that that it actually helps improve athletic performance. A 2012 review looked at 135 randomized controlled trials and found that the scientific evidence doesnt support the efficacy of cupping for anything beyond shingles, acne, facial paralysis, and cervical spondylosis. Another review from 2011, which looked at fewer studies, came to the conclusion that cupping may be effective for reducing some pain conditions and shingles, but adds that there are still doubts that remain about this conclusion, and more testing should be done.Is Cupping Therapy Safe?Despite the need for more research, Lee says that most people who enjoy a massage can benefit from cupping, and she compares the sensation to getting a deep tissue or sports massage. Although cupping might not be extremely painful, there are some cautions you should take with this practice. Sometimes you can get blisters, and a common thing with the glass cups is the edge can get hot and burn the skin, Lee says. You dont want to do cupping when you have a fever or cold, if you have bleeding issues, and if youre pregnant, you shouldnt do it around your abdomen or back.If youre interesting in trying this kind of myofascial release, Lee says to be sure to go to a licensed practitioner. Just like with a massage, you want to go to someone who knows what they are doing."

Beachbody Results: Brittany Lost 32 Pounds with CIZE and PiYo!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-brittany-lost-32-pounds-with-cize-and-piyo,"Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort.Brittany Preston, age 28, lost 32 lbs with CIZE and PiYo. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I had just had my second baby, and although I didnt gain as much weight as I did during my first pregnancy, I certainly felt like I had. I was uncomfortable in my skin, and my confidence was in the gutter.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I had lost all of the baby weight after having my first child, so after having my second, I wanted to get back there so badly. Hating the reflection staring back you in the mirror is an awful feeling. As do most new moms, I just wanted my body back! So I ordered CIZE to ease back into working out. I did a few rounds of that, and finished up with PiYo, which I love.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Eating healthy and finding time to workout. There were any times I pushed play and had both of my sons crawling around on the floor with me during PiYo. My toddler even joined in on the dancing with CIZE, which was fun for both of us! The nutrition guide was an amazing help for me. It offered lots of variety, and good food. Not crappy diet food. Shakeology was great for me as well. I love the way it makes me feel. Beachbody has truly changed my life!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I loved CIZE because its so much fun. I got a great workout, while dancing and having a good timewhat more can you ask for? I love PiYo because its low impact, but still offers a killer workout. I was sore in places I didnt know I had muscle! The workouts are doable. They are relatively short, and as a mommy of two under the age of two, that was key for me!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Im so proud of reaching my goal of losing my baby weight and fitting into my pants againthey are actually big on me! My body is more toned than it has been, perhaps ever. Thats a great accomplishment for me. The results I have achieved have blown my mind.

Beachbody Results: Amber Lost 43 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-amber-lost-46-pounds-and-won-1500,"Amber Brockwell, age 33, lost 43 lbs with 21 Day Fix and CIZE. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Oops, I did it again! Where do I begin? 3 years ago, I was ready to find myself again. I was extremely overweight, and I almost lost my then 9-year-old son to respiratory arrest from a life threatening asthma attack. As I saw him lying in the hospital bed in a coma on a ventilator, I knew it was time to take charge of my life so I could be the best role model I could possibly be. Fast forward a few weeks after we got home, and I was fortunate to run across a package of Chalean DVDs. It had everything I needed to get started. Turbo Jam, ChaLEAN Extreme, and Turbo Fire. So I gave it a shot and thought, Well maybe Ill lose a few pounds. When it was all said and done, I ending up losing over 80 pounds. Let me give you a little background on my life. I have the most amazing son that was born in 2004. My husband and I tried for over 10 years to give him a sibling, and have another child. We never had any luck. When I had given up all hope, I ended up pregnant. And I 100% believe that it was due to the fact that I had taken control of my life. My small frame was no longer supporting all of the excess weight, and I no longer had high blood pressure. I was elated to finally be pregnant again. We were blessed with a beautiful daughter in August of 2014. Due to sleepless nights, and caring for this beautiful bundle of joy, I stopped focusing on myself. But guess what happens when you stop leading a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and exercise? Thats right, you gain weight. And that I did. I gained every bit of it back. It is now time to focus on myself again. And I had no doubt on where I needed to turn to get my life back. I went immediately to Beachbody. I truly believe in them, and their products. I knew they helped me before, and they could help me take control of my life again. I knew I had to focus on portion control (which was out of hand for me), and I had to start a great workout again, one that I would look forward to doing. This time I turned to 21 Day Fix and CIZE. And let me tell you that I wholeheartedly know that I made the right decision. Within my first round, my energy sky rocketed and I lost many, many inches. With trainers like Shaun T and Autumn, I know they have my back. As odd as that may seem, although they are in my TV screen, I feel they are friends of mine. And they truly care about helping others and it is their passion and their gift they give to others. Thank you Beachbody for helping me gain my health back for a second time!What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?3 years ago I watched my little boy fight for his life. He was on a ventilator in a coma due to respiratory arrest from an extremely severe asthma attack. I vowed to be the best role model for him. That is when I first decided to take my life back. After putting all of my weight back on from my last pregnancy, and knowing that I now have a daughter to look up to me, I without a doubt have to set a positive example for her. I want her to grow up and always love herself and her body and to always be confident.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The greatest challenge for myself was realizing that it is okay to put myself first. It is okay to focus on my health and wellness. I have to take care of me in order to take care of my family. I have to be able to pour from a full cup. I cant pour from an empty cup. The Beachbody team, trainers, and programs all taught me that.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I dont even know where to begin. I love everything about it! 21 Day Fix got my nutrition to be on point, which I definitely needed help with. I would binge eat in front of the TV for hours, not paying attention to what I was putting in my body one bit. It taught me that healthy foods can be delicious, and if they are perfectly proportioned you never feel hungry. It is a no brainier when it comes to portion control. I love working out with Autumn. I trusted the process and her, and thought of her as a friend. She really pushes you and makes you feel strong. Plus I connected with her knowing she is a mom. I also loved the rotation of the workouts every day, because my body never became used to it. It was constantly changing.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I can now look at myself in the mirror now and love who is looking back at me. Before I couldnt even look at myself in the mirror because I was disgusted with what I had done to myself. I had no one to blame except me. I can now say I love myself again and I no longer have to hide. I can now walk into a room and hold my head high. I have found myself again. I am now leading by example to my kids, which is most important. Overall my blood pressure has decreased, which is wonderful! It decreased my overall fat percentages, and took a great amount of weight off of my small frame. I was shocked to see just how fast the pounds started to fall off! The health benefits will pay off in the long run. I do not get easily winded, and I have so much more energy!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I no longer turn the other way when I see someone in a store that I know. I dont have to be embarrassed with the way I look. I am confident in myself again. I can chase my young daughter and my son again without getting winded. I am active, energetic and happy again. I never wanted my daughter or my son to grow up listening to me complain about my body, and put myself down. I want them to have a confident mom so they can grow up and always be confident and love themselves. That is especially so important to a young girl.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Yes! Yes! Yes! Challenge Groups are simply incredible. It is a community of people that support and encourage each other. You are surrounded by people that are in the same boat as yourself, and you all genuinely want to see each other succeed. The groups keep you accountable, and you make lifelong friends who share the same passion.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey? I cant say enough kind words about my Coach. She is simply one strong and beautiful woman inside and out. I actually first connected with her through Facebook and followed her for a while. She has a passion for what she does and I look up to her. She knows how to lift you up and make you believe in yourself. I knew that she was meant to be the coach for me. She is an incredible person.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Mmmm, Shakeology. It is unbelievable. It always gives me a great pick me up and tastes wonderful! I never had to guess on what I needed to put into my body. There are so many ways you can prepare it and change it up. My body can tell when I skip a day. When I do, my energy levels drop dramatically, I feel sluggish, and my appetite is harder to control. It also helps my digestive issues by drinking it. My son loves it too! In the beginning it tasted so good I almost felt like I was cheating. I had to keep reminding myself that it is healthy! I recommend it to everyone. Between the shakes and the programs, I found myself with less stress, wonderful peaceful sleep at night, and my blood pressure has improved.3Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)I used to have problems sleeping at night, and now I sleep like a baby! My joints are no longer sore.You can change your life, too.

Beachbody Results: Erin Lost 85 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-erin-lost-85-pounds-and-won-1000,"Erin Baehr, age 50, lost 85 lbs with 21 Day Fix, 21 Day Fix EXTREME, and The Masters Hammer and Chisel. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I have struggled with weight issues and body image since my teen years (Im 49). After a bout in college with anorexia and bulimia, I found a healthy balance in eating and fitness when pregnant with my oldest son. I maintained that balance until about 12 years ago. After losing my only brother to suicide in 2004, I turned to food to cope and numb the feelings of grief and my weight began to creep up. My unhealthy coping skills continued as I dealt with the stress of starting a financial planning and tax business, supporting my husband through Cancer, and caring for my daughter who was bedridden on-and-off for 6 years with a chronic illness. I often joked that the first 5 cookies didnt help, but I was sure the next 5 would. As my weight ballooned, my confidence plummeted. I was self conscious and missed out on many opportunities because I was too embarrassed to be seen. I felt weighed down, both physically and emotionally.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?Over the years, I tried so many times to diet and lose the weight. Most of the time I couldnt even get going, but the times I did I was quickly derailed by the new crisis of the week. I finally resigned myself that this is who I was now. In the beginning of 2015, some things happened to convince me to give it one more try. My doctor got my long standing sleep issues under control, giving me more energy than I had in years. A friend saw a picture of me and my grandson from two years past and asked who that was, because he didnt recognize me. I was so embarrassed. I watched another friend (a Beachbody Coach) as she shared her weight loss journey. I knew her life was super busy, and was intrigued by how she managed it. My sons August wedding was quickly approaching as well. Staring down another stressful year, I knew I had a choice to make. I could continue down the same road and gain even more weight, or I could do something different and lose it instead.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?After eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted for so many years, I had lost all perspective on what normal eating was. I knew that a diet was not going to work for me, that if this was going to be successful it had to be a lifestyle change. I decided that would come only by eating like I did when I was thin- but the question remained, how? My friend shared with me that her success came from the 21 Day Fix and how it fit right into real life. When my containers arrived and I read the plan, I knew she was right. The containers helped me to relearn portion sizes and an appropriate amount of food to eat in a day. I couldnt believe how little cheese was allowed; I had been eating about a dozen times that before starting the plan! It was simple to understand and put into practice, both at home and when eating out. I was not hungry a bit, and knew this was a lifestyle I could keep. Not once did I feel like I couldnt wait to be done so I could go back to eating like before.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I loved the containers with the 21 Day Fix as I mentioned, but I also appreciated that the workouts were only 30 minutes long. I started in February, in the height of my busy tax season at work but still was able to find that 30 minutes every day. Autumn is encouraging and motivating, and I hear her voice in my head even when Im not doing the workouts (nobody quits! you can do anything for 60 seconds! be better than you were yesterday!). I loved that I could see changes in my body so quickly; it helped motivate me to keep it going. Having a plan for what workout to do each day was invaluable, and I enjoyed seeing my progress in the workouts as they cycled back around again the following week. After several months of the 21 Day Fix, I felt comfortable with heavy weights and no modifications, so I moved up to 21 Day Fix EXTREME in October. My muscle growth and weight loss exploded with that program. The progress was incredible and I love how Autumn pushes even more in EXTREME.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?When I started my journey, I wore an XX-L and likely was in a size 20. I refused to buy new clothes and I was wearing two pairs of very seriously stretched out size 16 pants. I have lost 85 pounds and 66 inches and am in a size 4! More than that, I am happy to be strong and healthy. A year ago I could barely get up the stairs at home without being short of breath and pains in my knees and feet. Now I bound up those stairs! At 50 lbs lost in October, I wanted to run a lap just to see if I could. Ive been running regularly since, now over 20 miles a week . The friend who didnt recognize me in the picture challenged me to run 3 miles in under 30 minutes, and on January 2, we went to the track and I did it! Im proudest though that for the first time in my life I have a healthy relationship with food. I found better ways to handle stress, I express my feelings instead of numbing them, and reward myself with positive things for my health rather than food.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?If you said to me a year ago that i would own running shoes, workout clothes, a treadmill, or dumbbells I would have thought you were crazy! But here I am, working out just about every day and loving it. On the eating side of things, I see food as fuel now, and make choices in what I eat based on how it will make my body feel, not what will satisfy my sugar cravings. I can look at a piece of cake and willingly without regret pass on it, or even have a piece if I want it- but it doesnt set me off on a junk food binge anymore. Im healthy, energetic, and happy. I no longer dread getting dressed in the morning because of how my clothes fit, because they all look great! My increased confidence has been great for me professionally too; I am more outgoing and dont want to hide. My daughter is eating better and exercising too, which has improved her illness as well. The positive change in me is apparent to my family and friends, and more than once Ive even been told Im glowing.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?I knew for quite some time that my weight was a health and quality of life issue, but had a hard time getting motivated to stick with a plan for more than a few days, or get started at all. Being in the group gave me the structure I needed to start, and the encouragement of the group helped me continue. I knew each day we would be facing the same challenges and doing the same workouts, and that the group would be looking for me to report in. I didnt want to disappoint my fellow challengers!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Ive known my Coach Meg Watt for a number of years, and when she started her weight loss journey I watched with interest. I knew she had an incredibly busy life, and if the plan fit into her life, it could fit into mine. She encouraged me that the plan was workable with real life, and invited me to join the group. She helped me figure out 21 Day Fix and checked in with me periodically to see my progress. Meg was ever encouraging and cheered me on.You can change your life, too.

Ultimate Reset Results: This New Mom Got Back in Shape in 21 Days!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/ultimate-reset-results-this-new-mom-got-back-in-shape-in-21-days,"Nina Millan, age 32, lost 20 lbs in 21 days with Ultimate Reset. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Life before the reset was very difficult for me. I recently had a baby, and the pregnancy was very hard on me.4 I had gestational diabetes and hypertension. I delivered safely, but a few months after birth I started gaining weight rapidly, despite attempting to eat healthy and trying to commit to regular exercise. As a new mom I felt tired, sluggish, and like I was existing in a fog. My thoughts werent clear, I looked like I had aged, my hair was thinning, my skin looked blotchy, and I had regular breakouts. Exercising was very difficult, and I suffered from digestive pain and cramping on a regular basis. Also, my cravings for sugar were at an all time high. And since I had GD while pregnant I was now at risk for developing diabetes later on in my life. I really felt that now after having 2 kids, I would never have the body I always wanted.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?In the last few years I lost my best friend to diabetes, my mother to RA, and my grandmother. But having struggles again after giving birth, something clicked. I realized that I couldnt keep living with this hurt and weight. This was such a happy time in my life finally after so much loss. The prospect of starting a new family renewed my faith in life and the fact that I knew I would be needed now more than ever before. I wanted to be a positive role model for my children and feel like I could be at my best for them. I like to think of myself as a second time success story with Beachbody. Beachbody has never failed me! I believe in the programs and products and its proof that if you commit to yourself and to the plan you will succeed. But this time I wanted to be in better shape and better health than before. The Ultimate Reset was going to allow me to be my best self yet, and I believed now that I was starting a new life, it was time to achieve a new level of optimal health.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Food addiction. Food has always been my struggle; it has always been a war where I would advance, and retreat. It always seemed like two steps forward and ten steps back, when I was off my game. I knew that I would not reach my goal if I didnt deal with the demon that was my food issue. So the first thing I did was read the program guide from front to back. I needed to enforce the foundation of what good health was in my mind. So the next thing I did was throw out all my old take out containers that reminded me of bad choices, and I replaced them with new clean containers in portioned controlled sizes. This allowed me to prep all my foods for the week, and take my lunch everyday. The Reset made me organized with my eating overnight! I went to the farmers market before my first day, and was amazed at how much food I could buy for three people.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I loved the meals! Wow, so easy and fresh. I also loved how I felt each week. I noticed that after the first week I was sleeping better and more sound. I noticed how alert I felt at work. When everyone wanted snacks like chocolate or cookies, I had my greens (my favorite by the way!) and was totally fine. There was no guesswork with the Reset. Since everything was on a schedule, all you needed to do was to follow it. I also loved how budget friendly everything was. I was able to feed my family of 4 for the duration of the Reset on $200! Before the reset we would spend $200 a week on groceries. My wallet was very happy! Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I was amazed with my results! My sleep improved, my cravings are gone, my skin looks amazing, and I dont feel hungry all the time. The biggest shift has been in my mood. I dont feel anxious or scatter brained at times. And I am visibly slimmer, and fit into clothes I havent worn since 2014! I gained back a few dress sizes, and 3 belt loops, now that my waist is smaller. I am most proud of the fact that I got organized and stuck with it! That has been the hardest thing for me. My family feels better now that our meals are more organized and prepared. And I know that I am making my daughter proud of me when shes sees how happy and vibrant I have become over the last 3 weeks. The cloud of sadness and loss has faded and made way for a more confidant, healthy me, from the inside out.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?Well, for the first time in years, I now pack my lunch every day. Its automatic for me now, and I dont event want to spend money on lunch knowing I might be caught out there waiting for Mr. Food Addiction. There is no temptation to make bad choices. I fit in my old clothes again, and I have been feeling amazing every day since I finished the Reset. My family has grown stronger now that we are all more active in planning our meals together. My daughter enjoys flipping through the meal plan, and coming up with ways to spice up the existing recipes in a healthy way. And I am showing my son new foods to try. Doing this will impact them for the rest of their lives. I am most proud of that. And for the first time since having a baby, I feel like I will achieve the fitness I have always wanted because I am working on my biggest problem, food addiction.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Challenge Groups are an amazing way to stay connected to the core purpose of why you want to make an active change. My Challenge Group started with a few women who were all like me, addicted to food. The most fun thing about them was sharing the recipes and posting pictures of the food, also how our refrigerator looked before and after getting organized. Challenge Groups are a must have to be accountable and successful!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey? My Coach is not active, but I have other team members that cheered me on. Honestly the Coach that helped me the most is my husband Neftali Millan. He was my rock, helping to prepare meals, giving me encouragement and doing the Reset with me. He was hands down the reason why I had such success.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?The supplements were awesome. They gave me energy and clearly they worked! I really love the taste of the greens, reminded me of eating spinach which is one of my favorites!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?The biggest change was my eating issue.

Healthier Fettuccine Alfredo
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/healthier-fettuccine-alfredo,"Pasta is a dish that tugs at your heartstrings. My mouth waters thinking about a steaming plate of hot pasta  and lets not forget about the freshly grated Parmesan cheese that melts on top. One of my favorite types of pasta is fettuccine alfredo. I love how the creamy garlicky sauce coats each noodle. Its the type of dish you never get tired of, and its always a crowd pleaser at the dinner table.According to lore, this dish was created by Alfredo Di Lelio in 1914 as an attempt to please his pregnant, nauseated wife. The original version was made with butter and Parmesan cheese, not cream, and this tradition continues outside of the U.S. When Di Lelio and his family moved to New York, he opened a restaurant, bringing this dish to the states.Whether the sauce is made with butter and cheese or butter, cheese and cream, its not exactly the lightest option out there. We figured there had to be a way to get that no-compromise flavor without all the cream and butter. And Im happy to report: We did it! This recipe features a healthier version of fettuccine alfredo. No cream, no butter, but all the flavor.The secret? Cauliflower!To make this dish, you start off by cooking your pasta. We opt for a whole-grain fettuccine for added fiber. Once the noodles are cooked, youll want to reserve some of the pasta water for the sauce. If you dont normally add pasta water, its a great trick to use when making pasta sauce. As the noodles cook, theyll release starch into the water. By keeping and using some of the leftover water for the sauce, you can thicken it without the need for added oil or flour.Next, youll prepare the fettuccine sauce. Start by cooking the cauliflower in vegetable broth (for extra flavor). While it cooks, lightly saut garlic and olive oil together. Once the cauliflower is cooked, add it to the blender alongside the garlic, nutmeg and reserved cooking water. A quick trip to the blender will turn the cauliflower into a silky white sauce. Add the sauce back to the pan, stir in some unsweetened almond milk, and just like that you have a healthier fettuccine sauce thats full of flavor. Youd never guess theres cauliflower inside, but it always feels good sneaking in extra vegetables. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.Healthier Fettuccine AlfredoTotal Time: 40 min.Prep Time: 15 min.Cooking Time: 25 min.Yield: 4 servingsIngredients:8 oz. dry whole grain fettuccine3 cups low-sodium organic vegetable broth1 medium cauliflower, chopped (about 1 pounds)2 tsp. olive oil2 cloves garlic, finely chopped1 pinch ground nutmegSea salt (or Himalayan salt) and ground black pepper (to taste; optional) cup unsweetened almond milk cup shredded Parmesan cheese2 Tbsp. chopped flat-leaf parsley (for garnish; optional)Preparation:1.

Beachbody Results: Mom of Two Lost 59 Pounds and Won $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-mom-of-two-lost-59-pounds-and-won-1000,"Samantha Carroll, age 24, lost 59 lbs with 21 Day Fix, INSANITY MAX:30, P90X3, and Shakeology. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I had just given birth to my second son six weeks before starting the 21 Day Fix program. This was my second baby in two years! I used my pregnancies as an excuse to eat anything and everything I wanted. I sat around for nine months straight with my second pregnancy munching on junk food and soda. With the first I was working a very physically demanding job up until eight months but still eating a lot of bad things! After having my 2nd son, it was incredibly hard for me to look at my body in the mirror. I lost over 20 lbs after delivery and was left with all the excess weight from my junk food eating. It was not pretty! Im only 23 years old and I found myself daydreaming about my pre-pregnancy body. Tall, lean, and 140 lbs! Would I ever see that body again? I am so young, will I be stuck like this forever? While I was and still am overjoyed to be a mother to two beautiful baby boys, I was depressed with what I let happen to my once beautiful body. It was much more than a few stretch marks.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My wonderful Coach Maura Kivlin inspired me to begin this journey. She was a former co-worker of mine at a local nursing home. Being her friend on Facebook, I had seen her transformation and I couldnt help but be inspired. She gave birth around the same time as I did with my first son, and she was in phenomenal shape! I had to know how she did it. So I contacted her while still pregnant with my second son and told her I would be joining as soon as I was finished with the pregnancy! She added me to her Facebook accountability group, Team Reformers, at the start of my program and the outpouring of inspiration and motivation within that group is truly amazing. I owe all of my success to everyone in that group for keeping me focused and motivated on what I and everyone there was looking to accomplish. They are wonderful people!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My greatest challenge was the simple fact that, I never stick with anything. Ill try something for a few days, maybe and week, and decide its too hard, too time consuming or some other excuse and quit. That was not the case with the 21 Day Fix. For the first time in my life, I stuck with a program and finished it! Once again, my Coachs accountability group was the key to me sticking with this and staying motivated! I knew I had people counting on me and expecting results! Not to mention, the eating plan for the program is wonderful. Never did I go hungry or feel deprived. Ive learned so much about nutrition and clean eating and I get super excited to find recipes that are not only good for you but taste phenomenal! Why should healthy have to taste bad? Fast forward over a one year after my first round of the 21 Day Fix and Im in the best shape of my life after six rounds of 21DF, two rounds of INSANITY:Max:30, and Im on my last month of P90X3 now!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?The meal plan was a pleasant surprise for me. I was happy to see how many different options I had and how much I could have of each container. It really inspired me to hunt down great recipes to get the best out of each container group and incorporate them all into endless meal possibilities!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Ive lost over 50 lbs and a whole lot of inches. However, just as much as I love how my body is changing, I am super proud of the sheer fact that I finished these programs from start to finish and Im still at it over a year later! This is a first for me and it has really boosted my self esteem.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I have so much more confidence, I am happier, I have more energy to play with my kids and I feel better. I never realized how my eating habits were making me feel like a slug; tired, depressed, lazy and so on. I now feel like I can take on the world these days!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?All of the support from my friends in the group made it so much easier to feel proud of the hard work I was putting in! It truly kept me accountable knowing I had a responsibility as part of the group to do what I was supposed to be doing. Workout everyday, follow the meal plan, and engage with the rest of the group!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Maura Kivlin is simply wonderful! She is so inspirational and really takes the time to pay personal attention to all her Reformers! She is a wonderful Beachbody Coach and I would absolutely recommend her as a Coach to anyone looking to start a Beachbody program!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Shakeology has been a game changer for me! I wasnt able to start using it until a few months ago. I was stuck at a plateau for months on the scale. My body was changing but the scale stopped moving. The scale has finally started moving again and I know its because of Shakeology. It tastes great and I feel great knowing that Im putting amazing super-foods into my body every single day!You can change your life, too.

How did you feel about yourself and your body?I felt tired all the time, and was embarrassed to have my picture taken.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?When I was turning 50, I had done INSANITY in 2012, lost 17 pounds, and felt pretty good.

I stopped the meds cold turkey, and went on a 1200-calorie high-protein, high-fiber diet, did INSANITY and lifted weights, and lost 45 pounds.

This Busy Mom Lost 59 Pounds and Four Dress Sizes!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/this-busy-mom-lost-59-pounds-and-four-dress-sizes,"Jasmin Watkins lost 59 lbs. with FOCUS T25 and Ultimate Reset. She entered her results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Prior to my journey, I was repulsed by my body. I had just given birth to twin sons, and while I loved being a mother, I hated the fact that I still looked pregnant months later. Nothing fit, and I was depressed. I wouldnt go shopping, and I avoided mirrors at all costs. I didnt even want to take pictures, because I was so embarrassed about my body, especially my stomach. I have a condition called diastasis recti, and was told the only way to lose the stomach fat was to get cosmetic surgery. That made me even more depressed. People would always tell me how fat I had gotten, and it hurt me so deeply. To think an experience that was supposed to be so positive made me feel so unattractive and disgusted. I was jealous of all of my friends, and I never wanted to be seen in public. I just wanted to hide.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I had lost weight right before Igot pregnant with my twins, and I knew I could do it. I was tired of being jealous of all of my friends. I was tired of wondering whether my husband could possibly be attracted to me knowing that I was about 90 pounds heavier than when we met. I wanted to be in shape. I wanted to be able to play with my twin sons, and run after them without running out of breath. I just wanted to be a better me. I wanted better health, but I also wanted to look good in my clothes. My confidence was almost nonexistent. One day, a coworker came up to me and told me in front of everyone that I let myself go. At first, I was embarrassed, then enraged, and then motivated. Deep down inside I knew she was right. I no longer could blame the twins for my look nine months later. I was inspired to try something different.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The greatest challenge I faced was finding the time to work out with two newborn sons. I was breastfeeding at the time, and they were also very needy. I also had a nine-year-old daughter in fourth grade that needed assistance. In addition, I was juggling being a wife and a full-time teacher. I also coached dance. It seemed almost impossible at times. With T25 only being 25 minutes, it was perfect for me. Its easy to find 25 minutes during their naptime. Sometimes when the music would come on, they would start to dance. Indirectly, I felt as though they were cheering me on. I felt a new sense of motivation. Nutrition was also a challenge as well. Its hard to cook healthy meals for yourself while cooking other tasty meals for everyone else. I followed the meal guide and used recipes posted in my Challenge Group, which helped me to overcome my challenges. Not to mention, the meals were so tasty, the entire family loved them;it made the process so much easier.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I loved that there was a modifier, because I struggle with jumping. I used to tell people that running and jumping were against my religious beliefs. I hated it that much. The modifier allowed me to keep up, yet I was still drenched in sweat by the time I was done. I loved the moves as well, because it felt like dancing sometimes. What I love most about the program is Shaun T. I love his spirit and positive energy. I love how he is so charismatic. I love how he encourages you, and for a minute, you truly feel as though you are not alone. I truly felt that Shaun T really cared about the people watching the video. He wanted us to be and do our best. He motivated me through a television screen better than trainers at the gym were doing and for a lot less money.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I lost four dress sizes and 59 pounds with FOCUS T25. I feel incredible. I feel lighter; Im sleeping and breathing better;I am not as tired;my energy has skyrocketed; and Im overall just a happier person. Prior to T25, I never thought I could complete an exercise program. I hated exercise. I only liked exercise if it was dance-related. If there wasnt dancing, I wanted nothing to do with it. When I tried T25, I never thought I would actually finish it. The achievements that I am most proud of are finishing the program twice andthat my results have inspired others. That makes me so proud, because its something that I never thought I could do.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?Since completing the program, the biggest change Ive made is my attitude. I dont approach things with an attitude of doubt. I am always positive and always smiling. If a situation seems unattainable, I think of ways to conquer it. I dont have a defeatist attitude anymore. I dont sit down, cry, and drown myself in ice cream and chicken wings. If someone makes me mad, I work out and take my aggression out on the workout. I also dont feel powerless. I realize that I have more control over life than I would like to admit. Its easy to sit and complain about being overweight, but do nothing about it. Since Beachbody, I realize that I will only be as fat as I allow myself to be. If I dont like being fat, I have the power to change that with help. I truly feel like there is nothing I cant accomplish thanks to FOCUS T25 and Beachbody. I am so grateful for everything.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Checking in daily encouraged me to work out, even when I didnt want to. There were so many nights, being a mom of three, that it would be 10 PM and I still hadntworked out. Normally, I would simply make an excuse, but the challengers and my Coach wouldnt allow it. I often did things out of a sense of loyalty to the other challengers. I never wanted to let anyone down, and I knew that we were all in the struggle together. If I messed up with a food choice, I felt encouraged, not defeated. I was also often given healthy alternatives to the unhealthy food I loved, which made healthy nutrition more appealing to me. When I didnt want to work out, my Challenge Group partners encouraged me to work out. They held me accountable. I also tried to inspire others while in this process, and that made me more motivated, because I had to practice what I was preaching. We became a mini-sisterhood.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach is amazing. She posts motivational quotes, recipes, sayings, pictures, and things that made usjust want to continue to press play. She empowered us, and didnt allow usto make ourselvesfeel helpless. She is very transparent, and allowedusinto her personal journey. She was very vocal about her challenges and struggles, and that helped usto see that this is a difficult journey for everyone. No one is born with a six-pack. She allows usto see her hard work and be inspired by her strength, resilience, and tenacity. She would check in with people when they became quiet. It was never about the commission for Crystal. She truly was invested in everyones journey. She knew our whys, and reminded us of them when we needed to hear them to keep going. She supported us through our struggles, and pushed us to be better with each passing day.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?Shakeology was perfect for me. I often skipped meals, and as a result, my metabolism was so slow. I hated breakfast, because I found healthy breakfast to be so boring. For me, I would love bacon and Belgian waffles every day.If I couldnt have that, I didnt want to eat breakfast. Shakeology allowed me to eat on- the-go, and provided me with energy. It allowed me to not skip breakfast, and I never felt slighted because it was so delicious. I felt as though I was cheating with a chocolate milkshake, and my cravings disappeared. I also did the Ultimate Reset, and I found the entire experience to be life-changing. It helped me to be more aware of food triggers. I had to acknowledge all of the emotional eating that I was doing rather than eating to live. It also made me feel as though I was purging both physically and mentally. When I was done, my mind was clear, I was breathing and sleeping better, and I just felt better overall. I had a renewed appreciation for life.You can change your life, too.

Should Women Take Creatine?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/performance-sports-science/should-women-take-creatine,"Lets put one fear to rest right away: Taking creatine wont give you a barrel chest, saddle you with sleeve-busting arms, or otherwise bestow you with unflattering man muscle. Nothing can (except steroids), and you can thank (or blame) genetics for that. On this point, the research is clear: If youre a woman, supplementing with creatine wont turn you into a linebacker.Otherwise, creatine is an equal-opportunity workout enhancer. Many studies show that ladies can experience the same performance improvements as men  including increases in strength and endurance  without a significant increase in body weight. In one landmark study from Canada, for example, men and women who supplemented with creatine for six weeks both became stronger, but only the guys bulked up. The difference could be due to the fact that men have more muscle to begin with, says Joan Eckerson, Ph.D., a creatine researcher and professor of exercise science at Creighton University, in Nebraska. Theres also evidence that creatine may effect the breakdown of leucine  a key muscle-building amino acid  differently in women than it does in men. But the reality is that scientists havent found concrete explanation for the gender difference, says Eckerson. Indeed, the difference has baffled scientists for decades, since creatine serves the same primary role in the body regardless of whether your chromosomes match or not.Creatine helps create energy. Whenever the body runs low on its primary energy source, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine reacts with other molecules to generate more. As a result, creatine helps the body not only sustain muscular work, but also recover between bouts of it. If you recover faster between sets, you can keep lifting longer and harder, leading to greater gains in strength and power, says Eckerson. This benefit extends post-workout, reducing the time needed between intense lifting sessions. Theres also evidence that it helps endurance athletes recover between repeated bouts of exercise [like intervals], says Eckerson, although its not shown to significantly effect endurance exercise performance.If you do notice greater muscle growth while taking creatine, odds are it wont be significant. In one recent study from Brazil, for example, women in their 60s who took 5 grams of creatine a day during a 12-week strength program gained just 3 percent more muscle than those who took a placebo. What was significant, however, was creatines effect on training volume: By the end of the study, the women who took creatine were able to handle more than double exercise volume (i.e., total sets and reps) of the placebo group. So while creatine cant help you look like a bodybuilder, it might help you lift like one.Which brings us to another misconception: The idea that creatine is a steroid. Its not. Creatine is a protein manufactured by your kidneys, liver, and pancreas, and ingested by way of meat, poultry, and fish. Your body makes about one gram [per day], and you get another gram [per day] from food if youre an omnivore, says Eckerson. Vegetarians and vegans miss out on that second gram, but that doesnt put them at any real disadvantage; if you work out, and you want to boost strength and performance, you should consider increasing your daily dose to more thantwo grams with a supplement like Beachbody Performance Creatine.This is where many women throw up their hands. With so many versions of creatine available to consumers  including creatine nitrate, gluconate, malate, ethyl ester, magnesium chelate, hydrochloride, and alpha ketoglutarate to name a few  deciding between them can easilybecome overwhelming. So allow us to narrow your choices: Dismiss anything thats not labeled creatine monohydrate. Its the most studied (and generally the least expensive) form of creatine, and nothing else has been proven more effective, says Eckerson.You can also dismiss any instructions regarding loading, which is the practice of taking extra-high doses for several days to saturate your muscles. Studies show that even a single daily dose of 5 to 10 grams can do the trick. To optimize your results, take 2 to 5 grams (most scoops are 5 grams) of creatine monohydrate 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and then again within 30 minutes of completing your workout. If this isnt doable, just take the entire 5 to 10 grams post-workout. Anabolic hormones, including insulin and growth hormone, are elevated after exercise, helping to drive more creatine into your cells, says Eckerson, who recommends blending it into a shake or stirring it into juice to make it more palatable. An additional 2 to 5 grams first thing in the morning on rest days will make sure your creatine tank remains topped off.Need another reason to give creatine a try? Taking it may benefit your bones, according to Canadian researchers. In their study, postmenopausal women who added creatine to their training routine for one year lost 69 percent less bone than those who took a placebo. The reason: Creatine may activate bone-synthesizing cells called osteoblasts, say the researchers.As with any supplement, consult your doctor before taking creatine  especially if youre pregnant or have kidney problems. Your body breaks creatine down into a waste product called creatinine, which is processed in your kidneys and excreted in urine, says Eckerson. Thats not a big challenge if your kidneys are healthy, but it can be if they arent."

The Lie Energy Drinks Are Selling You
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/performance-sports-science/can-b-vitamins-really-boost-your-energy,"B-vitamin infused energy drinks are an excellent example of what happens when retail companies dont let science get in the way of making a quick buck (or, in this case, billion). Heres the grain of truth that sparked all of the B-vitamin hype: Many of them  including folate (B9), B6, and B12, which are found in scores of energy drinks  help enzymes within our cells turn nutrients from food into energy we can use. So, naturally, that means that taking a mega-dose of them should translate into more energy, right? Wrong. Your blood stream can only accommodate so much  once youve met the recommended daily value of B vitamins you pee out most of the rest, says Ralph Green, M.D., Ph.D., a distinguished professor emeritus of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis who has researched B vitamins. Sure, some are stored in your body  your liver contains a limited supply of B12, for example. But those stores wont contribute to an immediate surge of energy because theyre not immediately available, says Green. Not that thats even an issue  chances are, you have plenty of Bs in your system already.Recent CDC data shows that only 11 percent of Americans are deficient in B6, only 2 percent are lacking in B12, and just 1 percent are low in folate. The reason: Most people get plenty of all three from their diets. Whole grains are rich in B vitamins, and many products made with refined grains, such as cereals, are fortified with Bs. Plus, theyre present in many fruits and vegetables  bananas and avocados are rich in B6, while spinach and asparagus are packed with folate. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule  people with certain forms of anemia and gastritis are often deficient in B12, and thus may benefit from supplementation. Vegetarians and vegans are also more likely to fall short on B12, which is only found in meat, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs, says Green, adding that such a deficiency can sap your production of red blood cells, causing anemia and general fatigue. Also, if youre on a low calorie diet, you might not be hitting the right numbers for Bs, but thats nothing a good multivitamin cant fix.Most adults 19 to 50 need 1.3 milligrams (mg) of B6 per day, while women and men 51 need 1.5 mg and 1.7 mg, respectively, according to National Institutes of Health dietary guidelines. You need 2.4 micrograms (mcg) of B12 and 400 mcg of folate. (In all three cases, pregnant and lactating women need more.) Its also possible to consume too much of some B vitamins. Regularly consuming more than 100 mg of B6 per day  which is easy to do if you take an energy shot on top of a multi-vitamin  has been linked to nerve damage, for example. NIH guidelines also suggest that consuming excess folate  more than 1,000 mcg per day for adults  can increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer.Research specific to energy drinks hasnt done much to advance the rep of B vitamins as energy boosters, either. Thats because the B vitamins in these products arent tested independently of other potential energizers, such as taurine and choline, not to mention the only proven energizer, caffeine. That makes it hard to figure out exactly what is responsible for any energy boost you might experience. For instance, in a recent study at the University of the Pacific, people who took a caffeinated 5-Hour Energy shot reported a three-hour energy boost, while those taking a decaffeinated version experienced a one-hour spike. Whats not clear is why the decaf version had any effect at all. Was it the taurine, the choline, or something else altogether? Its very possible that its a placebo effect, says study author Sachin Shah, PharmD, an associate professor of pharmacy practice at the University of the Pacific. People might have reported an energy boost because they expected one.If you want to perk up, one of your best bets is still caffeine. Not only does it stimulate your central nervous system, enhancing motivation and energy, but it can also boost strength and reduce your perception of pain, according to a study in The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness. Caffeine has a pretty good track record of increasing performance, especially aerobic or cardiovascular performance, says Mike T. Nelson, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., a fitness trainer and consultant near Minneapolis.Caffeine is particularly effective at boosting performance during morning workouts, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Science in Medicine and Sport. People who consumed caffeine before a morning training session exhibited greater contraction velocity (i.e., explosive power) than they did when they consumed it before an afternoon workout. The reason: Your ability to recruit your largest muscle fibers is depressed in the first few hours after waking, and a central nervous system stimulant (like caffeine) can help jump start your mind-muscle connection, say the researchers.Regardless of when you work out, Nelson recommends consuming up to 200 milligrams of caffeine about a half hour before exercising. A cup of coffee or a serving of Beachbody Performance Energize which contains 100 mg of caffeine and, for the record, no B-vitamins  will do the trick."

Everyday Products are More Toxic Than You Think
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/everyday-products-are-more-toxic-than-you-think,"You probably have some inkling that the chemicals in plastics, pesticides, cleaning solutions, and other everyday products are bad for youbut just how bad are they? Can they really cause tumors, obesity, birth defects, and developmental disorders as many watchdog organizations attest? The fact that these toxins, known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are everywhere is nightmarish enough. But nothing sells papers like a bad dream, so every few years the media picks up on a particularly frightening exampleand mass hysteria ensues.Perhaps you remember the scare surrounding dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), an insecticide banned in 1972 for being harmful not only to bugs, but also nearly every other living thing on the planet. More recently, you might have heard about bisphenol A (BPA)a cancerous compound found in many plastics and can liningsor the controversies surrounding mercury in deep-sea fish and Lord-knows-what in drinking water. Such scares are usually short lived thoughas soon as a politician says something hair-brained or a Kardashian embarrasses herself on video, the EDC nightmare of the moment fades into the background. But it doesnt go away. Indeed, it often gets worse.Testament to this fact is the Endocrine Societys recently released Second Scientific Statement on Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicalsa compendium of EDC horror stories so terrifying that it might cause you not to leave your house, were it not for the fact that your house is every bit as toxic as anything else.Okay, so perhaps I exaggerate. But still, the Endocrine Societys statement pulls no punches. Based on solid science and an impressive collection of clinical and epidemiological research, it points out that we have a serious, poorly-regulated problem on our hands thanks to a critical mass of insecticides, pesticides, plastics, cosmetics, cleaning products, solvents, and endless other chemicals messing with our hormones and potentially causing everything from obesity to cancer.Whats an endocrine-disrupting chemical?Your endocrine system is made up of a series of glands that produce hormones, which are chemical messengers that travel through your body to regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, mood, and sex drive. They do this by attaching to receptors on cells and activating a specific response. Testosterone, estrogen, adrenaline, and insulin are all well-known hormones.EDCs mimic hormones in that they also attach to receptors. Unfortunately, they just block them without delivering the right messages. Since you have a finite amount of receptors, this can be a problem. Think of EDCs as spam that takes up all the space in your physiological email server so that pertinent emails cant get through.Take phthalateschemicals added to plastics, including many toys and some food and beverage containers, to make them more flexible and durable. Since phthalates dont actually bind chemically to plastic, its easy for them to leach into the environment, not to mention your lunch or your childs juice should either of you unwittingly eat or drink from phthalate-laced products. (In case youre wondering, the Beachbody Portion Control Container Kit is phthalate-free, so feel free to give our color-coded system to your kids as building blocks.)While phthalates are useful in assuring little Jimmy doesnt accidentally snap his Maximum Jack action figure in two on Christmas morning, studies have linked them to reduced testosterone. Reduced testosterone, in turn, is associated with a host of issues beyond the, ahem, obvious one, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, according to a study in the journal Diabetes Care. And according to the Endocrine Societys statement, a plethora of examples is emerging for increased disease susceptibility later in life as a function of developmental exposures to EDCs that include BPA, phthalates, PCBs, pesticides, dioxins, and tributyltin (TBT), among others.If youre still focusing on that obesity thing, the Endocrine Societys report devotes some major real estate to the EDC/obesity link, going so far as to propose a whole subclass of obesogens, or EDCs that may be specifically linked to severe weight gain. So plastic can make you fat. Go figure.What can you do?The Endocrine Societys statement strongly recommends that EDCs and their impact be heavily researched, but given that the government is fairly lax in regulating these chemicals, exposure is a fact of modern life.With this in mind, your best bet is to take control of the situation by educating yourself about EDCs and learning how to minimize your exposure. The Endocrine Societys 150-page statement may be a lot to chew on, so you can start with more easily digestible information such as the Hormone Health Networks Scientific Statement on Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals.Once youre all knowledged-up, youll probably want to actively avoid EDCs. Reducing your exposure is particularly important if youre pregnant or have young children, whose developing bodies are especially susceptible. Eating fresh (preferably organic) produce and reducing your animal product intake are both smart ideas. (Note: Im not suggesting you stop eating meatjust dial it back a little.) There are also cleanses and detoxes that claim to help clear toxins from your system, such as Beachbodys Ultimate Reset. Are these products effective? Honestly, you cant completely purge a lifetime of chemicals in a few weeks. Whats more, youll just reintroduce them to your system if you resume old habits. But dont get me wrong, Im a strong advocate of these programs. Learning a few holistic practices, including how to restructure your diet to be healthier, is a great way to start removing EDCs from your life, especially if youre new to clean eating. Avoiding EDCs can be a major lifestyle overhaul, but diet is the foundation.According to the New York Times, only a fraction of the more than 80,000 chemicals in existence todayEDCs or otherwisehave been tested for safety. Theres no way to live completely off the EDC grid, so theres no point in stressing out. But it doesnt hurt to learn as much as you can, and do what you can to limit them in your life."

Single Mom Lost 100 Pounds in 9 Months and Won $1000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/heather-lost-100-pounds-in-9-months-and-won-1000,"Heather O, age 31 from Auburn, MA, lost 100 lbs in nine months with 21 Day Fix, INSANITY MAX:30, and 21 Day Fix EXTREME. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Heather is an Independent Beachbody Coach.Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?When I started this program I was so lost. I felt so miserable about they way I felt, and who I was as a person. I was having severe anxiety attacks that were life stopping. I was afraid to do anything for fear of everything in my life falling apart. I am a single mother to a beautiful little boy, but that in itself made life hard. While pregnant my ex would yell at me, and tell me how he couldnt believe someone so disgusting was carrying his child. I finally left this abusive relationship, but those words made me feel like I was worthless. I was so over weight, I was a smoker, and I was completely unhealthy. I didnt do anything, I went to work, and came home and ate. I did this in bed while I nursed my infant son. I was so miserable I would lie awake at night and just cry, because this is not how life was suppose to be. I was destined for bigger things than this, and I was just letting my life pass me by, and even worse the life of my child.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I would go on Facebook while I was pumping milk at work. I saw this woman I knew Dana and her journey. We both had been on the same synchronized swimming team growing up, and our stories were so much a like. We were both single mothers, and we had grown up together. I saw how happy she was, and I was so desperate for a change, that I reached out to her, and asked what she was doing. She told me all about Beachbody, and what it had done for her. Being that I was so broke, and I felt like I wasnt good enough to be part of Beachbody, I put it off for 5 months. I saw her over and over again having the time of her life, and I thought thatll never be me. Then one day it clicked, I could be a Coach, I could help other people. I signed up for the 21 Day Fix on November 11, 2014, and I havent looked back.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The biggest challenge before I started Beachbody was my self esteem. I have always had such a low self esteem, and I have abused my body in every way. When I was growing up I was severely anorexic, and that lasted till college. I never thought I was good enough, or skinny enough. Then when I went off to college I became addicted to drugs trying to stay skinny and be perfect. My whole life fell apart, and the little esteem I had left was gone. Then I was in an abusive relationship that I thought I deserved, because I was such a bad person, and I allowed him to make me feel like I was less of a person. Since becoming part of team Beachbody, my esteem is the highest it has ever been in my life. I wake up everyday with a purpose, and the feeling of pride I have when I look at myself, is something I have never had in my entire life. I am now able to spread the good news of Beachbody, and help others who feel the same way I did. I no longer feel like I cant do anything, I now feel empowered.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I was so out of shape when I started 21 Day Fix, and I was intimidated by the workouts. Then I realized that there were modifiers and it made me feel empowered when I would finish one of the workouts. Then after awhile I could do it without using the modifiers, and that felt even better. I was drawn to being able to drink the shakes in the morning, while getting Declan ready for the day, and myself ready for work. I liked that I could eat normal food, that it was a diet it was a life style change. I could handle a life style change its diets that I could never do. I would say I was going to diet but then I would feel deprived and give up. I have done the 21 Day Fix, INSANITY MAX:30, and the 21 Day Fix EXTREME and they were all easy to follow meal plans.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?My first round of the 21 Day Fix I lost 19 pounds in 21 days, then I did another round and lost an additional 6 pounds making a grand total of 25 pounds in a month in a half. Then I went on to do INSANITY MAX:30 and I started to see muscle definition, and that was something I hadnt seen in ten years. I lost 65 pounds doing two rounds of INSANITY MAX:30, and the muscles that I have are amazing. Then I wanted to get shredded so I did 21 Day Fix EXTREME and lost the last ten pounds to hit 100 pounds lost. I loved all the programs for what they did for my body. The achievement I am the most proud of is that I am able to run again. I loved running growing up, but being a smoker and over weight, well, that was just not happening. I quit smoking, and lost a 100 pounds. In June I ran a 10 mile road race pushing my son, and I ran the whole thing without stopping. Now I am training for a half marathon. Its all thanks to the programs and what they have done for my body.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I dont even know where to begin with how my life has changed. I could just cry right now thinking about the person that I was. I was the girl that allowed her boyfriend to put out lit cigarettes on her while she was pregnant because she just didnt have it in her to fight back. I had lost all of my drive and fight. I was solely surviving in life, and I would look at old people and be envious that they were on their way out because I didnt know if I could hold on anymore it was so hard to get up every day. Then I started Beachbody, and my life had done a 180. I am in a beautiful relationship with someone who adores me, and my son. I am big into my church, and I am so happy with life I am able to spread that happiness to everyone I meet. I wake up every morning with passion and drive. I want to live every moment, and I want to be the person that people look at and say because of you I didnt give up. My life has meaning now, and for that there is not enough thank yous in the world.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?When I first started the 21 Day Fix, I was hopeless. I had no idea what I was doing, or even how to beginning. I was placed into a Challenge Group that my Coach Dana ran, and the women in the Challenge Group were so motivating it helped me feel like I could do it. I always flourished when I was in a team setting, thats why I always did team sports growing up. The Challenge Group was like being part of a team again. It filled a void in me that had been left open for so long. I was able to succeed because of this team atmosphere and the accountability a Challenge Group provides. After 3 months of being in Danas Challenge Groups, I started my own Challenge Groups, and have been ever since. It helps me stay accountable, by being the person others are accountable to.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My team Beachbody Coach is also my upline, and we have so much in common. When I was starting my journey, I was so nervous but Dana always had faith in me. She believed in me, and always was willing to help me grow. The day after I signed up for 21 Day Fix, I sat on the phone with Dana, and we discussed my hopes and dreams for hours. She opened something inside of me that was long dead, for so long I was almost afraid to hope and dream because I was holding on by a string in life. Growing up I was always setting these high goals, and dreams. Then life has a way of knocking you down, and you stop dreaming. Dana made me feel like it was okay to dream for a better life, for my son and I.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Before my journey with Beachbody I had horrible insomnia, it was driving me insane. I would have panic attacks thinking about having to go to bed at night, because I would lay there and not be able to sleep. Then I would try to stay awake by drinking mass amounts of energy drinks. I had no energy, and I was almost going insane from the lack of sleep. It was so horrible, I cant even express how horrible this all was. I was trapped in this hell of unhealthy eating, and sleeplessness. After starting 21 Day Fix, and Shakeology I stopped drinking energy drinks, and had natural energy. I now have enough natural energy to get up at 5am to workout, then go to work, and when I get home run 3 miles. I do this all on top of being a single mother to an almost two year old. I was able to regulate my sleeping patterns, and I starting being able to feel normal.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?Before I stared the 21 Day Fix, I had horrible stomach ulcers, and irritable bowl syndrome. I have had this my whole life. I was first diagnosed with ulcers when I was 12 years old, and I have had 7 endoscopies, and 5 colonoscopies because of these problems. I am only 31 and I have had so many doctors appointment, surgeries, and pain that I should be 80. I have no gallblatter because of my stomach issues, and I was afraid to go anywhere if there wasnt a bathroom close by. Since starting 21 Day Fix and Shakeology my stomach feels the best it has ever felt. I am off all ulcer medication, anti acids, and irritable bowl syndrome medications. I can go hiking, or go out boating without fear of having to use the restroom. I can eat like a normal person, and not have to carry medication with me all the time.Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)Before I started my journey with the 21 Day Fix my blood pressure was so high. They couldnt do anything to keep my pressure down, or even regulate it. It got so bad , that they had to take my son a month early, because I was so unhealthy. My blood pressure had me at such a risk of seizures, that they had to do an emergency c-section to get him out. I had to have padding on my hospital bed because they were just waiting for me to seize out because my pressure was going over 200, and they couldnt get it down. Even after he was born I was placed on high blood pressure medication, and it still did nothing for me. I had to go to the doctors every week to be monitored, and they just were trying to keep me stable. Since starting 21 Day Fix and drinking Shakeology I didnt even realize it at first but the sweating and heaviness I use to feel was going away. Then they took my pressure and it was perfect. Thats right perfect. I am perfecting medication free now!You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Supportive Challenge Group Helped Brittany Stick with Program and Lose 75 Pounds
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/supportive-challenge-group-helped-brittany-stick-with-program-and-lose-75-pounds,"Brittany S, age 22 from Renton, WA, lost 75 lbs with Ultimate Reset, 21 Day Fix, and 21 Day Fix EXTREME. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Before I started my journey I was miserable, thats the simplest way to put it. I was only 21 years old and obese. I had always had curves, but after I lost my thyroid at 19 I started gaining weight, and over the next 2 1/2 years I put on 100 pounds. I had to have my gall bladder removed because my weight yo-yod so much. I suffered from sever depression and anxiety to the point of attempting suicide. Chronic migraines (like 3-4 a week). I was on countless medications and then medications to cancel side effects from the other medications. I couldnt talk to people because I had such bad social anxiety. All of this at the age of 21. I used to be a very outgoing teenager and had a beautiful figure but my life completely crashed. I was so overweight that my husband and I couldnt start a family. I got pregnant once and miscarried which only worsened everything else. I used to cry when buying clothes because I didnt want to look in the mirror. My life was just a downward spiral, and it was slowly killing me.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?What really hit home was when my husband snapped a picture of me and I went back and looked at it and I didnt even recognize myself. I honestly thought it was someone else. I kept thinking there is no way I have gotten that big. I knew I was sick and needed to make a change, doctors kept telling me that if I wanted to start a family I needed to get things in order. I had already suffered one miscarriage and that was going to keep happening if I didnt changeWhat is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My biggest challenge was finding the motivation. I had done so many programs in the past. I had pretty much been dieting since I was 14. But I had started and quit them all. I had never been able to stick to one for longer than 3 weeks. But having the Challenge Groups and my Coach to push me was amazing. It kept me going. I also flooded my Facebook feed with positive influences. People who were on this journey with me or people who had already reached there goal. I would listen to them tell their story, and that pushed me. I wanted to have that after picture. One like they had. I had people that pushed me on the days when I didnt want to work out. I had my mom who was the person who signed me up. She would call me and ask if I had done my workout yet or if I had drank my Shakeology. It was that constant reminder and motivation that kept me going.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I started with the 21 Day Fix and Shakeology. My favorite part was the meal plan. I hated counting calories and the containers made it so easy for me. I am a visual person so seeing my food and the amount I should eat was wonderful! I loved that the workouts were only 30 minutes and that if I needed to modify something there was that option. The energy that autumn exuded helped with my depression because with that type of energy there was no way my energy couldnt match hers.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?My first round I lost 12 pounds and I cant even remember how many inches. And each round I did after that was fueled by my results from the following round. I started to see a change in myself and other people could see it too. Ive lost 75 pounds and 8 pant sizes! I tallied up the inches I lost and if I remember that number right it was 50+ total inches. I have never had something work like this for me. Although my physical change has been astounding, the change Im most proud of is the one that took place inside. The one that not everyone can see.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?Im no longer on medications; I only have to take one! and thats to help my non existent thyroid. I dont deal with suicidal thoughts anymore. I dont have to stay in bed because my depression makes it so I cant get out. Yes I still have some bad days, but those days are so few and far between. Im not in the hospital every other week with debilitating migraines being pumped full of narcotics. I can actually talk to people now and dont have social anxiety. I no longer have to take anxiety medications to feel numb. I feel comfortable in my own skin and have started to love myself again. I look forward to shopping because I know I will be able to fit into clothes. I can actually find hobbies I like to do because Im fit enough to try things. I can finally start trying to have a family because my body can with stand it. But most of all, I can be an inspiration to others who are dealing with the same things that I used to go through. I can show people they can change there life!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Seeing everyone around me reach for their goals and struggle with some of the same things I struggled with was just inspiring. And made me realize I wasnt the only person out there. That there are people who deal with the same things. And it helped me realize that it was okay for me to ask for help.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My mom is my Coach so I had a little bit of an edge, but we supported each other. In the mornings we would call each other and work out together over Facetime. and not let each other quit. We would remind each other that we had to drink our Shakeology. Having someone other than myself to focus on pushed me to become better, because I wanted to keep up with her.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?During the times when I started to plateau the Ultimate Reset and the 3-Day Refresh helped me to kick it up a notch and give me that extra boost I needed to keep from giving up. I honestly believe Shakeology is what helped rid me of my migraines, granted it was probably because I was improving my overall lifestyle, but I started to feel so much better after I had been drinking it for several weeks. Shakeology helped give me the energy in the morning that I needed so that by the end of the day I was actually tired. Helping me deal with my insomnia. And because of all that I had a better outlook on life. I was able to focus on things because I wasnt tired and wasnt feeling the grips of depression. Because I no longer had a gall bladder my stomach was all messed up and it helped to keep things moving and it was one thing I could count on not upsetting my stomach.You can change your life, too.

Single Mom Lost 68 Pound, Now a Bikini Competitor!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/single-mom-lost-68-lbs-now-bikini-competitor,"See the inspirational story of Kailin Turner, a military vet and single mom who overcame significant challenges in her personal life to achieve an extraordinary, award-winning fitness transformation.She lost 68 pounds with a variety of Beachbody programs, andyour votes helped her win$6,500 in theBeachbody Challenge!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I almost didnt realize what I looked like. I was a large girl with a skinny mind. Growing up I had never been really small (at the height of 57 by late middle school) but I was never big either. I enlisted into the military where I got down to my smallest, at a size 8, but after training I ballooned up to a size 18 jean in a little under 2 years. I was going through fertility issues and was depressed, not focused on my health and fitness, and soon found myself so uncomfortable in my own skin.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?The first inspiration was to not move up to a size 20 jean. I was bursting out of my size 18 and just couldnt take it anymore. I wanted to ultimately surprise my family by losing the weight and so that kept me going. I just wanted to feel good about myself again. A big motivator was also that I wanted to have a child and start a family and weight was holding me back.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Divorce. Right in the middle of P90X/INSANITY hybrid I got an email from my deployed husband saying he wanted a divorce and nothing would change his mind. I was so shocked. Most people would have grabbed a tub of ice cream and given up on their workouts But even the day I found out, I worked out. Somehow I kept going and I actually finished. That round I ended up losing 50 pounds in 90 days; with a divorce and a cross state move, I did pretty well! After that I became pregnant within the next year, and had such a tough pregnancy that it landed me in the hospital on bed rest where I lost any muscle I gained with P90X. I was caring for a preemie and was weak from the stay. I actually took two years off. Now I am a single mother to a little girl and while its tough, I make my way through my workout each day so I can feel amazing inside and out.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?With P90X, it was that it worked quick. I lost a substantial amount of weight each week just by doing my workout everyday and drinking my Shakeology. With INSANITY it was the fact that I mentally had to gain some strength and dig as deep as I could within me to finish. With FOCUS T25, it was the fact that I was a single working mom and I needed something quick but really effective. With Body Beast it was the simple fact I didnt have to do a lot of cardio and I got shredded. With 21 Day Fix EXTREME it was that it really taught me how to eat the cleanest I could possibly ever eat, and I leaned out quickly by really dialing in my nutrition.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I went from a size 18 to a size 2 all by working out with Beachbody Programs. I am proud to say that I could get these results at home in a short amount of time each day. I am proud that I stuck with it, no matter how long it took me, I stuck with it, I trusted the process and it worked. I went from feeling awful about myself to being confident and proud. Not all women can truly say they love their bodies. But I can definitely say that now. I am proud to have signed up for my first bikini competition; no matter where I place, I will be very proud.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I went from super unhealthy to healthy. I have gone from following people to leading and inspiring people. The biggest difference my life has faced is really helping other women feel confident about who they are, give them advice, and share the knowledge I have to help them achieve their fitness goals. I am also a happier mother. I have time with my little girl because I work out at home, yet I still have that me time to focus on what I want in life as well. How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?She did the 21 Day Fix EXTREME with me. We both have ups and downs or times we really wanted some sweets. We would just message each other and keep each other in check and let each other know we only have a couple days left!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Oh! Shakeology is a must for me every single day. Its my breakfast meal replacement and I wouldnt go a day without it. I know that it has helped me create the results I now have. It kept me full and kept me away from craving sweets (I used to crave candy badly!). On days I felt like I was too busy to cook dinner I would also have Shakeology for dinner with something like fruit or a complex carb. It was super convenient for this busy mom!You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/true-change-from-inside-out,"Randi Hernandez, age 53 from Seward, NE, lost 150 pounds in 10 months with the21 Day Fix and Shakeology.Your votes helped her win over $100,000 in the Beachbody Challenge contest and the title of Grand Prize Champion 2015!$100,000 Grand Prize Champion Randi Hernandes (left) with her sister/ CoachRita Shultz (right), who won $20,000 for helping Randi reclaim her health.Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I have been obese almost all my life. I was in an abusive marriage for 15 years, where daily I was told how fat and ugly I was. I felt hopeless. So I would make myself feel better by eating. My food was my friendit would never judge me. My weight kept going up and I kept going down. Down so far, I hated myself. My marriage ended. But my addiction to food did not. Years later, I married again, and found out I was pregnant. 5 months pregnant! I was shocked, and in disbelief. But great news, I could eat for 2 now! After all, I was pregnant. As the years went by, I kept getting heavier and the feelings of self hate kept building. My daughter was now being affected. When there was a school function or activity to attend, I would have to sit in the back of the room where no one would see me. My daughter would not even acknowledge me. No eye contact or even a glance my way for a smile. Now that, that cut me to my core. But it still did not wake me up to my obesity, and my unhealthy life style.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I was to the point where I struggled to move. Driving my car was really bad. To reach the pedals I had to move my seat up. My stomach would push into the steering wheel so I could barely steer the car. Scary! I couldnt bend down to tie my shoes. I got winded just walking through a store. I was ashamed. Theres not enough space to write all the activities, and daily tasks, I couldnt do because of my weight. My sisters bugged me for years to do Beachbody workouts. I told them I get all the exercise I needed at my maintenance job. I was lying to myself and them, and we all knew it. I kept believing that lie until one day I really saw myself in a mirror. I couldnt stop looking at the person looking back at me. I broke down and cried out loud; What have you done to yourself! Why! I screamed at myself. I looked over at my daughters picture- it was like she could see me. I felt so disgusted, and so ashamed that I could barely breathe. I weighed almost 300lbs at 52! I started my Beachbody program at age 52.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The biggest challenge I faced was my attitude. I had failed so many times before, and this exercise program was no different. All I could say to myself was negative things, things I have said over and over hundreds of times in my head. This had molded me into the person I had become. It was so much easier to believe negative things. I did this for so long. I thought changing would be impossible. I told myself its not going to work and Ill prove it. I told my sister I would try the program, just to get her off my back. I had no intention of actually doing it because I already knew it would not work. Little did I know! My sister (Coach) kept asking me if I had received my 21 Day Fix and Shakeology. Well I had, and she said we were starting at 5:30AM Monday. I said no, she said yes. She said Well, Im going to call you so answer your phone! Monday came, and my phone rang at 5:30AM. I thought, if she believes in me that much I guess Ill give it a try. That first workout made me a believer. I could do it!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I chose the Beachbody workout program my Coach recommended, which was the 21 Day Fix and Shakeology. What a perfect fit for me! I love it so much, Ive been doing it for 10 months now and counting. I love the portion cups, and nutrition guide, it is easy to follow. The workouts are actually fun and I enjoy them. Autumns pep talks during the workouts are inspiring. She says to Take the word cant out of your vocabulary! So I did. Now I know I can! It is not impossible. I learned how to eat right and that the right foods are used to give my body fuel. I felt full and, most of the time, I did not even eat all the food that I could have on the program. Autumn taught me it was not about eating less, it is about eating right. And it is not about being skinny, it is about being healthy.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Since starting the 21 Day Fix I have lost 150lbs. I have lost 100 inches overall. I am proud of not quitting. This time I am not a failure. I have gained a feeling of self worth, and self respectlike I matter! I finally matter! I can walk with my head held high, and Im not afraid of how others look at me. I actually love how people look at me now. Although, I have to say, it is a change to hear how great I look- Im still getting used to that! Beachbody has made my hopes and dreams into a reality. Im healthy, happy, and so blessed. My daughter can look at me now and see that I am strong and confident, and this time I succeeded. I am the most proud of being this kind of example for my daughter.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?The changes in my life have been amazing. I never thought any of this was possible. My whole way of life has changed. The way I see myself now its like I stepped out of this huge confinement, only it was my huge body. I feel my mind is clear, and not trapped with self hate and negative thoughts. I feel strong and confident. Most of all, my daughter is proud of me. She looks at me differently now, and does not hesitate to give me words of support. She even acknowledged me at a school function by saying Thats my mom; doesnt she look great? This is why Beachbody is so dear to me. Beachbody gave me my life back. A true change from the inside out. My food addiction is gone! It has been replaced with my love of being healthy, and exercise. And my newest love Me!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?The Challenge Group I was a part of was a fun Group. One of my keys to success was being part of this Group. When I thought I could not go on, someone in the Group would remind me that it is hard work, but worth working hard for. It is also a way to stay connected with others while on my fitness journey. Ive made a lot of new fitness friends. I know I will continue to be in a Group because I feel I can return the favor by being an inspiration to others.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach Rita, would call me daily. Coach Rita is so busy, but she was never too busy to give me daily encouragement with a phone call or text. She would also ask me about food intake, and if I was following the nutrition guide and using the containers that came with the 21 Day Fix. She would also give me tips, and share recipes to try with Shakeology. When I lost my first 20lbs, I didnt know if I was more excited or if she was! Ritas support was extremely valuable to my success. I couldnt have done it without her. I want to someday soon be an inspiration to others, as she has been to me.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?I cant say enough wonderful things about Shakeology. I will always use this product. I love it! It definitely helps me with my cravings, and it gives me energy! My digestive system is regular now. I have an overall healthy feeling about my body. Thank you for creating this super, wonderful, nutrition packed shake! I never in my life would have thought that drinking a shake everyday would make me this healthy!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?Before I started with my Beachbody program, and Shakeology, I took medicine for my stomach. I also took blood pressure medicine. I had very bad acid reflux, so I took medicine for that too. I was a mess! My Dr. had been warning me for years to make a change, and to lose weight. But I did not listen to him. My addiction to food was too strong to take his advice. He said if I kept going down the path I was on, I probably wouldnt live long. Recently, I went in for a check up and my Dr. almost did not recognize me. He was amazed at my weight loss, success, and overall great health. He asked me how I was doing it. I told him I had been doing a Beachbody workout called 21 Day Fix and drinking Shakeology. He had heard of it, and advised me not to change a thing! And to continue drinking Shakeology because the health benefits were obvious.Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)With doing Beachbody workouts, and drinking Shakeology daily, I no longer take blood pressure pills, stomach pills, or acid reflux medicine! My husband says I dont snore any more. I can safely drive my car! I thought I was too old at 52 to start a healthy way of living, and lose weight. That is just not true. Ill be honest, the hardest part was starting. I think about it now, and the only regret I have is not starting sooner! Now I love the way I feel. I love the way I look. I love the way my daughter sees me. I love the way my husband whistles at me. But most of allI love Me. Thank you Beachbody!You can change your life, too.

Ask the Expert: When Should I Listen to My Cravings?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/ask-expert-listen-cravings,"Cravings can be intenseand often they go way beyond minor hankering. Surely, it cant just be that you want chocolate. There must be some reason that youneedchocolate. Come on, please! Just a taste.Unfortunately, you probably dont. In most cases, cravings arent a physiological function telling you what you need. In fact, its much more likely that theyre adysfunction.You might be aware of an infographic floating around the Interwebs featuring foods that people typically crave, along with micronutrients that (supposedly) trigger those cravings. If you desire bread, toast, or pasta, the graphic suggests you need more nitrogen in your diet. Salty foods mean you need chloride, chocolate suggests a need for magnesium, etc. You may notice a complete lack of references at the bottom of this chart. Thats probably because theres no science backing up these claimswhatsoever. While the craving might stem from something more obvioussugar, for exampleits highly unlikely that your yen for chocolate means you need more magnesium in your diet.Why Do I Crave Chocolate and Other Foods That Arent Good For Me?Cravings are far more complex than this cause-and-effect chart suggests. While a subtle nutrient need may be partly to blame, cravings arise for several reasonsand tend to include a tangled web of psychology, hormones, and other physiological issues.Lets go back to the chocolate/magnesium connection. By the time chocolate gets to the milked-down form most Americans consume, theres not much magnesium left. One ounce of milk chocolate contains just 4% of the recommended daily value for magnesium. Dark chocolate has 16%.Why would the body seek out a food for a specific nutrient when that food has very little of that nutrient? Wouldnt it make more sense that your body would crave foods richer in magnesium, such as nuts, leafy greens, or beans? Your chocolate cravings probably exist for more insidious reasons. Some research shows similarities between chocolate cravings and alcohol addiction, in thatboth alcohol and cacao contain similar neuroactive alkaloids(chemicals that tweak your melon). In other words, research suggests that chocolate is addictive.Another reason you could be craving that brownie is because of your emotional history with it. Its one of the great American comfort foods. Were brought up identifying chocolate with birthdays, Halloween, post-soccer game ice cream outings, and all those magic moments when you were a good little boy or girl who deserved a reward. If you cant see how that would etch a positive association neural pathway deep into your gray matter, we need to get Dr. Freud on the horn, stat.Furthermore, unless you like chewing on cacao nibs (and some people do!), the chocolate you consume is filled with sugarand sugar cranks up the feel good hormone serotonin (among other chemicals) levels in your brain, giving you a feeling of mild euphoria.When its gone, you want more. Combine this sugar hit with the emotional issues and youve got one powerful craving.Im not ruling out the possibility of a causal relationship between cravings and micronutrientsbut the key word here ispossibility. For instance, when I first began road cycling seriously, I found myself with an irresistible craving for potato chips. It was only when I started adding sea salt to my recovery drink that those cravings passed. Similarly, pregnant women often crave foods that are high in nutrients they need. For example, she might crave cheeseburgersan obvious source of calcium and iron.If youre convinced that your particular craving stems from a micronutrient deficiency, theres an easy way to test this: supplement the vitamin or mineral you have in mind. Getting back to chocolate, if you buy into the magnesium thing, try supplementing. Another angle would be to embrace the psychology aspect of cravings and instead grab a bag of Chocolate Shakeology, so that you can indulge yourself, but in a healthy way. (Not to beat a dead horse, but a serving of Shakeology contains 20% of the recommended daily value of magnesium.)So I Shouldnt Trust My Cravings?Maybe sometimes. With all this talk of micronutrients, weve overlooked another possible root cause for your cravingamacronutrient deficiency. You could be craving certain foodsor certain food typesbecause your balance of carbs, protein, and fat is off. While its a stretch to assume your body desires a food because it contains trace amounts of a certain mineral, the causal link between foods and macronutrients (carbs, protein, and fat) is obvious. Eat a piece of carb-heavy cake and youre going to spike your blood sugar.If you think this may be the case, feed the craving with healthy food. If youre craving sweet things, increase your fruit and veggie intake. If you crave greasy foods, increase your raw nut or avocado (good fats) intake. If you find yourself craving meat and cheese, increase your lean protein intake with chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes. If you do this and it doesnt work, odds are that your cravings are more psychologically based.If youre deliberately eating at a calorie deficit, this method can be a problem. Ultimately, youre not getting enough of any macronutrient. In these situations, it might be useful to adjust the balance of carbs/protein/fat in your diet. So, for example, if youre in the middle of phase one of P90X and youre jonesin for sweet stuff, try switching to phase two, which features a carb increase.Cravings suck. And when youre trying to lose weight, they suck even more, ascalorie deficits tend to increase cravings. In our most frustrated, give-me-the-donut-before-I-kill-someone moments, wed all like a simple solution. Unfortunately, it doesnt exist. Finding your way around cravings requires a little patience and experimentation. Its just a matter of finding a healthy substitute, a little willpoweror some combination thereof.What foods do you crave?"

How did you feel about yourself and your body?Before I started with Beachbody, my life looked like a fairy tale from the outside looking in. But on the inside, I was a mess  I was dealing with postpartum depression on top of the anxiety I had. I hated my body, and I never thought I was worth the time or money. My lack of confidence flowed into every area of my life  I never wanted to go anywhere and I would make excuses as to why I could not go, I never bought myself anything new because I felt like it would never look good on me anyways, I was uncomfortable even in front of my own husband which caused issues in our marriage. I felt like I was trapped in a fat suit, my reflection wasnt who I was on the inside.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My inspiration, the heart beat behind my transformation is my daughters. I wondered how I could teach them to have confidence and love themselves, if I didnt love my self. I wanted to raise these confident, happy, fierce girls and I knew that action would speak louder than words and I had to show them how to be all those things! My biggest fear is that they would grow up and be like me (well the old me)  depressed, anxious, no confidence, unhealthy. Secondly, it was important for me to work on my marriage. I knew a lot of the underlying issues where my issues. I didnt think I was worthy of being loved, I was closed off, and it was a huge block in my life.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?I had a lot of excuses. My husband and I work opposite shifts, my girls are young and require a lot of attention, I felt like I had to much to lose and that it was helpless.

Shakeology helped fight my carb and sweet cravings so I could skip the night time cereal or ice cream because I knew in the morning I was going to get my sweet fix with the shakes. The shakes fueled my body and I could feel a distinct difference between my cravings, energy level, and mood.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I chose T25 primarily because of the 25 min workouts. My husband works long hours and his schedule is busy. I needed something I knew I could fit into my daily life. I knew if I chose a program that took too much time then I would never stick to it. After completing T25, I started The 21 Day Fix, mainly because I knew I needed to work on the nutrition aspect of my transformation. I thought that after T25, the 21 Day Fix workouts would be easy  man was I wrong! The workouts were intense, the nutrition was amazing and I think I will continue using the meal plan with every program I do because it is simple and works!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Prior to Beachbody, I would lose weight, then it would stall then I would get frustrated and stop and gain it all back. So when I lost 30 lbs in 60 days and then kept losing it  I was floored! To date, I have lost 75 pounds  that is more weight than the weight of both my kids! I think what I am most proud of is my confidence level, I am wearing a bikini! I am looking people in the eyes again, I can hold my head high and I am the example I wanted to be for my girls. I am proud that I can run with my girls, lift them up, throw them in the air, take them places, and just show them how wonderful life is. When I see my transformation photos, I can not even believe it myself!

I have the energy to be the mom I wanted to be. I have the strength and confidence to teach my girls how to be strong, powerful women. My marriage has improved because of my increased confidence and improved mood. I am proud of my successes with my body and I am not hesitant to go out anymore. I realized that investing a little bit of time into myself, I am a better wife, mom and person. I am so proud that I have used my platform to change the lives so many! I am chasing my daughter on her bike while pushing a stroller up a hill, I am no longer making excuses to hang out at the pool, and my daughters lives have changed as well. My 5 year old exercises with me, she asks me about healthy choices, they arent drinking juice, we traded chicken nuggets for grilled chicken and white pasta for whole wheat!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?The Challenge Group helped me tremendously. When I didnt know what to eat, when I didnt feel like pushing play I knew I had peer support and the support of my coach to get me through when I wasnt strong. The group was fun and supportive. I love the recipes my coach would post, the fun assignments (most sweaty selfies and meal photos) and the inspiring quotes.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My coach was there for me every step of the way. Shakeology recipes, clean eating tips, workout tips, answering questions for me. I could not have done this without her. My coach was there for me in the group and outside the group.

I was able skip my night time snacking, which was huge for me. Prior to Shakeology, I had a bowl of cereal or ice cream every night. I never thought I would be able to give that up, but I did without a single issue. I noticed a change in my mood and was finally experiencing more regularity.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?I have hypothyroidism and I thought losing weight was going to be almost impossible for me.

My dose of Synthroid was always changing, but my dose has been stable than ever!oYou can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Autumn Calabrese’s Tips on How to Stop Making Excuses
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/autumn-calabreses-tips-on-how-to-stop-making-excuses,"Autumns a petite Italian mom from Cleveland, but dont underestimate the trainer behind the 21 Day Fix. This single mom with more than 10 years of personal training under her belt has gotten countless clients where they want to gowhether that meant losing ten pounds, a hundred pounds, or getting their body back after becoming a mom.Shes in amazing shape now, but as a teenager, she struggled with her weight and still battles cravings, a tight schedule, and mornings when she just doesnt feel like working out. Get ready to be inspired by the story of our newest trainer and find out how to stop making excuses and start seeing results.Ok, lets cut right to the chase. Have you always looked like a model?No. When I was a teenager, I was that girl with frizzy hair and braces who got picked on all the timeI dont want people to look at me and think, oh you dont know, its so easy for you. Because there was a time when it wasnt.When did that change?I started dancing when I was in eighth grade. At first, it was one or two classes a week, but the next year my teacher wanted me competing, which meant I had to take a certain number of classes a week; the more classes I took, the more I wanted to take. Our teacher would talk to us about healthy eating and not drinking soda and that sort of thing so that we could give our best performances. I remember I cut soda out and three weeks after I did it, I walked into dance class one day and everyone stopped and was like, what the heck? They noticed it overnight. I lost five or six pounds, which on my frame, is a lot! But, they would never talk about you should be this skinny or say youre too fat. I think that made a huge impact on how I work with people. My big philosophy is learning how to eat clean and enjoying everything in moderation.How do your experiences as a teenager influence your training style?Im not the trainer that is going to scream at somebody and be like, do it, do it, do it. Im never going to put someone down. Im always going to be the cheerleader for you and encourage you to reach your goals. Ive been there. I was the underdog.How did you get into personal training?I came to Los Angeles wanting to act and dance. But, I have a bulging disc in my lower spine so I still couldnt dance as much as I wanted to. I could book a commercial, but I could never book a tour. I could never be on Broadway because my back couldnt handle that. I pursued acting and have my SAG card and did a commercial here and there, but I was waiting tables the whole time. I waited tables from the time I was 16 to the time I was 25, and was burnt out. I needed to figure out something else to do. I didnt want to sit at a desk, but I didnt want to teach dance either. I didnt want to get burnt out on it. I looked into personal training certifications, got certified through the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), and started training. Then a couple years later, I became pre- and post-natal certified.Speaking of which, youre a mom. Was it hard for you to lose the baby weight after having your son?There was a point when I hit a plateau and I was like, OK, this is a bummer, but I stopped making it about the weight and made it about challenging myself in other ways. Could I lift just a little bit heavier? If I was out for a run, could I run a little bit further or a little bit faster? Could I put the baby in the stroller and push him because thats going to give me more resistance? The weight ended up coming off and I ended up five pounds lighter than before I got pregnant.Did you try and stay fit when you were pregnant?I worked out throughout my entire pregnancy. I was in the gym in the morning and went into labor that night. I still gained 36 pounds during my pregnancy and I had a C-section. My goal was to get the baby weight off in 12 weeks, but first I had to recover from the C-section, so it wasnt like I could go back to working out the day I got home. But, the one thing I could do was go back to my healthy eating. I was breast-feeding so I made sure I was eating enough for myself and for him, but I made healthy choices. When I could get back to working out, I did.Wasnt that hard? How did you make the time?This is the one time youll see the tougher side of me. I dont have patience for excuses. Ive had a C-section, Ive had a hernia, and I have a bulging disc in my lower back. For the last 10 years, Ive worked 12-hour days. And it wasnt like I only worked out with my clients. I had to find time in between being a single mom. And I still do it. And you can too. You can either make excuses, or you can make results. How bad do you want it? What are you really willing to sacrifice? Yes, there are sacrifices. Yes, there are mornings I dont want to go to the gym. There are times Id rather eat chocolate cake than broccoli. But, at the end of the day, I love feeling good about myself. I love having energy to keep up with my son. I love when I put on my jeans and they fit or when I put on a tight dress and it looks good.Youre making me want to work out right now. Where did the idea for the 21 Day Fix come from?I started working for Brooke Burkes site Modern Mom and picked up some celebrity clients. Then two years ago, I had the aha moment that I needed to develop something for my clients where theyre going to understand the nutrition side. I was saying, eat three or four or five ounces of chicken. But no one wanted to go get the scale and measure it. I finally sat down with a nutritionist and started brainstorming. We broke down the food groups and came up with 13 different container sizes to fit them. One of my goals was to not eliminate food but teach you how to integrate foods without overdoing it. The goal isnt to be perfect. The goal isnt to not enjoy life. Everyone has to have a glass of wine at some point and a girls got to have a piece of chocolate. But, the goal is not to do it every single day.Americas problem is we overeat everythingeven the healthy stuff.Not the lack of exercise?Its both, but I think at the end of the day, in terms of your weight, its more about what you eat. If youre eating healthy and youre in the right calorie zone, you should be at your proper weight. Exercise will improve your muscles, your flexibility, and your endurance, keep the weight down, and change the appearance of your body. But I see it all the time. Those people who go to the gym five to six days a week but dont eat right are all still overweight. They look the same as they did three years ago. I think looking like youre strong and fit looks better than skinny fat.What is your cheat food?I am usually a cookie or a chocolate person. But, Ive gone so long now without it that when I have it, the sugar rush is too intense. I get headaches and feel nauseous. But, if its that time of the month, I want sweets and every so often a piece of pizza, though I dont eat dairy anymore. But, to be perfectly honest, I dont keep crap in my house. I know what my weaknesses are. I know if you catch me in a bad emotional state and there are Oreos in the house, Im not eating oneIm eating the entire row. Ill feel sick later and Ill make myself pay for it in the gym, but if its there, Im going to eat it. And if its not there, Im not going to get in the car, drive to the store, and buy it. So I might go to bed angry about it and be like, I wish I had some damn chocolate, but Ill get over it.OK, back to the containers. How do they help?We kept them pretty simple. People dont have time to cook gourmet meals, so I based a lot of it on how I had to prep for competition. At the very beginning, it was chicken and Mrs. Dash, 5 meals a day. I was like, OK, I can have turkey, I can have steak, I can have fish. I can buy all the different Mrs. Dash seasonings instead of the same one. Or I can make a stir-fry out of it, I use oil and Mrs. Dash flavors instead of soy sauce. Ive gotten creative, but it takes time. In the beginning, it was like, the recipe says chicken, Im making chicken.Some people who might want to do the 21 Day Fix have a lot of weight to lose. Any thoughts on how they can get a good start and then stay motivated?The biggest thing is to have a support system around you. Have that conversation where you say to your household: This is important to me. Im trying to make a change. Im not forcing you to do it, but I need your support. Please dont try to push me to have things Im not supposed to have. Or, if youre the head of the household, you just say, This is what were doing. I think its important for parents to lead by example. But, at the end of the day, you have to make the commitment to yourself and the only person you have to report to is yourself. Thats a switch that you individually have to figure out how to turn on. Until you can, your weight is going to fluctuate up and down and youll find excuses. Its 21 days. See where you get in 21 days. You may not be perfect. You might cheat. You might have setbacks. But you also cant let those determine how the rest of the future looks. If you cheat, acknowledge it, figure out what triggered it, and get right back on the horse.One of the things I loved about the 21 Day Fix was how awesome my legs and butt looked after three weeks. Why the emphasis on the lower body?The biggest muscle groups are in the lower body, so thats where youll get the biggest calorie burn. Second, its important to be balanced in your upper and lower body. And, finally, Im a leg girl. Im a dancer. I think strong, toned legs are sexy and appealing. And, a guy with scrawny legs? Come on! Youre out. Out! I shouldnt be able to squat more than you."

5 Things My Baby Taught Me About Healthy Eating
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/5-things-my-baby-taught-me-about-healthy-eating,"When I introduced my baby daughter to solid foods, I thought Id be the one to shape her attitudes about food, healthyeating habits, and table manners. But little did I know that in between mashing banana on the wall and painting her face with avocado, she would be the one teaching me how to eat.Heres what Ive learned about healthy eating from my little one so far.1. Try a New Food Again. And Again.I always thought my food dislikes were innate. Thats why I wasnt surprised when my daughter spit out the piece of tomato I fed her. Blech, she said, red juice dripping down her chin. But I would be wrong to give up. A study of 7-month-old infants suggests that if yourepeatedly introduce a new food, even if the baby dislikes it, she will learn to like it.So, if at first you dont succeed, try, try again  at least eight more times, according to researchers. When a vegetable is initially disliked it is worth persisting in feeding it for at least eight subsequent meals.Over the years, Ive learned to tolerate tomatoes, but perhaps I need repeated exposure to olives?!2. One at a Time, PleaseAt restaurants and at home, we love a colorful plate filled with protein, veggies, and a bit of carbs. I was tempted to fill my babys high-chair tray with a little bit of this and that. But Ive found that too much variety on the tray confuses my daughter. Why should she eat her string cheese if theres a sweet strawberry within reach?By limiting the options, you can find out what your baby really likes and help them make good choices.Im not saying we as adults should just limit one food to our plates  but perhaps too much variety can be a bad thing. Studies show that the more choices you have, the harder it is to maintain self-control. So I skip the pu pu platter and the dessert tray if I want to make healthier choices.3. Hold the Salt!But isnt that too bland? my husband said, as I prepared steamed broccoli and roasted cauliflower for the baby.Heres the thing: We might think baby food might be too boring, but when babies switch from an all-liquid diet of formula or breast milk (which has as many flavors as mom eats) to solid food, its a whole new world of tastes, textures, and flavors to them, so theres no need to add salt to the mix.When we first dove into this project, the question was why herbs and spices?' write Alessandra Macaluso and Amy Godiwalla, authors of What a Good Eater!, a cookbook of nutritious recipes for babies and toddlers. During their research, they found that in other countries and cultures, parents added herbs and spices to their babies diets right away, so the question turned into Why not herbs and spices?And since Americans eat too much salt, Ive started subbing in basil, garlic, cumin, mint, onion, and garlic instead of salt  for the whole family. In fact, a small study on infants and salt intake suggests that early exposure to salt may help shape babies preference for salty foods, so it wont hurt to keep salt out of her food while shes experiencing all these new flavors.4. Slow DownIf I give my daughter a piece of food thats too big, she spits it out. If I try to give her a piece of food while shes still chewing, she wont take it. Ditto for a drink. Even if shes eating something she doesnt like  or its too hot or spicy  she wont take a sip of water until shes finished chewing and swallowing. She also likes to stay in her chair and not be rushed.Now thats just good table manners  that shes teaching me! Ive learned to be more mindful of the food Im eating, chew slowly, and take one bite at a time. A less rushed, more relaxed mealtime wouldnt hurt me either.5. Done Is DoneWhen this girl isnt hungry anymore, shes just not hungry. All done! she says. No amount of coaxing or cajoling will convince my stubborn tot to open up that cute little pucker of hers. And why should she? Shes not hungry. End of story.Wish that my husband and I could learn from her! How many times have we said to each other, Im not really hungry, so why am I eating? How many times have I been grazing on chips or popcorn just because the plate was there?In the future, I need to channel my daughter, purse my lips and bang my hands on the table and say, All done!"

Preheat oven to 425F. Line one large baking sheet with parchment paper. Prep the spaghetti squash by slicing it in half lengthwise and scraping out theseeds with a spoon. Season the insides with salt and pepper, if desired, and arrange on baking sheet (cut side down). Place baking sheet in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until spaghetti squash is tenderand shreds easily with a fork. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Leave oven on.2. While the spaghetti squash is baking, prep the vegetables for the week as follows: One at a time, wash, cut, and set each vegetable aside in separate bowls. Remove the skin from the 3 onions and chopinto small pieces. Remove the stems from the swiss chard leaves; reserve 4 large whole leaves for the Hummus Veggie Wraps and chop 3 cups of chard for the Chickpea Vegetable Soup. Rinse the asparagus, cut off the woody part of thestems (about the bottom two inches), thenchop into 1-inch pieces until you have  cup asparagus. Rinse, remove the seeds,and cut a red bell pepper into  cup of thin slices. Rinse and cut cucumber into  cup of thin slices. Rinse and shred 1 cup cabbage. Peel and finely chop7 cloves of garlic. Remove the ends, rinse, and spiralize 3 cups of zucchini (or, use a vegetable peeler to shave the zucchini into long, thin strips). If you purchased whole mushrooms and carrots, slice the mushrooms and shred the carrots, or slice them into matchsticks.Store any unused vegetables for future use.3.Pat yourself on the back. That was a lot of vegetables!4. Once the vegetables are prepped, make the Spaghetti Squash Lasagna. Usea large spoon or fork to scrape the spaghetti squash from itsskin. Transfer to a clean kitchen towelor colander and gently squeeze the squash to remove any excess moisture. Heat 3 tsp. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions and  cup of the sliced mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the onion is translucent and mushrooms have softened (about 5 minutes). Add  cup spinach to the skillet, cooking just until spinach has wilted (about 2 minutes). Remove the vegetables from heat and set aside. Open, acan of diced tomatoes and add  cup of the tomatoes to theskillet and stir to combine. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup ricotta cheese, 3 eggs, and 3 Tbsp. ground flax. Finally, measure and set aside  cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Assemble lasagna in an 8x8 baking dish by layering half of the spaghetti squash, followed by half of the ricotta cheese mixture, half of the vegetable mixture, and half of the mozzarella cheese; repeat layers with the remaining ingredients. Place the baking dish in the 425F preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the cheese is bubbling and begins to turn golden brown. Set aside to cool and turn oven off. Once cool, divide the lasagna into three large storage containers.4.While the lasagna bakes, make the Chickpea Vegetable Soup. In a large saucepan, heat 3 tsp. olive oil over medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions, 3 cloves of choppedgarlic (approximately 3 tsp.), and 1 cups of the sliced mushrooms to the saucepan; cook until the onion is translucent and mushrooms have softened (about 5 minutes). Next, add  cup of shreddedcarrots to the saucepan and cookfor an additional 5 minutes. Open, drain, and rinse two 15 oz. cans of chickpeas. Add 3 cups of chickpeas, 3 cups of vegetable broth, 3 cups of chopped swiss chard, and 3 tsp. of Italian seasoning to the saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmerfor an additional 20-30 minutes until chard is soft. Set aside to cool, then portion into threestorage containers.5. While the soupis simmering, prepare the Zucchini Noodle Stir Fry. Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and placeover medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions, 4 cloves of the minced garlic (approximately 4 tsp.), and  cup of the sliced mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the onion is translucent and the mushrooms have softened (about 5 minutes). Next, add 3 cups of spiralized zucchini and 1 cup of shredded cabbage to the skillet; heat for an additional 5 minutes, making sure all ingredients are well combined. Add 4 tsp. sesame oil and stir to combine. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Once cool, divide the vegetable mixture between 2 large storage containers; top each with 1 or 2 tsp. reduced sodium soy sauce and 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds, then cover and refrigerate.6. Prep the Seasonal Omelettes. In a large skillet, heat 3 tsp. coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions,  cup of the sliced mushrooms, and  cup of the chopped asparagus to the skillet; cook until the onion is translucent, and mushrooms and asparagus have softened (about 5 minutes). Next, add  cup spinach to the skillet, cooking just until spinach has wilted (about 2 minutes). Next, prepare three individual omelettes. For each, whisk 2 eggs, seasoning with salt and pepper, if desired, andcook in a small skillet with 1 tsp. coconut oil. Cookeggs over medium-low heat until eggs are set, then place  of the vegetable mixture in center of eggs and fold ends over. Repeat all steps two more times. You may choose instead to make a scramble: Heat 3 tsp. coconut oil over medium heat, add 6 scrambled eggs andall cooked veggies, stirring until eggs are set. Divide between three containers. Serve with a slice of whole-grain toast.7. Make the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes by adding  cup ricotta cheese, 6 eggs, 1 cup rolled oats, and 4 tsp. fresh lemon zest to abowl and stirring until batter is smooth. In a large skillet, heat 1 tsp. coconut oil over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter into skillet, using approximately  cup of batter for each pancake, and making 3 pancakes per batch. Repeat process of heating more coconut oil and making pancakes until all batter is used. Note: we made 12 pancakes in 4 batches; however, if using a smaller pan, reduce the amount of coconut oil you use per batch. Divide pancakes between 2 storage containers. When ready to eat, top with  banana and drizzle with freshly squeezed lemon juice if desired.8. Next, prep the Hummus Veggie Wraps. In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Add  cup uncooked quinoa, reduce heat to low, and cover for 15 minutes or until quinoa is tender. Set aside to cool. To make two large wraps, lay fourlarge swiss chard leaves on a work surface in stacks of two (or, make four smaller wraps). Spread each stack of chard with  cuphummus. Place cup red bell pepper slices,  cup pre-washed spinach,  cup sprouts,  cup matchstick carrots, and  cup cucumber slices in the center of each leaf. Add  cup cooled, cooked quinoa to each. Tightly wrap swiss chard leaves aroundeach stack of vegetables, rolling each into the shape of a burrito. Secure wraps with toothpicks if needed. Place into two food storage containers.9. Prep the Greek yogurt snack by placing cup yogurt and 1 Tbsp. chia seeds into fivestorage containers. Top each with one peeled orange divided into segments. Place in fridge.10.

What to Do After a Binge to Get Back on the Weight-Loss Track
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/what-to-do-after-a-binge-to-get-back-on-the-weight-loss-track,"Heres the not-so-dirty secret: Everybody binges at some point. Think about the last time you declared, Just one chip, but finished with an upended bag of salty crumbs on your lips. What about that holiday feast turned food coma? The fact of the matter is it happened, and theres no use pretending it didnt.What Is a Binge?A binge is overeating in a short period of time. You go past satisfying hunger, despite feeling stuffed with food  and oftentimes regret. A binge happens unintentionally, unlike a cheat meal, which you can plan into a healthy eating regimen. Binges can occur periodically, as in Thanksgiving dinner, or over a stretch of time like a weeklong cruise to Cancun featuring all-you-can-eat crab legs.Keep in mind that were talking about a binge, where you overindulge, and not a consistent pattern of binging that may be a sign of a more serious eating issue. To read more information about eating disorders, visit the National Eating Disorder Association.Your 5-Step Guide to Beat the Binge (and the Bulge)Just because we all binge at some point doesnt mean we cant beat the bulge. A binge can be discouraging, especially if youve just started to see progress on the scale. Follow these five steps, so you can get back on track after a binge:Step 1: Do Emotional Damage ControlUnless youre a special kind of saint, binging will make you feel lousy. Guilt, shame, worthlessness, and disgust can be knee-jerk reactions post-binge. Catch yourself immediately! You cant change the past or let this binge define you. Here are a few tips to reign in your gloomy thoughts:Reframe the situation. This binge session is not going to tank your progress. Your weight is affected by how much you eat averaged over a long period of time. Think of this binge as a learning opportunity, and use it to course correct for the future. It may be helpful to jot down your thoughts in a journal for when you can look back on this moment with a clearer mind, and glean insights from it.Get your mind off your mood. Feeling blue? Call up a close friend and plan something fun that doesnt involve food. Now is the time to distract yourself with a hobby you love (yoga, anyone?). Bonus points if it involves light exercise.Dont weigh yourself. Binging is a hard blow, especially if your self-esteem is tied up in your shape and weight. Its tempting to weigh that food baby, but do yourself a favor and stay off the scale for now.Step 2: Pick a Fallback Nutrition PlanSo, you inhaled a large pepperoni pizza, now what? All that excess calories, fat, refined carbs, and salt can make you feel bloated and tired. After dealing with the emotional hurdles of a binge, refocus your effort to get back on the healthy-eating horse. Theres no one answer to how to do this, but here are a few options you can try:Get back on the healthy habits horse as soon as possible. Resume an appropriately portioned, balanced diet. Word of caution: Despite tons of calories post pig-out, you may feel hungrier than normal the next morning. This is likely due to the sugary, high-glycemic index nature of most binge foods, which can spike blood sugar and stimulate hunger.Focus on fluid and fiber. If youre like me, youll get a bit queasy thinking about your binge foods. On the flipside, a fresh salad or tangy fruit-and-veggie smoothie sounds like pure bliss. If this is you, kick off your post-binge meal with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and water. The combination of fluid and fiber makes digestion more efficient, which helps move your binge food right on through your system. Avoid loading up on calorie-dense, high-fat foods at this point, as these will slow down digestion.Try out a non-gimmicky reset. Depending on the bigness of your binge, you may want to slate about two to three days to recuperate. If you do better with a solid meal plan in place, try the Beachbody 3-Day Refresh program. You can get back on track while eating nutritious fruits, veggies, and good-for-you fats.Step 3: Resume ExerciseObviously, dont hit the pavement running moments after you lay down your post-binge fork. Intense exercise on a full stomach is barf-worthy, so give yourself time to digest. Feeling antsy? Do a brisk walk with your dog or walking up and down the stairs several times. When youre fully digested (think: the next day), you can sweat through a killer workout. The excess glycogen stored from your binge can deliver a burst of energy to fuel your next jog, CORE DE FORCE workout, or HIIT session. The key here is that youre exercising to be a healthier, fitter you, not to earn extra calories for food.Note: If you try a cleanse, you may want to go easy when it comes to exercise intensity, as the cleanse will tax your body (and energy reserves) enough on its own.Step 4: Think Binge PreventionBe comfortable with the fact that you may binge again. Then, work on ways you can safeguard yourself from the next binge:Notice the warning signs. Instead of reaching for a tray of Oreos, reach deep down inside and figure out why you desire a binge. Oftentimes, binging is a coping mechanism for tension or other taxing emotions. If this is the case, brainstorm some non-food ways to deal with your emotions. Also, dont be afraid to get help. A health professional can help you figure out your binge triggers and find better ways to cope.Dont keep binge foods in the house. If you know certain foods can trigger a binge, by all means remove them from your home. You may not have established an appropriate relationship with those foods yet. Once you do so, they can be reintroduced into your home. Again, a health professional can help you figure this step out.Dont binge on autopilot. Next time youre mid-binge, take mores pauses to assess the situation. Understand that at any point in your binge you can stop. Just because youre satisfying an urge to binge doesnt mean you need to let it play all the way through. Pace yourself and try to enjoy the food.Loosen up your diet. For some, eating a restrictive diet (think: calorie-pinching to the point where youre constantly under-eating) for a long period of time can lead to a binge. If this is you, liberalize your diet and allow some of the foods you love back in modest amounts. Beachbodys Portion-Fix Containers can help you get a better idea of the right-for-you amounts of different foods to eat. A healthful diet should allow you to enjoy them without guilt.Practice mindful eating. Mindful eating helps you learn the difference between physical hunger and emotional arousal, so you can consciously make the right call to eat. Research shows strong evidence that mindfulness can reduce the frequency and severity of binges.The Final Phase of a Post-Eating Binge: Be Kind to YourselfLosing weight and getting to a healthier you is a journey, so you need to be patient and kind to yourself. Healthy eating for life is more about moderation, balance, and quality, and this is just one binge. With time, you will progress and learn more about what will and wont work for your body. Until then, dont beat yourself up!"

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/transformation-tuesday-lisa-lost-39-5-pounds-with-21-day-fix-extreme,"After having her first child, Lisa H. wanted to become a fit and healthy mom. She began21 Day Fix EXTREME, and lost 39.5 pounds after 8 rounds! Read on for her story in her own words:I saw an old friend (who then became my Coach) post about a 21 Day Fix Challenge Group. I had a newborn at home and was so disgusted with myself, I knewthis was my chance to make a change.I had let myself go after my pregnancy. Iwas a mess postpartum. Pre-pregnancy, I was running and going to the gym. Post-pregnancy,I basically gave up. I was eating whatever I wanted because it seemed to make me feel better. Even when I thoughtI was eating healthy, I soon learned that I wasnt.My goal was to lose some of the weightI had gained during my pregnancy. I wasnt able to even lift my son out of the bathtub without holding onto something, and even then, it was tough. I wanted to be able to become a fit and healthy mom!The beginning wastough. I was out of shape and embarrassed at the way I looked! But I started to notice small changes after every weekI was becoming happier.More clothes were starting to fit. I was becoming more confident.I soon needed all new bras and workout pants, as I had to hold them up to workout!I loved that the workouts are only 30 minutes. It was perfect to do at home, while my son slept soundly in his crib. I didnt have to find a babysitter and drive to a gym, and I kept the baby monitor right next to the TVtalk about extra motivation!  I like the combination of allof the types of workoutscardio, plyometrics, pilates, yoga, upper, lower I had never used a combination of all of these before starting 21 Day Fix EXTREMEand I am so thankful I chose this program to start! I also found it very motivational, and loved that there was a modifier to follow during the very tough times in the beginning!Ilovedworking out with Autumn! I think I have every motivational quote she uses during the workouts memorized! It was easy to relate to her, being a mom herself. She helped me throw all of my excuses out the window, and let me know that despite what people say about not being able to shape a certain part of your body, (especially after a c-section!), you can do anything with hard work and dedication!I reached my goal! It was an amazing feeling. I felt like a totally different person than when I began my journey! My goal was to lose all of the weight I had gained and get back to my pre-pregnancy weight, and I surpassed that goal and lost an extra 10 pounds! I celebrated by buying myself my first pair of size 6 jeans, along with an entire new wardrobe! I bought a new weight bench and started buying new pieces for my at-home workout space!Its a year later and I am stillhearing compliments! People can see how truly happy and confident I am, and that makes me really happy. One of my favorites was when in September when the custodian at my school asked me where I went. I said, Oh, I went to Nashville this summer. He said, Im not talking about vacationIm asking where the other half of you went!'You can change your life, too.

How to Share Yoga With Your Kids
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/how-to-share-yoga-with-your-kids,"The holidays are a time of family and togetherness. We gather around the living room for storytelling and around the table to feast. Why not extend the fellowship to the yoga mat?Kids love yoga since they enjoy playtime and naturally live in the present moment. Sharing just 20 minutes of yoga with the children at your family gatherings is a chance for you to connect and have fun while doing something active, and it doesnt cost you a penny.Yoga also gives children the opportunity to get creative. While you are teaching the kids the 5 kids yoga poses below, allow them to make up a few on their own and teach you! Sharing yoga to the littles in my family have brought much joy to our holiday gatherings and I hope they will for you, too!Here are 5 Yoga Poses to Share with the Kids in Your Life:1. Invisible chairChildren see magic everywhere! Instruct chair pose with, Bend your knees like youre sitting in an invisible chair. Standing with your feet hip width apart, shift your weight back into your heels, and drop your hips knee level. Reach the arms up overhead as you lengthen through the spine, and most importantly keep that heart open and smile!2. Happiest baby poseHave the children lie down on their backs and bend their knees with their feet facing the sky. Have them hold the outer edges of their feet and draw the knees down outside the armpits. Kids are usually very limber and this pose can help keep them this way. It opens the hips and releases tension. My niece likes to rock side to side in this pose and give herself a bonus back massage. And rememberwere not just happy babies, were the happiest babies! Dont forget to laugh!3. Three-legged dogLet the little ones show off their acrobatic skills by coming into a downward facing dog and reaching one leg up toward the sky. Kids typically enjoy the bent-knee/ hip-opening variation of this pose, and adults can certainly benefit from this stress-relieving variation as well. Just keep the core strong, the low back long and straight, and the chest facing the mat, as you open up the lifted hip and create some space.4. Cat-Cow posesMy little guys have a cat named Dobby (named after a character in the Harry Potter book series) who does this pose every morning. All humans should do the same as its a great energizing pose to get your day started right. This flowing movement from cat to cow pose is a fantastic stretch for the spine, as we experience both spinal flexion and spinal extension for a greater range of mobility.For the cat-cow stretch, come to a table-top position by placing your hands on the mat under the shoulders and bend the knees under the hips. For cow pose, drop the belly, lift the chin, pull the chest forward and tilt the tailbone skyward, stretching the core region. For cat, bring your chin to your chest, press into the mat with your hands and lift your upper back toward the ceiling and your belly toward your spine while tilting your tailbone toward your knees. Move from cow to cat poses fluidly with the breath. In these poses, kids love to mooo like a cow, then meow like a cat.5. Reverse table topThis is a great chest opening and shoulder stretch. For adults, its the perfect counter-pose to all the chaturangas and planks we do in yoga class. For kids, its a great opportunity to bend and stretch themselves into the shape of a familiar piece of household furniture, which is so much fun for them.For more funand basic yoga poses you can try with your kids, or keep for yourself, check out Beachbodys3 Week Yoga Retreatwhere I, along with three other yoga experts guide you throughthe fundamentals ofyoga."

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/cize-results-karen-lost-22-6-pounds-in-60-days,"Karen was struggling to lose the baby weight, but nothing seemed to work for her. She heard about CIZE being a dance themed program andwas immediately drawn to give it a try. She lost 22.6 pounds after just 60 days! Read about how she did it below:I was having insecurities with my body after having twokids and not losing any pregnancy weight. It led todepression and relationship issues with my family and friends.I would cry almost every day because Ihated how myweight affected me. I hit my breaking pointand knew it was time for a change! I wanted the old Karen back!Before having twokids, I was a professional dancer. I thought that the moves in CIZE wouldlet me get back to mydancing roots. I tried every workout before this, but none of them seemed to work and I quickly got bored. CIZEwas the perfect fit from day one.I loved that the program was aboutdancing. Although I was getting the most out of my workouts, Shaun T made it feel like Iwas in the studio again. Instead of it feeling like a workout, I felt like I was getting ready for mynext show! I started to feel better and better.Each day was challenging, but as I kept going and shedding more and moreweight, my stamina increased.After completing the program, I am so happy andmore energized. I am excited to go out with my friends, my relationship with my husbandand daughters isbetter because of my positive attitude, andI cant wait to shareCIZE withmygirls when they get older. I hope to inspire others who feel the way I felt and wantmake a change. My journey doesnt end here!

Beachbody Results: Marc Overcame Unhealthy Habits and Lost 38 Pounds!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-marc-overcame-unhealthy-habits-and-lost-38-pounds,"Marc White, age 35, lost 38.2 lbs with Shakeology, the Beachbody Performance supplements, 10-Minute Trainer, 22 Minute Hard Corps, and INSANITY MAX:30. He entered his results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I was a miserable, over weight, lazy truck driver. I worked long hours and was always eating fast food. At my heaviest I weighted 257 pounds. I was unhappy, unhealthy, and hated my life. I hated my body, and how I felt all the time. I always had back pain and never had any energy to play with my kids. I was taking all of my frustration out on my wife and kids (mentally not physically) and there was no need for that. My body was frumpy and flabby. I had boobs and a pot belly. I would never take off my shirt because I didnt want people looking at me. I wouldnt take my kids to the pool or the beach because I didnt want to be judged. My self confidence was shot and I was truly unhappy and unhealthy.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My wife and two baby boys (Jr who is 2 & John who is 1). They are my inspiration to live a healthier life style and be the best me I can be. I was out of work for 8 weeks with an inguinal hernia.3 While laying on the couch I had my line in the sand moment. I wanted to be a better father, husband and man. After completing 90 days of the 10-Minute Trainer, I have more confidence to do different programs, but because of my inguinal hernia Im limited to what programs I can do.3 My doctor said 22 Minute Hard Corps would be a great transition from the time of the trailer, and its only 22 minutes out of my day. When I add Cold-start and Core its still less than an hour. With two baby boys, thats perfect. Now that I have completed INSANITY MAX:30, I am inspired to push myself mentally harder than ever before. This program was great for that.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The greatest challenges I faced was recovering from this inguinal hernia and trying not to over do it.3 I was cleared by my doctor but told to listen to my body. I started with the 10-Minute Trainer and moved to 22 Minute Hard Corps. Another challenge is time to work out because of my two baby boys. I overcame this by picking a program that was good on time (less than an hour). I also woke up earlier so I have extra time if needed. The biggest challenge with MAX:30 was the mental aspect. Shaun T push me harder mentally than physically. To do 3 more reps when I am ready to quit was big for me. I have grown from this program and now I am ready to take on any program I put my mind to.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?10-Minute trainer was perfect for me when I was starting out. Having two baby boys, its not easy to get to the gym, or even do a 30-minute workout. 10-Minute Trainer is perfect for anyone with no time. I set my alarm 10 minutes earlier to fit my first workout in. Time management is great with this program. Also, the meal plan is amazing. It is simple to follow and easy to replace what you dont like to eat. I am a picky eater and it worked perfectly. Another plus is I lost weight doing it. The mental workout of INSANITY MAX:30 was by far the best thing from that program. MAX:30 push my mind as well as my body. I never thought I would be able to do 8 weeks, but I did! The mind is so important when it comes to exercising. Form and mind control go hand-in-hand.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I have achieved so much. My energy and lower back pain are by far the best. I used to have lower back pain, but, since doing the 10-Minute Trainer, I have built up my core muscles and the pain has gone away. My energy is sky high. I am always playing with my boys now, and Im not sluggish or moody. I know thats from proper nutrition. I also have to admit, the weight loss is special too. Im very proud of my arms. 16 1/2 inches is amazing results. Also, I can feel the abs under my belly fat so I know after round two of MAX:30 I will have more defined abs. I really love the Ultimate Performance Stack, and how it made me feel. Since MAX:30 I am able to do jump tucks, which is big time for me. I was able to also do 3 more reps when I was ready to quit. I am so proud of these 2 things.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My life is changed in so many ways. I have made new lifelong friends and I learned so much about myself. I no longer eat fast food, or even have cravings for fast food. I eat healthy, and I will continue to eat healthy using the meal plan for the program I am doing. I am feeling better and better each day about my body. After completing 90 days of the 10-Minute Trainer and 2 rounds of 22 Minute Hard Corps, I was ready to try INSANITY MAX:30. I did do the modified track mostly but towards the end of the program, I was doing no modified moves. I have a long way to go, but I come a long way from where I started. I like my new mindset on a healthy lifestyle. I have more energy to keep up with my kids and when I walk, Im no lover winded. My health has improved, my energy has increased, and my stamina has increased, which are all great benefits. After completing INSANITY MAX:30, Ive noticed I am more confident in myself. I have a feeling that anything I put my mind to I can complete!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Its the best thing ever! I have tried a lot of diets and work out programs, but nothing like this one. The Challenge Group held me accountable as well as gave me the support to keep at it. The members never judged me and were all kind and friendly. I made new friends and I feel like we will be life-long friends. Everyday I posted my sweaty pic, my post work out video, and one meal I ate each day. Just those 3 acts had me engaged. It felt like the perfect family.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?I can talk for hours about Shakeology. I drink Shakeology every day now and I will not miss a day ever! Its my daily dense dose of nutrition. I have more energy from drinking it. I think and act clearer. I noticed that its putting the veggies I dont eat into my system. I sleep better at night. I no long feel sluggish. Im always smiling and feeling great. My mood is always pleasant.2 I have come up with 56 home made recipes including my favorite protein bars. I drink it twice a day and I will continue to drink it for the rest of my life. Its great in the morning when both boys wake up, and I dont have time to cook myself breakfast. Its perfect for lunch time when I dont have time to make lunch. The individual packs are great for travel. I keep a sampler pack in my book bag. Since drinking Shakeology Ive reached my goal weight of under 200. I also started the Ultimate Performance Stack which I would highly recommend to anybody and everybody. Energize gets me going in the morning with no crash. Hydrate keeps me hydrated and has eliminated my headaches. Recover has gotten rid of my soreness after workouts. Creatine has made my arms go to 16 1/2 inches and recharge is amazing. Every time I drink recharge I have the best night sleep. The Recover made a huge difference in the program. It really does work!2 My digestion system is running smoothly and my doctor said this is the best health hes seen me.2 This is just the beginning.You can change your life, too.

Healthier Thanksgiving Desserts
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/healthier-thanksgiving-desserts,"Even if your dinner guests have stuffed themselves to the point of food comas on Thanksgiving, theyll always expect to be offered dessert  and probably more than one option for dessert. After a couple hours pass and the turkey haze wears off, people will likely seek a sweet way to end the feeding frenzy. Our roundup of healthier Thanksgiving dessert ideas include all of the spice, pumpkin, and apple flavors familiar to an autumnal buffet, but with more figure-friendly ways to savor them.21 Day Fix-creator Autumn Calabrese and her brother, chef Bobby Calabrese have put together an incredible menu of Fix-approved Thanksgiving recipes for their new cooking showFIXATEthat are healthy versions of your favorites. From Green Bean Casserole and Cranberry Sauce to stuffing and Pumpkin Whoopie Pies, theyve got you covered.Check out FIXATE here!Pie RecipesPumpkin Pie with Whole Wheat CrustThis is the real deal here: a sweet, spiced pumpkin custard with a tender crust that will certainly appease any pumpkin pie devotees. Its not as sweet as store-bought pies, and the crust is far more interesting than a conventional frozen or prefab pie crust made with all-purpose flour. Our version combines whole wheat flour with old-fashioned oats and ground almonds to create a shell thats hearty without being too dense. Get the recipe for Pumpkin Pie with Whole Wheat Crust.Pecan and Sweet Potato PieThis ones for those who waver between the pumpkin or sweet potato and pecan pies at the dessert table and end up getting slice of each because they just cant choose one. Instead of granulated sugar and corn syrup, our version is sweetened with pure maple syrup, dates, and sweet potatoes. A touch of ginger adds a spicy, autumnal note and makes this pie unique. Get the recipe for Pecan and Sweet Potato Pie.Banana Honeymoon Shakeology PieBanana cream pie, anyone? Even better: Peanut butter and chocolate banana cream pie! We snuck in extra protein with two scoops of Chocolate Shakeology not that anyones counting macros on turkey day, but still. A high-protein dessert for less than 300 calories per slice is called winning. Get the recipe for Banana Honeymoon Shakeology Pie.Pumpkin, Pumpkin, and More Pumpkin RecipesPumpkin Coconut CustardThis elegant, slightly exotic-tasting number is ideal for more formal dining (read: the adults table) when you plan to serve dessert as the final course. These tender, creamy custards are baked in individual ramekins  perfect because no one will want to share the addictive combination of coconut and pumpkin spice. Get the recipe for Pumpkin Coconut Custard.Pumpkin CookiesThese cookies are like handheld crust-free mini pumpkin pies. Created with the familiar flavors of the quintessential Thanksgiving pie, you get pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves studded with chopped pecans for extra richness. Get the recipe for Pumpkin Cookies.Pumpkin BreadPaleo pumpkin bread may not sound like the treat your kid brother and uncle will be vying for the last piece of, but this bread simply uses coconut oil instead of vegetable oil or butter, and a mix of almond and coconut flours instead of white flour. You get the same moist pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spices, and extra cinnamon that youd expect from this seasonal staple. Get the recipe for Pumpkin Bread.Peanut Butter (and Pumpkin) Shakeology CupsSo this one seems like it might make more sense for Halloween, but the chocolate-covered peanut butter gets moisture (and a boost of fiber and vitamin A) from pumpkin puree  this also brings it closer to the texture of the peanutty goo thats inside the brand-name peanut butter cups. Get the recipe for Peanut Butter Shakeology Cups.Apple RecipesApple CrispThis is the autumn dessert for people who dont like baking. All you have to do is peel and chop apples, mix ingredients together in two bowls, put the spiced apples into a baking dish topped with an oat topping and youre done. Keep an eye on the crisp after its been baking for 25 minutes; once the apples are soft and the oats are browned, its ready to devour. Get the recipe for Apple Crisp.Slow Cooker Baked ApplesThis recipe could be even easier than the crisp mentioned above, and it has built-in portion control. While most of the other traditional Thanksgiving recipes vie for a spot on the stove or in the oven, this dessert can be prepped in minutes and placed in the slow cooker. You can literally set it and forget it for two hours while it perfumes your kitchen with apples and cinnamon. Get the recipe for Slow Cooker Baked Apples.Apple Raisin CakeRedolent of an apple Dutch baby or a German apple pancake  minus the puffy exterior  this cake is light, tender, and moist. Instead of butter or vegetable oil, it uses small amounts of extra-virgin olive oil and chopped walnuts to give the cake just enough richness and texture. Get the recipe for Apple Raisin Cake.If youre looking for additional healthy Thanksgiving recipe inspiration, check out our Ultimate Healthy Thanksgiving Guide, which includes all you need to know about buying, thawing, and roasting a turkey."

4 Common Food Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/4-common-food-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them,"Youve got two goals on your to-do list: Exercise more and eat healthy. Youre crushing the exercise goal and it wasnt as hard as you thought it would be. Your eat healthy goal, however, has been more of a challenge.But youre making it work: cooking more at home, packing lunch for work, and cutting sugar out of your coffee. Despite all of that, your fat loss has all but sputtered out. Have you hit the dreaded plateau?Good news: Probably not. Bad news: You think youre eating better, but youre probably not.Find out if youre making these four common food mistakes and how to get on track.1. Not Watching Your PortionsAvocados are good for you  but not when you put an entire avocado on your toast. Eating clean doesnt mean you have free reign to eat as much as you want; there actually is such a thing as too much of a good thing.Example: Hummus can be a delicious, healthy food, but a serving size is two tablespoons  not half the container you normally enjoy with your baby carrots. Be mindful of how muchyoure eating: Use a food scale, measuring spoons, or portion-control containers to make sure you arent overdoing it.2. Not Watching Your SugarBy now, we all know that too much sugar in your diet is not a good thing. The American Heart Association advises no more than six teaspoons of sugar per day for women and no more than nine for men. The problem is that even if youre cutting sugar from your coffee and kicking your candy habit, youre only addressing the obvious sources.Sugar (added sugar, not naturally occurring sugar in fruits and vegetables) is in pretty much everything we eat, even foods you wouldnt think contain sugar  bread, sports drinks, salad dressings, granola bars, yogurt, and pasta sauces all contain added sugars.Sugar also goes by many different names, so it can be hard to spot on a food label. Look for words that end in -ose and ingredients like cane juice, turbinado, dextrin, and malt syrup.You can still eat sugar as the occasional treat  in moderation. There are times when a little added sugar may benefit you, particularly in a well-designed supplement, such as the way it replenishes glycogen in various Beachbody Performance products.3. Drinking Your Fruits and VegetablesJuicing is an easy way to get your daily fruits and vegetables, but that green juice may not be as healthy as you think it is. Most juicers remove the pulp (or fiber) from the fruit. But the fiber in fruits and vegetables is just as important as the vitamins and minerals in the juice:Fiber helps you feel more full and slows down the digestion of the fruit and vegetable sugars, so you dont get that blood sugar spike.Juices also lack fat, and fat can help your body absorb key vitamins like A, D, E, and K more easily. A smoothie with protein, fiber, and fat is a more balanced option.4. Ordering a SaladAll salads are healthy, right? Nope. Dont assume that a salad is automatically the healthiest or lowest calorie choice when you eat out. Example: A chicken avocado salad at a popular restaurant chain weighs in at a whopping 1,870 calories. And McDonalds kale salad? Its loaded with more calories and sodium than a Double Big Mac.The culprit is usually the dressing, but the high-calorie count can often be tied to serving size (see #1) and additional toppings like cheese, nuts, and candied fruit. Dont be afraid to ask for the extras on the side; that way, you control what to add to your salad. Chain restaurants are required to provide calorie and nutrition information, so read the fine print before your order. Better yet, check the menu online before you go and decide what you want before you get there.Eating better doesnt have to be hard  the key is to be mindful of what and how much youre eating and youll be well on your way to crushing that eat healthy goal."

Healing Hip Pain With Exercise and Lifestyle Tips
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/healing-hip-pain-with-exercise-and-lifestyle-tips,"I knew something was wrong the day I couldnt get out of my car. My mind said, Stand up but my groin said, Thats not happening. A sharp pain radiated from my hip halfway down my leg. This had never happened to me before. I stretched, whimpered, and waited for the dagger-in-the leg sensation to ease up.I was convinced Id pulled a groin muscle, but my orthopedic doctor told me that I suffer from osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Turns out Im not alone. According to the Center for Disease Control, one in 4 people will develop OA during their lifetime. The disease is so prevalent that, in 2011, there were 512,000 total hip replacements performed, 80 percent of them because of osteoarthritis.This is the most active that people have ever been in the history of the earth, says Jay Lieberman, M.D., professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgeons at Keck School of Medicine at USC in Los Angeles. So were seeing increases in hip injuries, knee pain, really every part of the musculoskeletal system.Why Does My Hip Hurt So Much After Exercise? ?To understand the origins of the big ouch, you have to understand the mechanics of the hip. Its a ball and socket joint, explains Lieberman. The vast majority of people who develop OA have a structural abnormality in the hip joint.In laymans terms, this means the ball and the socket just dont fit perfectly, says Lieberman, who also currently serves as president of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. Around the hip socket is a ring of cartilage called the labrum, which acts like a gasket. The labrum is your friend.It not only helps to hold the femoral head, which is the ball part, into the hip joint socket  it also keeps the fluids that nourish the cartilage inside the joints, he explains. For people with osteoarthritis, over time the hipbone starts to bang against the labrum ring and eventually you tear it.Repetitive motions (like elliptical training or pedaling a bike) in some sports may irritate it. This is what happens to countless athletes and active Baby Boomers, such as Yankee star, Alex Rodriquez, who may require a hip replacementat some point.When to See a Doctor for Chronic Hip PainPatients usually complain of pain in the groin or buttocks that usually gets worse with activity, he says. If you have a labrum tear, you may also notice a catching [or a shifting or tugging] sensation in your hip and some stiffness after activity.Normal every day motions that you never thought twice about become a struggle. As the disease progresses, youll have trouble putting on your shoes and socks, getting in and out of car, and also feel increased pain walking, Lieberman says.If the hip pain lasts longer than 46 weeks, its time to seek medical attention. He may be a little biased, but Lieberman recommends seeing an orthopedic surgeon, who will do a careful physical exam and X-ray. At the beginning of the disease the X-ray findings are subtle, he says, and somebody whos not trained to look at it could say, That looks pretty normal to me. But there are certain things that you have to look for in the X-ray, or you may have to get an MRI.How to SupportHip Health and Minimize Hip PainAvoid pounding, jumping, runningDepending on what your doctor discovers, he or she may first recommend anti-inflammatory pills and modifying your routines so theres less stress on the hip. If you regularly jog or play football, basketball, soccer, ice hockey, tennis, or baseball, Lieberman suggests picking a different activity so you can get your cardio without continually irritating the hip joint. He doesnt recommend running on concrete or a treadmill either.Channel your inner Michael PhelpsLiebermans go-to exercise recommendation is swimming. Its rare for me to hear from a patient that swimming irritated her hip, and the reason for that is if one stroke bothers you, you can try a different stroke, he says. Other hip-friendly activities can include hiking, skiing, surfing, and using the elliptical machine. He doesnt recommend running on concrete or a treadmill at allGo easy on your yoga and PilatesDont start any new exercise after your hip pain kicks in, of course. But if you are already an experienced yogi or Pilates veteran, Lieberman says its fine to continue your practice with modifications so you dont tempt the pain. Choose poses and exercises that dont irritate the hip.Ice, ice it, babyTheres not enough ice used in the world, laments Lieberman. Professional athletes are completely iced up after they play. They may be in total body ice, or have their arm, elbow, or knee iced. The Arthritis Foundation encourages giving your joints an ice bath after any vigorous activity. For the most effective results, put an ice pack on your groin and butt. (Seriously.)Get physical, therapy, that isIf you can swing it, find a trained physical therapist to give you a workout routine specifically designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles around the hip. Its better to have formal physical therapy to make sure youre doing the exercises right, Lieberman says, even if you only go once. Physical therapists will focus on stretching your tight outer hips and glutes.Get a rub downEspecially for osteoarthritis sufferers, Muscles around the hip can get irritated because the mechanics of the hip are off, says Lieberman. Some people say (any kind of) massage helps them feel more comfortable, and it helps with their pain, so Im certainly not against it.Neither is my hip."

7 Weird-Looking Fruits and Veggies and How to Eat Them
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/7-weird-looking-fruits-and-veggies-and-how-to-eat-them,"If youve been hanging around the produce section at your grocery store lately, you may have noticed there are more and more downright weird-looking fruits or veggies. Dont worry, its not the zombie apocalypse. Grocery stores are starting to get the memo that shoppers want a wider variety of healthier choices, and even small supermarkets are bringing in more exotic produce.The good news is that these strange-looking fruits and vegetables dont require a lot of fancy cooking skills. Many can even be swapped in for the produce you eat regularly. We chatted with Chef Shawn Harrison, whose seasonal creations feature some of the most out-there plants weve ever seen, for tips on how to integrate seven weird-looking fruits and veggies into your weekly meal plan.1. Black RadishThis charcoal-skinned variety of radishes is quite pungent. They can be eaten raw, but slice them thin because the skin is tough. If theyre too pungent for you, cook them to tone down the flavor.Nutritional benefits: Like other cruciferous vegetables, they contain glucosinolates, which can support healthy cholesterol levels and the gallbladder.How to Eat Them: These are potent, so a little goes a long way. I quick-pickle them: Toss thinly sliced black radishes with rice vinegar, tamari, ginger, a bit of sugar and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Let sit overnight.Chef Shawn boils them in salted water, then chills, sears in a cast-iron skillet and roasts them. This is a great tip for those who are new to their pungent flavor.Storing: Refrigerate as you would regular radishes. Discard the green tops if you dont plan to eat them.Sourcing: A cool-weather crop, theyre available at farmers markets or specialty grocers. Choose radishes that are heavy and firm, with crisp greens. Avoid ones that feel squishy or have blackened stems.2. JackfruitNative to Southeast Asia, these giant fruit have a neutral taste and stringy texture when eaten young. Jackfruit is becoming a favorite meat substitute (seriously) for vegetarians.Nutritional benefits: This unique fruit contains vitamins B6 and C, plus potassium.Storing: Whole jackfruit should be stored on the counter.How to Eat Them: Chef Shawn likes it slow-roasted and pulled with BBQ sauce to mimic pork.I turn it into avocado chicken salad: Mash an avocado, then add about two cups of (cooked and cooled) jackfruit, minced red onion, raisins and chopped walnuts, plus Dijon mustard, salt, pepper and dried tarragon to taste. Serve in lettuce cups.Sourcing: Find whole jackfruit as well as canned varieties (packed in brine) at Asian markets, or buy the flesh prepackaged at health-food stores. Jackfruit smells sweet when ripe, so choose those without a scent if youre planning to turn it into a meat substitute. Confession: I almost always buy the prepackaged refrigerated versions because its so much easier!3. KohlrabiThese bulbous root vegetables are in the cruciferous family, and they taste a little like broccoli stems, radishes or cabbage. When young, theres no need to peel them, but larger, older kohlrabi has tough skin that should be removed. They can be eaten raw or cooked.Nutritional benefits: Kohlrabi shares the same benefits as other cruciferous vegetables, and it traditionally has been used to support healthy blood sugar levels.How to Eat Them: Chef Shawn turns kohlrabi into a slaw with oil, vinegar and herbs. (Try it with his jackfruit pulled pork tip above!)I like to peel and cube kohlrabi, toss it with olive oil and plenty of spices like paprika and cumin, then roast it with sweeter root vegetables like parsnips and sweet potatoes. You can also spiralize it and steam it for a lower-carb pasta swap.Storing: Refrigerate roots for up to two weeks. Remove leaves if you dont intend to cook them or use them within a few days.Sourcing: Find them with the other root veggies at your supermarket, usually in summer and fall. Kohlrabi should be heavy and firm, without any brown spots. If the greens are attached, they shouldnt be wilted.4. KumquatsKumquats look like baby oranges, but theyre actually their own variety of citrus. They can be eaten whole, though youll want to discard the seeds. Warning: The peel is sweet and fragrant, while the flesh is sour!Nutritional benefits: Like the rest of the citrus family, theyre full of vitamin C, plus dietary fiber.How to Eat Them: Chef Shawn slices them and adds to salads with a bitter green such as arugula.I like to dice them and add to a mango or pineapple salsa for additional texture and a sweet-and-sour contrast. You could also add them to guacamole or, on the sweeter side, sprinkle a few slices atop vanilla fro-yo.Storing: On the countertop as you would oranges.Sourcing: Find them fresh in winter (citrus season) at grocery stores or preserved as marmalade at gourmet food shops. Like oranges, theyll be fragrant when ripe with firm, blemish-free skin.5. PersimmonsWhile the Japanese variety of these sweet fall fruit are more commonly known, theyre also native to the United States. When ripe, their flesh is sweet and pulpy, and they resemble an orange tomato. They can be eaten raw or cooked into a pudding or other sweet treats.Nutritional benefits: They contain vitamin C as well as fiber.How to Eat Them: Chef Shawn eats them raw or sliced in a salad with other fruits. I like that option, but I also like to mix the ripe flesh into chia pudding, oatmeal and smoothies. Dice dried persimmons, and add to oatmeal or trail mix.Storing: Let ripen on the counter, then use the flesh immediately or pure and freeze.Sourcing: Find persimmons fresh in the fall at supermarkets or at Asian markets, where you can also find them dried year-round. You likely wont find them ripe in markets, as they get quite soft. Buy them when firm, and let them ripen on your countertop.6. RomanescoThis cruciferous veggie looks like an alien version of cauliflower. Its nearly neon green in color, with a mesmerizing fractal pattern. Though it looks too beautiful to eat, you can use it raw or cooked, exactly as you would cauliflower. Instead of slicing it, break it into florets to preserve the beautiful natural clusters.Nutritional benefits: Similar to green cauliflower, nutritionally speaking, it contains plenty of vitamins C and K.How to Eat It: Chef Shawn likes to roast romanesco to get a nice brown color. Roasting sweetens any vegetable, so this preparation can appeal to picky palates.I often steam it lightly to preserve as much of that gorgeous color as possible, then serve drizzled with pesto or a bright lemony vinaigrette. It also makes a lovely addition to a veggie platter.Storing: Refrigerate for a few days in the crisper.Sourcing: Find romesco at farmers markets, or if youve got the space, you can grow it yourself if you live in a region with long, cool summers. Pick heads with tight clusters and no brown spots, and avoid those that feel soft or with greens that are starting to wilt.7. Sunchokes (Jerusalem artichokes)These root veggies are actually a variety of sunflowers. Theres no need to peel their knobby skin before boiling or roasting (though you can if you prefer), and their flesh is sweet and nutty when cooked.Nutritional benefits: Rich in the prebiotic fiber inulin, which may support healthy gut bacteria. (Word of warning: Start slow with sunchokes, as inulin is indigestible and can lead to gas and bloating if eaten in excess.)How to Eat It: I am among those who have GI issues with these, so I tend to use them sparingly though I love the flavor. Like kohlrabi, theyre a delicious contrast to other root veggies when pured or roasted. Pure steamed sunchokes and cauliflower with olive oil, lemon zest and a sprinkle of nutmeg for a light yet decadent side dish.Storing: In a cool, dry place, as you would potatoes.Sourcing: Find them at farmers markets or with the root veggies at larger supermarkets. When fresh, they should be firm and smooth yet knobby. Pass over those that are soft, dark or wrinkled. Tip: Sunchokes are definitely knobby by nature, but choose those with fewer knobs if you plan to peel them."

Beet It: 5 Unique Ways to Eat More of This Healthy Veggie
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/beet-it-5-unique-ways-to-eat-more-of-this-healthy-veggie,"Its undeniable  beets are having a moment. Beets are showing up in juices, smoothies,burgers (yup), food blogs, and of course, more Instagram posts that you can shake a stick at. These gorgeous veggiescant be beat for beauty, so itd be easy to pin the buzz on their photogenic star-power, but it isnt all about looks. The humble beet has legit nutritional street cred and may even have promising results for athletic performance.The Benefits of BeetsA cup of beets is 60 calories and a good source of fiber, potassium, iron, and folate. This root vegetable is naturally low in fat, cholesterol-free, and low-sodium. And dont toss the greens! Youre basically getting two nutritious veggies for the price of one: Beet greens are packed with vitamins A, K, and C. You can prepare and eat them like you would any salad greens.Do beets improve athletic performance? For some, possibly. A recent review of 19 studies suggest benefits for non-athletes, ranging from 14 to 25 percent improvements in endurance during activities like cycling or rowing. There were mixed results for trained athletes, with some significant but small benefits, but more studies need to be done. Want to give it a try? The research suggests most benefits are seen with drinking about two cups of beet juice two to three hours before exercise. You can find beet juice at most grocery stores now, juice bars, or you can make your own at home if youve got a juicer.Kitchen TipsBeets, or beetroots, have an earthy, mildly sweet flavor. Commonly a deep garnet red, they can be golden, white, and sometimes a mix in the case of the Chioggia or candy cane beet (a cross section looks like an archery target).Look for firm, smooth skin, and crisp bright greens.Smaller ones are generally more tender.They can be eaten raw or cooked.Cut greens within an inch of the stem before storing.Gently rinse before cooking, taking care not to damage the thin skin. Peel after cooking.To keep the gorgeous red color on your plate and off your shirt, Cheryl Meyer, RD, recommends using surgical gloves during prep.Bathroom alert: You may see a reddish hue in your toilet for a few days after eating them.Not ready to commit to a batch of beet burgers just yet? Then try these five unique and delicious ways to add more beets to your life.1. Pickled BeetsFor the tangy bright notes of a pickle and the perks of gut-friendly probiotics, try fermenting beets at home. If you go for store-bought instead, beware that only those labeled as fermented or with probiotics likely contain probiotics.2. Roasted Beet Ice CubesRoast some beets, puree them, then freeze in ice cube trays. Add four or five beet cubes with one cup pomegranate juice, one cup frozen blueberries, one teaspoon chia seeds, and a drizzle of agave (optional). For another option, Amber Ketchum, M.D.S, R.D. loves adding cinnamon to her beet smoothies to cut through the earthiness.3. Spiralized BeetsSpiralizing vegetables is almost as trendy as beets. Saut them with garlic and olive oil and garnish with fresh mint and toasted pistachios. Its a great side dish on its own, but its also delicious on goat cheese crostini. Amanda Hernandez, M.A., R.D., offers another great option: Spiralize them raw and marinate with olive oil, vinegar, and black pepper.4. Beet Dip (Romesco or Hummus)Use beets in a rustic romesco or hummus recipe for an unexpected take on these traditional dips. Romesco is a classic Spanish sauce similar in texture to pesto thats made with roasted red peppers, tomatoes, almonds and garlic. You can slather this delicious dip/sauce on everything from toast to baby carrots. Just take your favorite romesco recipe and sub in beets for the roasted red peppers. To make a gorgeous beet hummus, just add beets to this easyhomemade hummus recipe.5. Beet ChipsKim Melton, R.D. says her family likes beet chips with hummus as a healthy snack. Her method: Thinly slice your beets, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and bake. (Beet chips with beet hummus, anyone?)When you want to go back to basics, remember that the simplest way to enjoy beets is to roast, slice, and toss them on a salad. A favorite from Amy Gorin, M.S., R.D.N. is greens, beets, avocado slices, and crushed almonds or hazelnuts, with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar reduction. Voila  beet heaven."

8 Reasons to Try Flotation Tank Therapy
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/8-reasons-to-try-flotation-tank-therapy,"Lets play a game of Would You Rather:Would you rather  spend 90 minutes getting a deep-tissue massageor spend 90 minutes floating in a soundproof tank of water in the pitch dark?Before you answer, I fully acknowledge that floating, or float therapy, encompasses pretty much everyones childhood fears: the dark, water, being in the dark in water. But as someone who was (and still is) afraid of those things, I can tell you that floating is just as good as a massage.What is Floating?Back in the day, floating took place in sensory deprivation tanks for science experiments, not for relaxation. Research on the effects and benefits of sensory deprivation have been ongoing since the 50s, starting with the work of neuroscientist John C. Lilly. He created the original sensory deprivation tank and preferred dropping acid before he floated. (Dont do that.)In the 70s, Dr. Peter Suedfeld and Dr. Roderick Borrie came up with the less ominous descriptor Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy, or REST. Far from being some hippy-dippy, way-out-there fringe subject, there are numerous studies on REST and its effect on hypertension, chronic pain, addictive behaviors, weight loss, and more.Nowadays, people float for a variety of reasons and its popularity is growing rapidly: The number of float therapy studios in the U.S. has grown from about 50 five years ago to more than 250 studios today, says Jeff Ono, founder of Pause float studio in Los Angeles.What Does Floating Feel Like?There are two common types of tanks or pods: the clamshell, which looks like a gigantic plastic egg with a hinged top and the walk-in tanks for all you claustrophobic types.Once youre in the tank, floating in hundreds of pounds of Epsom salts dissolved in hot water creates a trippy, yet soothing experience: The salts keep you bobbing on the surface and body-temperature water helps you lose any sense of being in water. The effect can be disorientating at first, but then you actually feel like youre floating in space.It took me awhile to truly relax on my very first float; I worried about getting saltwater up my nose, bumping into the walls, being trapped in the tank (none of which happened). But once I got settled, the complete lack of sound, light, and distractions was hypnotic. After awhile, Im pretty sure I fell asleep. While floating in water. Beat that, deep-tissue massage.Here are 8 reasons to try flotation tank therapy:1. Floating really is getting away from it all. How many times have you been told how important it is to make time for yourself? Probably a lot. And how many times have you been interrupted by phone calls or texts or doorbells or kids when you try to do just that? On the other hand, its hard for someone to text you or ask you for something if youre floating naked in closed tank of water.2. Floating is all about you. Youre in control. You control everything about your float: the lights, no lights, music, no music. If you want to get up and walk around in the middle of your session, you can. If you want to paddle around in circles, you can. Its all you.3. Floating is fun. I tend to sink right to the bottom of any body of water that I get into, so the sensation of floating on water is pretty groovy. It can take a few minutes for your body to relax into the water, but once you do, you feel absolutely weightless.4. Floating may be physically and mentally therapeutic. Preliminary studies suggest it may help with a host of issues, from insomnia to headaches. Other studies have shown that float therapy may help reduce stress-related pain and anxiety.More and more alternative therapies like cupping and floating are going mainstream: Elite Olympians and athletes like gymnast Aly Raisman and the entire Golden State Warriors lineup are fans of floating to recover physically and mentally.But you dont have to be a professional athlete to reap the benefits. Floating eliminates muscle soreness, reduces my join point and relieves pressure in my head, and headaches vanish, Ono says. As I age, the amount of time I spend hunched over a desk is growing, so I carry a lot of discomfort in my back. Floating releases this tension. It is almost as if my back has been actively stretched during the session.5. Floating helps your brain turn off. OK, this one is clearly not a science-backed claim, but I can vouch for the fact I wasnt thinking about anything when I was in the tank. Not about my to-do lists, what to make for dinner, how much those new tires are going to cost  nothing. It was glorious to just be. (Although, technically, thinking about the fact youre not thinking is, well, thinking, but you get my drift.)6. Floating may spark your creative juices. Small studies show that participants displayed more creativity after a REST session. When I come out of the pod and read, I absorb everything. Creatively, it enhances my imagination as well as my memory, Ono says.7. Floating will turn your skin as smooth as a babys butt. Again, not scientifically proven, but anecdotally, I can attest to the fact that my skin and hair were silky smooth post-float.8. Floating is what you make of it. Thats the beauty of float therapy: Some people float for physical recovery, for a meditative or spiritual experience, but if thats not what youre into, you can float simply to relax and take some time for yourself.3 Float Mistakes You Do Not Want to Make Dont shave, get a tattoo, or otherwise have unhealed scratches or cuts. Salt water in an open wound = bad. Dont drink lots of liquids beforehand. (Enough said.) Do not, I repeat, do not rub your eyes once youre in the tank. Seriously. Salt water in your eyeballs is almost, if not more painful, than salt water in an open wound.Floating may not be for everyone, but in an increasingly plugged-in, turned-on world, its more important than ever to find different ways to give body and your brain a break to recharge.Photos courtesy Pause float studio."

3 Veggies Meat Lovers Can Get on Board With
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/3-veggies-meat-lovers-can-get-on-board-with,"Youre not alone if you live for the deep, complex flavors of beef, pork, or chicken thats been slowly marinated, seared, or kissed by the flames of the grill.And guess what? Even if youre trying to get more vegetables in your diet (really, who isnt?) you can still enjoy those same techniques and flavors with plant-based entrees and sides.Despite what you might have encountered at bad hotel buffets and school cafeterias, veggies dont need to be mushy and bland. In fact, some of the most delicious ways to prepare meat  marinating, searing, and grilling  are also some of the tastiest ways to prepare your favorite veggies, too. Dont put your barbecue in storage just yet. Instead, add these vegetables alongside, or in place of, those cuts of meat.1. MushroomsMushrooms are basically meat in disguise. The fungi share the savory, earthy flavors and hearty texture of animal protein. All varieties of mushrooms can be prepared almost exactly as meat, and for this reason are frequently used by chefs as stand-ins in meatless versions of Beef Wellington, Stroganoff, burgers, and much more. You can use almost any mushroom variety, but portobello, baby portobello and cremini have the most meat-like texture and flavor.Bun-sized portobello mushrooms work as a direct substitute for burger patties or chicken breasts. Brush them with olive oil or ghee (clarified butter), then place them right on the grill.Or, cut mushrooms into bite-sized chunks as you would with pieces of beef, slide them onto a skewer along with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes, and toss them on the grill. You could also marinate them in your favorite sauce as you do with proteins.Three easy homemade sauces to start with are chimichurri, barbecue, and orange marinade.2. EggplantThis rotund purple veggie is like a great actor waiting for the role of lifetime, and youre just the director to give it to him.After slicing the eggplant to the desired thickness, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with spices, and set straight on the grill. If steak gets you out of bed in the morning, youll be surprised by just how much you love this steak as it takes on the starring role at dinner. Eggplants hearty texture and the meat-like crispiness of its grilled edges may just win you over.3. CauliflowerThis cruciferous vegetable finally took over kales spot as the beloved foodie veggie this year and for good reason. Its extremely versatile. Crisp it up by broiling or roasting in the oven; pulse it in the food processor to create rice; or although the texture isnt an exact match, swap it directly for chicken  these genius Buffalo Cauliflower Bites will make you a believer."

7 Tips to Save Money at the Grocery Store
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/7-tips-to-save-money-at-the-grocery-store,"We already know that cooking at home can help us eat healthier  and even eat less. But can you do itwithout breaking the bank? Absolutely: You can save money on grocerieswithout making extreme couponing your new hobby.Were skipping the obvious ways to cut costs (sign up for coupons from favorite brands and wait for sales we know you got that). Instead, were sharing seven real-life tips and tricks to keep your budget in check while still filling your cart with fresh, nutritious food.Try These 7 Easy Tips to Save Money1. Be FlexibleArmed with your list and your meal plan, you head to the market to stock up. Then you see theres no asparagus  and you do a double-take at the price of strawberries. Rather than scrapping your entire plan, pull out your recipe ninja skills.If you need collards but kale is on sale, make the swap. If chicken breasts are a better deal than turkey cutlets, revise the menu. To change up ingredients without affecting the integrity of a recipe, keep items as similar as possible: No nectarines? Choose peaches. Arugula overpriced? Find a different bitter green. Fresh basil too pricey? Use parsley (or go with dried).2. Join the ClubA five-pound bag of raw almonds, a double-size container of baby spinach and a three pack of low-carb wraps  youll be able to find the kitchen staples you need for your healthy diet, be it Paleo, vegan, or anything in between.Tip: Split the membership fee with a friend. Since the official member needs to be present, youll get BFF time while you grocery shop just skip the samples.3.Go Price ShoppingNo club nearby? No problem. Amazon Prime, Thrive Market, and Vitacost are among the sites offering good deals on groceries  including kid-friendly fare. (Thrive and Amazon also have apps, so you can compare prices while at the grocery store.)Bonus: Buying some of yourgroceries online could help you eat better. According to research, ordering food ahead of time may lead to healthier food choices and fewer splurges. Talk about a sound endorsement for meal planning!4. Ignore the LabelsDont overlook the nutrition facts. Instead, ignore the front of the label, says Kristen Arnold, R.D.N., L.D., M.S. The only difference is the taste, and a lot of times the store brands taste better than the name brands, says Arnold, whos also a professional cyclist. Youll save an average of 25 percent and store brands were deemed as delicious as the name brands more than half the time.Splurge on any product where the specific seasonings and ingredients matter  like salsa or premium ice cream  but save on staples like diced tomatoes, low-sodium broth, and Greek yogurt.5. Do the MathThe larger container is usually  but not always  the best deal. Read shelf tags to see which option has the lowest cost per ounce or pound. This will help you decide whether the 12-ounce jar on sale for $4.99 or the 16-ounce jar for $6.99 is a better deal. Another tricky move? Those 10 for 10 sales. Peek at the other items in that category (and the non-sale price) to see whether youre really saving.6. Shop the Bulk AisleMainstream supermarkets now offer everything from flour and sugar to tamari-roasted almonds and candied ginger in bulk bins. Youre not paying for fancy packaging or marketing, so the prices are lower  and you can take only what you need. Arnold relies on bulk items to keep her food bills low, and beyond the bins, she loads up on bags of sweet potatoes and apples  its cheaper than buying them loose.Tip: Get kids excited about healthier snacks by letting them scoop ingredients for their very own trail mix.7. Carry a BasketIf you just need a few items, dont tempt yourself with extra space. As you fill your basket, youll feel the weight of each item you add to it, which could make you think twice about picking up a half-gallon of ice cream or anything else thats not on your list."

9 Genius Slow Cooker Tips for Easy Meal Prep
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/9-genius-slow-cooker-tips-for-easy-meal-prep,"The allure of easy, healthy slow cooker recipes is undeniable. Who doesnt enjoy a delicious meal that takes minimal effort to create  not to mention one that works miracles on the toughest (and most affordable) cuts of meat?To help you make the most of this all-star appliance, weve rounded up nine stellar slow cooker ideas. Use them for meal prep or just for the next time you need to bring a big batch of something to an event. Either way these tips will help you cut down your time in the kitchen.1. Make a mass of protein to use all week longOne of the simplest, smartest ways to streamline your weekly meal prep is by slow-cooking a large batch of one protein on the weekend, and then adding it in to multiple dishes throughout the week. Shredded chicken is extremely versatile; try it in salads, sandwiches, rice bowls, tacos, and burritos. Pulled pork and meatballs are also flexible options.2. Meal prep like a bossFind a slew of slow cooker recipes and spend a weekend afternoon chopping and assembling the ingredients into labeled, freezer-friendly bags. The night before you cook, move the bags into the fridge so they can thaw. Youll save time by prepping en masse, and youll also cut costs by purchasing items, such as meat, in larger, value-priced packages.3. Batch cook your breakfastsDinner isnt the only meal magically transformed by slow cookers. Wake up from dreamland to a piping hot breakfast with overnight slow cooker dishes such as steel-cut oatmeal, savory frittatas, farro and quinoa bowls, and casseroles. The cook-while-you-snooze strategy is also perfect for hearty weekend lunches. If youre freaked about leaving an appliance turned on while you sleep or are gone during the day, check out the last tip about smart tech.In addition to one-off breakfasts, you can slow-cook a whole weeks worth of breakfasts in one go with a large batch of oatmeal (such as this Slow Cooked Steel-Cut Oatmeal with Apples and Cinnamon). Store it for several days in the refrigerator, or freeze individual portions.4. Simmer in your slow cooker instead of on the stoveDried beans, pasta sauces, chicken stock, granola all these staples can be slow-cooked in large batches to help you throw together meals easily. Try this Slow Cooker Refried Beans recipe, which can be frozen for up to three months.5. Make a double batch to enjoy now and laterFrom hearty stews to your favorite chili, some slow cooker recipes taste just as good, if not better, as leftovers. With a large slow cooker its easy to make extra and get two meals for the work of one. Cant stand a repeat dinner in a single week? Just choose freezer-friendly recipes and stash half to enjoy in a few weeks.6. Treat your oven to some time offTackling a bunch of recipes at once for a big dinner or holiday feast? Solve the traffic jam for the oven and stove by delegating a side dish to the slow cooker, such as baked and mashed potatoes, stuffed peppers, sauces, and even fruit crisps and baked apple desserts.7. Hack the shredding stepInstead of the typical method of pulling apart cooked chicken and pork with forks, fast-forward the process in seconds with a potato masher or hand mixer. Dunk the masher or mixer right into the pot to shred the meat, then let it laze in the saucy pool before being spooned onto plates.8. Eliminate tedious pot scrubbingYou can skip post-meal soaking and scrubbing by using slow-cooker liners, many of which are BPA-free. Use them once and toss for quick cleanup.9. Go high-techTo avoid having to babysit your slow cooker or rush home from work, invest in one with a digital timer that automatically switches to the warm setting once the cooking time is up. Even fancier: some models are WiFi-enabled and can be controlled with your phone. Now if only they could make one that chops all the vegetables too"

The 8 Best Dry Shampoos to Try
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/the-8-best-dry-shampoos-to-try,"Washing your hair every day is for the birds  and bad for your hair. Enter dry shampoos, a veritable gift from the hair gods. This miraculous beauty product saves time, prevents damage to your luscious locks, and is incredibly versatile: You can spritz it on after a workout or use it to perk up your hairs between washings. You can even use it on clean hair to add texture.Forget the days of sprinkling baby powder in your hair and attempting (in vain) to brush it all out. Dry shampoos come in both aerosol and powder form and leave zero trace.Here are my top dry shampoo picks to keep your coif looking and smelling fresh.1. Suave Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo $4.99 (4.3 oz.)Suave makes one of the best inexpensive dry shampoos on the market. Keratin is a protein found in your hair (and nails and skin) that protects it from damage from heat styling and chemical treatments. The keratin in this particular dry shampoo can also help your hair look shinier and smoother  and who doesnt want that?!2. Not Your Mothers Clean Freak Dry Shampoo $6 (7 oz.)This is another great basic dry shampoo if youre a gal who doesnt want to spend too much money. It doesnt do much else besides freshen up your roots, but for the price, its really all you need. A great clean scent with super absorption, this product hits the mark.3. Batiste Dry Shampoo $7.99 (6.73 oz.)This dry shampoo can hang with the most luxe dry shampoos on the market. Batiste is one of my personal favorites for three reasons. 1. It comes in a wide array of fragrances, from floral to fresh and powdery. 2. It comes in various color formulas for women who want to touch up their roots in between salon visits. 3. Its an unbelievable price for what you get. Depending on where you buy it, the price ranges from $5.99 to $8.99.4. Bumble and Bumble Pret-a-Powder $12 (.3 oz), $24 (2 oz)Bumble and Bumble is well-known for its styling products, but this is definitely one of the lines shining stars. This fantastic powder is super absorbing and also pumps up the volume. Its great for all hair types, but especially good for women with thin hair who are looking for that extra oomph.5. Captain Blankenship Mermaid Dry Shampoo $14 (2.4 oz.), $24 (4.8 oz.)If youre an all-natural kind of woman, youll love this one. Captain Blankenships line is made from organic plant and mineral materials. Bonus? Its scented with rose and geranium essential oils.6. Kardashian Beauty Take 2 Dry Shampoo $14.99 (5.3 oz.)Before you start hating, I have to say I was honestly impressed by this dry shampoo. The magic sauce is black seed oil derived from the Nigella sativa plant, which has a rich history as a folk remedy for a wide array of ailments, though the jury is still out on what it actually does for your hair. Either way, as a dry shampoo, its well-priced for how it performs: It smells intoxicating, absorbs excess oil, and doesnt weight your hair down. Done and done.7. Drybar Triple Sec 3-in-1 $26 (4.2 oz) $13 (1.6 oz.)The tagline for this product is texturize, amplify, refresh  and they arent kidding. Its everything the name promises and is worth the price. The smell is amazing  a yummy vanilla-like scent  and exactly what you want to spray on your hair to give it a lift after work before heading out to happy hour (or a date!). The travel-sized option is perfect for your purse or desk.8. Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray $44 (8.5 oz.), $22 (purse size)Oribe is one of the most luxurious haircare brands on the market. Their products are not kind on the wallet, but theyre definitely kind on your tresses, and boy, do they smell good. Theyve even created two different perfumes from the scents they use in their haircare line: Cote dAzure with notes of lemon, bergamot, and orange and Silver Pearl, which blends mint, water lily, green fig, and bamboo.The Dry Texturizing Spray isnt technically a dry shampoo, but the award-winning spray is a cult classic and is widely used in the beauty community. It can be used as an alternative to classic dry shampoos, and doesnt leave any powdery white residue. It also adds fantastic volume and creates a tousled texture. Spray it all over your hair, not just the roots, to vamp up your look."

Skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/skinny-buffalo-chicken-dip-recipe,"Buffalo wings: two words that scream cheat meal. Each tiny wing, fried and smothered in buttery hot sauce, can have about 165 calories. Order them in a restaurant, and youll get a dozen or more of those calorie bombs, usually served with a creamy dip oh, and a smattering of celery sticks that do nothing to redeem the healthiness of the meal  or appetizer for some. One could make a wishful case that the effort of stripping the small amount of meat from the bones burns calories, but that kind of argument is doomed to disappoint.But they taste so good; what is a lover of Buffalo wings to do?Under unlikely circumstances, I had an idea to make Buffalo wings and their accompanying dip so lean and clean that it might even pass for a healthy snack.A friend brought a casserole dish filled with her moms famous Cheesy Buffalo Wings Dip to a potluck. It was a deliciously addictive abomination that was much faster easier to shovel into my face eat since the meat and dip were already combined in a heavenly vat of bad-for-you. But after a few dozen bites, I realized that the dip could be easily revamped to remove most of the fat and calories without diminishing the flavor. I scooped up a few more bites to make sure.This skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip is the result of that junk food binge (you might say I took one for the team). Shredded chicken breasts replace the fattier dark meat, and a combination of Neufchatel (look for it next to the cream cheese in the grocery store) and Greek yogurt give it the creaminess of a dip. We added part-skim Mozzarella to make this cheesy like my friends dip, but you could substitute part or all of that for more Greek yogurt to make yours even leaner. Tangy hot sauce and a little bit of crumbled blue cheese create the familiar flavor of Buffalo chicken. Combine everything and bake until bubbling; serve hot with raw veggies like celery sticks, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, or cucumber slices, and enjoy!Tip: Put this Skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip together quickly using leftover baked chicken breasts or rotisserie chicken that has been shredded with a fork.Skinny Buffalo Chicken DipTotal Time: 0 min.Prep Time: 10 min.Cooking Time: 30 min.Yield: 8 servings, about  cup dip and  cup veggies eachIngredients:2 oz. Neufchatel cheese, softened1 cups reduced fat (2%) plain Greek yogurt cup shredded part-skim Mozzarella cheese cup cayenne pepper hot sauce cup crumbled blue cheese1 cups shredded cooked chickenNonstick cooking spray4 cupsvraw vegetables (like celery sticks, carrots sticks, jicama sticks, cherry tomatoes, and cucumber slices)Preparation:1. Preheat oven to 350 F.2. Combine Neufchatel cheese, yogurt, mozzarella cheese, hot sauce, blue cheese, and chicken in a medium bowl; mix well.3. Place in a 1-quart baking dish that is lightly coated with spray. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and edges begin to slightly brown.4.

9 Healthier Breakfast Recipe Makeovers Under 350 Calories
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/9-healthier-breakfast-recipe-makeovers-under-350-calories,"Out of the three squares a day, breakfast  especially weekday breakfast  gets the shaft. We often neglect it, abandon it, or grab the nearest bar/baked good/fill in the blank with whatever packaged food is within reach. We get it; we do it, too.Advanced meal prep can help solve the what-healthy-thing-to-eat dilemma at all times of the day, but it can be particularly useful for the first meal of the day, which is often a last-minute scramble. If you take some time to plan on the weekend, you can have more healthful and generally lower calorie versions of the fallback foods you love for breakfast available just as conveniently as those store-bought or drive-thru foods.Need more convincing? Look at all of the tastiness you can get for less than 350 calories:Breakfast QuesadillasFor those mornings when you worked out so hard you can almost feel yourself wasting away, or you had one too many the night before and the drive-thru seems like the only way to make peace with your angry stomach and throbbing head, or fluffy eggs and oozing cheese are the sunshine you need to tumble out of bed, these breakfast quesadillas are about to become your new BFF. These crisp, warm, melty pockets of fast-breaking joy can be macgyvered to suit any palate, and can be made in advance and reheated for busy weekdays.What youll need:2 tsp. olive oil1 medium onion, chopped1 medium red (or orange) bell pepper, chopped2 medium jalapeos, seeds and veins removed, finely chopped (optional)3 large eggs, lightly beaten4 large egg whites ( cup)4 (8-inch) whole wheat tortillas1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheeseFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 301Mozzarella and Egg Breakfast SandwichIf you want more handheld scrambled egg goodness, our veggie-spiked take on that popular drive-thru breakfast classic involving English muffins gets a meat-free makeover. We trim the saturated fat by using part-skim mozzarella and one whole egg plus two egg whites. We amp up the flavor with roasted red bell peppers and fresh basil for a Mediterranean spin on the egg sandwich, but feel free to add whatever floats your boat.What youll need:1 large egg2 large egg whites1 Tbsp. low-fat milkNonstick cooking spray2 Tbsp. chopped roasted red bell pepper2 Tbsp. chopped fresh basilGround black pepper (to taste; optional)1 slice part-skim mozzarella cheese ( oz)1 whole wheat English muffin, split, toastedFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 316Spinach and Broccoli StrataThree words for you: Bread, eggs, cheese. Make that melted cheese. Who doesnt want that for breakfast? Strata, a casserole made usually with day-old bread and a cheese-spiked milk-and-egg mixture, can not only be a life-saver brunch idea (Have you ever invited friends or family over for brunch only to be trapped in the kitchen, flipping omelets?) but also a life-saver make-ahead meal idea. Bake off a dish of this Spinach and Broccoli Strata and you can have breakfast for the entire work week (plus extras!).What youll need:Hot water4 cups broccoli florets4 tsp. olive oil1 medium onion, chopped2 cloves garlic, finely chopped8 large eggs, lightly beaten2 cups reduced-fat (2%) milk2 cups raw spinach, chopped1/2 tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)1/2 tsp. ground black pepperNonstick cooking spray8 slices low-sodium sprouted whole grain bread, cut into 1-inch cubes1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 1 1/2 oz.)Find out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 233Chocolate Peppermint MuffinsSome of you might be thinking: Enough of the savory already. Wheres the sweet? We hear you. And these Chocolate Peppermint Muffins are gonna rock your world. Sweet, refreshing mint and rich cocoa flavor aside, these moist and crumbly handhelds contain just 133 calories per muffin. You read that right. This means you can have two for breakfast and still be under 300 calories total. For those with an aversion to gluten, there isnt even a pinch of flour in these; we use chickpeas for structure.What youll need:1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained, rinsed3 large eggs1/2 cup raw honey1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 tsp. baking soda3 Tbsp. coconut oil, melted1/2 tsp. pure peppermint extractFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 133Blueberry Maple MuffinsChocolate not your thing? Its hard for anyone to resist a warm blueberry muffin  that tender, yielding crumb, that tart and sweet burst of berry, that whisper of vanilla and sugar that lingers. But, as muffins (and, well, all food portions) get bigger and bigger, all of those comforting refined carb calories can stack up quickly. Our remake keeps everything we all love: fresh blueberries, sweetness (from maple syrup), and richness (from coconut oil), and combines it with healthier ingredients, such as whole-wheat flour, wheat germ, and low-fat buttermilk.What youll need:Nonstick cooking spray (optional)1 cup whole wheat flour3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour1/4 cup wheat germ1 1/2 tsp. baking powder1/2 tsp. baking soda1/4 tsp. fine sea salt1 tsp. ground cinnamon2 large eggs1/2 cup pure maple syrup1 cup low-fat buttermilk1/4 cup coconut oil, melted1 tsp. vanilla extract1 1/2 cups fresh blueberriesFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 156Gluten-Free Banana BreadThis aint your grandmas banana bread. Props to granny  her bread is perfectly delicious, moist, and comfortingly sweet, but all those refined carbs and not much protein or fiber to help redeem it. Our more modern take on this old-fashioned staple makes it safe for gluten-intolerant and gluten-sensitive folks, and is great for those watching their cholesterol. This doesnt mean its not tasty. Were not the types to offer you a banana-flavored piece of rubber (Have you ever tried an oil-free quick bread? Doesnt it remind you of rubber?). Our banana bread recipe walks the line between rich (we swapped butter for coconut oil) and healthy (5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving), and it hits all of the flavor notes  banana, vanilla, warm cinnamon spice  you expect.What youll need:1 1/4 cups almond flour1 1/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour1 1/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, gluten-free1/2 tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)2 tsp. baking soda3/4 tsp. baking powder1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon6 large ripe bananas, mashed1 tsp. pure vanilla extract1 large egg, lightly beaten3 Tbsp. extra-virgin organic coconut oil, melted1/2 cup pure maple syrup1/4 cup unsweetened almond milkNonstick cooking sprayFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 274Mocha Caramel Latte ShakeologyCant stomach much early in the morning except for that mandatory coffee? We have just the thing for you. This Mocha Caramel LatteShakeologyrecipe has all of the sweet caramel and chocolate flavor of a frosty dessert beverage. But, instead of being loaded with sugar syrup and cream, its a healthy snack that wont bust your diet. The secret that makes this recipe taste as good as the original: the caramel extract. Real caramel is made by melting butter, cream, and sugar three ingredients that anyone with fitness and nutrition goals should generally avoid. But caramel extract provides the same buttery, burnt-sugar flavor without any of the guilt. Its a game changer for your sweet tooth.What youll need:1 cup unsweetened chocolate almond milk1 scoop Caf Latte Shakeology1 tsp. pure caramel extract1 cup iceFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 207Cinnamon Raisin GranolaIf you love cereal and have since you were a kid, theres no reason to give it up. Just try making your own at home so you can control the quality of the ingredients. While our version takes some time to bake, the ingredients are easy to assemble. Youll need to babysit the oats while they toast in the oven (stirring every 15 minutes so they dont burn), but this is the perfect recipe to make while youre meal prepping for the week, doing chores around the house, or helping the kids with their homework.What youll need:Nonstick cooking spray3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats2 cups rolled wheat flakes (or barley flakes)1/4 cup unsweetened frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon1/2 cup raisins1 cup slivered raw almonds (or chopped walnuts or chopped pecans)Find out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 180Cranberry Granola BarsThis ones for those who love granola, but dont have the extra time to sit and enjoy a bowl of cereal in the morning.

Theyll also be taking over the Beachbody Facebook and Instagram channels, so make sure to tune into both!Meet Ericka. Shes a 56 26-year-old trainer who grew up in Princeton, New Jersey and used to dance for the Brooklyn Nets. She now lives in Los Angeles and is ready to get you  and your booty  in shape with her dance/barre workouts! Watch new episodes of THE 20s on Beachbody On Demand every Monday to support #TeamEricka!How did you get into fitness?My mom put me in dance when I was three, so that kind of started that whole thing. I went to college at the University of the Arts for dance. Ballet, modern, jazz I did everything, but my favorite is hip hop. I danced professionally for the Brooklyn Nets for two years out of college until I moved out to LA.What brought you to LA?I remember the moment I realized I needed to move to LA. I would commute to New York from New Jersey every day and I was waiting for the train. It was pouring rain. I was freezing and I had my suitcase with all my costumes and I was like, its time. I need some sun.Did anything change when you got here?It wasnt really until I moved out to LA that I fell into fitness. My roommate was the only girl I knew here and she taught cardio barre. I hadnt heard of it before, but I fell into that and fell in love.I did it once before. Those little baby weights are misleading!I know! People are like three pounds is not bad. Im like, just wait. Youll be with those three pounds for a while. Its very different. Its cardio and toning but youre using different muscles. And its a lot of stretching, which people tend to stay away from.In terms of nutrition, did you grow up eating pretty healthy?I did not. I would come home from school and go through chips, macaroni and cheese, etc. It wasnt until my mom had a heart attack at 39  shes ok  but four stents later we took everything out of the fridge and replaced it with delicious, whole, healthy foods. It was definitely an adjustment but it was a wake-up call and we did it together. At that point I realized what you put into your body is about more than looking good. Its about feeling good and being healthy from the inside out.What sort of nutrition plan do you follow now?I eat about six small meals a day and Im a vegetarian.What are some of your favorite vegetarian proteins?I love lentils, Greek yogurt, and eggs.Do you drink Shakeology?I do! I love Chocolate. It tastes like brownie mix to me. I like throwing in a banana and maybe a scoop of peanut butter and its the perfect shake.Before we go, tell us: whats your favorite workout move?Probably leg lifts at the bar. I love working the booty and its definitely a great burn.What other moves do you recommend to work the booty?I like using your own body weight. I do barre squats and leg lifts, leg lifts even on the floor. Leg lifts for days, pretty much. You dont need to squat to get a big booty. It helps, though.Tune into THE 20s today to see the first episode and watch new ones every Monday! Who will become the Next Beachbody Super Trainer? Youll have to watch to find out!

I was feeling pretty lazy, so it wasnt hard to convince me to avoid battling the traffic jam ofshopping carts at Whole Foods.I decided topostpone myusual Sunday afternoon meal prep session andgo read a book at the beach instead. It was totally worth it.But, in the back of my mind, a little voice chidedme that bylunchtime on Monday, Id regret skipping my meal prep, and probably hit a tacotruck. That night,I created a menu that I could easily execute with almost no cooking. I made a quick trip to the grocery store for supplies once the sun had set, which is a much less crowdedtime to shop as it turns out! The next morning (yes, Monday morning before work), I slapped together this meal prep in record time.Since no cooking was required, most of the meals are meant to be served cold. But,I wanted to have at least onehot meal, so I created the Shrimp and Veggie Rice Bowl with raw broccoli and snow peas. When you heat it in the microwave, covered with a wet paper towel, the veggies will steam to a perfect tender crisp. You can also heat everything in a pan on the stovetop.Mymenufollowsthe simple, color-coded Portion Fix eating plan atthe1,5001,800 calorie level.

If you did not buy cooked brown rice, start by steaming the rice. Combine 2/3 cup brown rice and 11/3 cup water in medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil; cook, covered, for 1520 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let rice rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Do not remove lid. Open lid and fluff rice with a fork; let cool completely. Set aside.2. If you did not buy hard-boiled eggs, place six eggs in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator. Serve two hard-boiled eggs with an apple and 2 tsp. of nut butter.3. Make the Coconut Mango Chia Pudding (we adjusted the recipe to make three servings). Remove the lids from three mason jars. In each, place 1/8 cup chia seeds,  cup coconut milk beverage, and  tsp. raw honey; stir to blend. Top each jar with 1 cup chopped mango. Seal jars and place in refrigerator.4. Next, make the Overnight Oats. Remove the lids from two mason jars. In each, place  cup old fashioned rolled oats,  cup unsweetened almond milk, and 1 Tbsp. hemp seeds (or sunflower seeds); stir to blend. Top each jar with 1 cup chopped strawberries. Seal jars and place in refrigerator.5. Pre-portioned smoothie bags make it even faster to make your Shakeology smoothie. Fill three plastic bags or other containers each with 1 cup baby spinach and 1 cup frozen blueberries. Place in freezer. Fill two plastic bags or other containers each with 1 cup frozen peaches. Place in freezer.6. Make the Greek Chicken Salads. Place 1 cup chopped romaine lettuce into each of two food containers. Top with  cup chopped cucumber,  cup cherry tomatoes, 5 kalamata olives, and 1 oz. crumbled feta cheese. If you bought rotisserie chicken, cut the breast meat away from the bone and remove the skin. Slice each chicken breast and place 3 oz. of meat in each food container. Cut a lemon in half and place one wedge in each container; use it to dress the salad when youre ready to eat. Place salads in refrigerator.7. To make the White Bean and Tuna Salads, fill three food storage containers each with 1 cup spinach,  cup chopped red bell pepper,  cup chopped cucumber, 1 sliced green onion, and parsley to taste. Place in refrigerator. When ready to eat, open and drain one can of tuna; add tuna to the salad. Dress with 2 tsp. olive oil and 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar just before serving.8. Divide 1 cups low-fat Greek yogurt between two small food containers. Top each with 1 cup fresh berries. Place in refrigerator.9. In a large bowl, combine  cup chopped orange pepper,  cup chopped yellow bell pepper, 1  cups cherry tomatoes,  cup brown rice,  cup canned black beans (drained and rinsed),  cup shredded cheddar cheese, and  cup cilantro (optional). Mix well. Divide evenly between three food storage containers. Place in refrigerator.10. Divide 18 oz. low-fat cottage cheese between three food storage containers. Top each with  tsp. smoked paprika (or chili powder) and 1 Tbsp. raw pepitas. Place in refrigerator. Serve with black beans and rice.11. Last, make the Shrimp and Veggie Rice Bowls. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup broccoli chopped into -inch pieces, 1 cup snow peas (or green beans) chopped into -inch pieces, 1 sliced green onion, 4 tsp. sesame oil, and 2 tsp. rice vinegar. Mix well. Divide evenly between two food storage containers. Top each with 4 oz. cooked shrimp and  sliced Fresno chili (optional). Place in refrigerator. When ready to eat, place a wet paper towel over the container and microwave for two minutes.Save"

6 Easy, Healthy Snack Picks for Kids
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/6-easy-healthy-snack-picks-for-kids,"Lets face it kids can have some pretty inconsistent eating habits. There are days when all they do is pick at their food, and sometimes they just skip meals altogether. Thats where healthy snacks can come in. They can be used to sneak essential nutrients into the diets of growing kids, and can be an energy boost to help children get through their active days.Think of snack time as a mini-meal. Serve whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains instead of processed options that can be loaded with sugar, salt, and saturated fats. Need some inspiration? We think your little ones will love these sweet and savory picks.Greek YogurtAvoid sugary yogurt snacks and choose plain Greek yogurt as a healthier option. Four ounces makes for a light snack, delivers over 10 grams of protein, as well as calcium and vitamin D, which kids need to build strong and healthy bones.You can also add your own fresh fruit and spices, like apples and cinnamon, to amp up flavor without adding sugar. Stonyfield Organic has a great whole-milk variety for little ones and a non-fat version for everyone else in your family.Veggies and HummusIf you havent tried hummus, youre missing out on a creamy snack that can be served in a variety of ways. Made from chickpeas, this nutrient-rich dip is a good source of complex carbs and is low on the glycemic index like other legumes.Dish out two tablespoons of hummus (Sabra Classic Hummus is a favorite), and serve with veggies like baby carrots and bell pepper slices for a quick and easy kid-sized snack. For something more substantial, hummus also works as a tasty spread on sandwiches. Heres a recipe to make your own homemade hummus in less than five minutes.Whole Wheat Crackers or Fruits and Veggies with All-Natural Nut ButterThe combination of peanut butter and crackers is timeless, but it might be time for a makeover. Move away from nut butter brands that contain hydrogenated oil, and opt for all-natural peanut butter or almond butter like Justins Classic Almond Butter which has no added salt or sugar.You also may want to try sunflower butter. A two tablespoon serving of SunButter has the same amount of protein as peanut butter, but contains more Vitamin E, and has four grams of fiber.Instead of processed, salty crackers like saltines, opt for apples, celery, or whole-grain crackers. Crunchmaster 7 Ancient Grains crackers are a good choice, as theyre made from wholesome ingredients like brown rice flour and millet.Beef JerkyForget the gas station meat sticks that you may have gnawed on as a kid and embrace quality brands like Brooklyn Biltong or Nicks Traditional Beef Jerky. This mess-free snack is easy to take on-the-go and can be a great way to sneak more protein in your little ones diet. For younger kids, break the jerky up into smaller pieces that are easier for them to chew.Just make sure you pay attention to the sodium content. The sodium recommendation for children ages one to three years old is 1,000 mg a day, four to eight years old is 1,200 mg a day, and kids ages nine and older is 1,500 mg a day. If you want to give your child a high-protein snack without worrying about the sodium content, another mess-free snack are hard-boiled eggs.Chia Seed SnacksAre chia seeds one of your go-to superfoods? Theyre a great option for children, too. Growing kids need essential fatty acids, like the omega-3s found in chia seeds. These tiny seeds make for a simple, nutrient-dense addition to homemade smoothies, oatmeal, and baked goods, like these raspberry muffins.They might also like chia pudding and can be modified to include your little ones favorite fruits and flavors. Here are six tasty chia pudding recipes to get you started. Take 10 minutes to put it together in the morning and itll have transformed into a pudding when its time for dessert.EdamameYou might only think of edamame as a salad topping or a pre-sushi appetizer, but its also an effortless snack. Its a breeze to prepare (gently boil and sprinkle with a little sea salt), and popping the little beans out of their shells is fun for kids and keeps them occupied  a win-win!Half a cup of cooked edamame is packed with about 9 grams of plant-based protein and 3 grams of satisfying fiber. Find them in the frozen section in most grocery stores, or the more budget-friendly option, 365 by Whole Foods."

Easy Tips and Neck Stretches for Neck Pain
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/easy-tips-and-neck-stretches-for-neck-pain,"At some point in your life, youre likely to suffer from a stiff neck. Necks are high maintenance because they contain so many muscles and joints, have a large range of motion and contain the nerves that run between your brain and your arms, legs, and organs.Whether you tweaked it by sleeping in a less-than-ideal position, or you spent too many hours hunched over your computer, or if its just the result of stress, neck pain will usually resolve within a few days to a week, says Armin Tehrany, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon and founder of Manhattan Orthopedic Care. If its getting worse or if you have weakness or tingling, pain, burning or numbness radiating down your arms, see a doctor.In the meantime, these tips may provide some relief if youve got a stiff neck. No twinge? Save them for the next time youre feeling achy:1. Opt for heat. If your neck feels sore, tight or stiff, apply a heating pad for 10-15 minutes. You want to use heat for sore muscles, especially in the morning because youve usually slept with your neck in the same position for eight hours, says Tehrany. (If youve had the air conditioner running all night, heat can be especially helpful to your neck muscles the next morning.)2. Set a timer. If youre sitting all day at a desk or in front of a computer, Tehrany suggests taking hourly stretch breaks (and while youre at it, walk around for five minutes too). Then stretch: Gently lower your ear to one shoulder for 15 to 30 seconds, and then repeat it and bring your chin to your chest, to the other side, and then to the back. Complete two to four circles in each direction.3. Tighten your midsection. A strong core is the best prevention for neck pain, says Tehrany. Surprisingly, weak torso muscles contribute to that office slouch. When your chest caves in and your back rounds, your neck and head tilt back  putting extra strain on the muscles along your spine and over-stretching the muscles along the front of the neck. A simple plank is a good way to boost core strength without any fancy equipment.4. Put your finger on it. A research review published in the journal PLoS One found that acupressure (massaging traditional acupuncture points) is helpful in treating chronic neck pain. Try these points to ease tension: Press the thumb of your right hand on the webbing between your left thumb and index finger and put your right index finger underneath to squeeze the muscles. You should feel an achy sensation. Hold for 30 seconds then repeat on the other side. Next, place your fingers of both hands on either side of your spine at the base of your skull. Slide them out to the side about an inch (you should feel them fall into a trough as you drop off the muscle). Press deeply here and hold for 30 seconds.You can do these neck stretches discreetly at your desk!5. Do a posture scan. When youre standing upright, you should be able to draw a straight line from your ear down through your shoulder, hip, and ankle. You may need to roll your shoulders back and down, draw your navel in toward your spine, tighten your glutes, and position your head back to get into the proper position. However, neck pain can be caused by muscle imbalances in the lower body too. A qualified personal trainer or physical therapist can check your posture to identify potential issues.6. Go hands-free already. Its 2016. Theresno reason to still be cradling your phone between your ear and shoulder, which can put a serious kink in your neck. Invest in a headset if you use a landline phone or pick up some earphones with a microphone for your cell. Unless you want to be know as the person who uses speakerphone at the office (hint: you dont).7. Get out the foam roller. When you have a stiff neck, youll often also feel tightness in your upper and middle back. Try this move daily to counteract slouching and improve mobility in your thoracic spine (the area between your neck and low back). Place a foam roller on the floor and sit with knees bent and hands lightly against the sides of your head, elbows forward. Lie back onto the roller so its centeredacross the bottom of your shoulder blades. Stay here and breathe deeply for 60-90 seconds as you slowly extend over the roller. Next, lift your hips and scan for tender spots, and repeat, breathing into the discomfort.8. Take it easy in yoga. All that stretching is great for your body and mind, but some poses require you to turn your neck or lift your head to extreme degrees, which can trigger pain and even (in rare cases) increase your risk of stroke. Always wait until youre adequately warmed up before moving into any extreme ranges of motion. If a pose hurts or feels challenging for your neck, ease off. Nobody will kick you out of class if you dont look up at the ceiling in trikonasana (or triangle pose, see the neck angle). See yoga pose above.9. Use your noggin. Sometimes a massage is worth it: A study in the Clinical Journal of Pain showed that almost 80 percent of people with chronic neck pain who tried craniosacral therapy, a type of manual therapy that focuses primarily on the head and spine, saw a 50 percent reduction in neck pain after 8 weeks.Maybe its time to baby your neck a little. How often do you get a stiff neck?"

13 Flavorful Chicken Recipes Under 300 Calories
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/13-flavorful-chicken-recipes-under-300-calories,"We will refrain from the cheesy winner, winner chicken dinner reference (or oops), but seriously: You will win at healthy meal prep when you make any or all of these chicken recipes.If you need some convincing, flip your thinking about lean chicken breasts as boring, bland, and dry, and consider them high-protein vessels that allow the other flavors of a dish to shine. If you use the right ingredients, you can transform poultry into something you might even start craving.Mexican Chicken Zucchini BoatsThese boats are a healthier spin on chicken burritos, swapping in nutritious zucchini for flour tortillas. A typicalflour tortillacontains 25 grams of carbohydrates, 458 milligrams of sodium, and not much else. One zucchini contains 10 grams of carbs, 26 milligrams of sodium, as well as vitamins A, C, and K, and minerals like calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Using zucchini as the vessel is also convenient way to watch your portions without having to think too hard: 1 boat = 1 serving.What youll need:4 large zucchini, cut in half lengthwise4 tsp. olive oil, divided use1 medium onion, finely chopped2 cloves garlic, finely chopped1 cup tomato sauce, no sugar added2 Tbsp. tomato paste, no sugar added1 Tbsp. ground chili powder (or 1 tsp. chili powder and 1 tsp. ancho chili powder)1 tsp. ground cumin tsp. ground paprika3 cups shredded cooked chicken breast1 cups corn kernels1 cup shredded cheddar (or Monterey jack) cheese2 Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro1 medium tomato, chopped2 green onions, thinly slicedFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 239Marinated Summer Veggies with Chicken SausageIn this flavor-rich dish, colorful summer veggies like zucchini, squash, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, and green beans soak in a tart marinade; chicken sausage adds a boost of protein. Just make sure to use an all-natural chicken sausage to avoid preservatives and keep the sodium low.The best part? No Top Chef skills needed here  chop, marinate, and cook. Thats it. And if you dont want to broil it (and yourself) in a hot kitchen, you can throw it all on a sheet pan and cook it on the grill  no muss, no fuss.What youll need:2 tsp. olive oil2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice2 cloves garlic, choppedSea salt (or Himalayan salt) and ground black pepper (to taste; optional)1 lb. green beans, ends removed2 medium zucchini, sliced2 medium summer (crookneck) squash, sliced1 cup halved cherry tomatoes1 medium green bell pepper, sliced1 medium red onion, sliced4 cooked chicken sausages, sliced2 Tbsp. chopped fresh basilFind out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 273Lemon Garlic Chicken ThighsUnder 300 calories? Try this zippy, moist chicken thats under 200 calories. Granted, this only includes the chicken and not any sides, but you can top a salad or a bowl of zoodles with this light and lovely protein. The sweet and savory flavors of the marinade  you get a fresh, acidic bite from lemon juice, savory complexity from Worcestershire sauce, and a touch of sweet from raw honey  make it unnecessary to dress accompanying vegetables with much more than a bit of balsamic and extra virgin olive oil.What youll need: cup fresh lemon juice cup raw honey (or pure maple syrup)1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce6 cloves garlic, finely chopped2 lbs. raw chicken thighs, boneless, skinless (about 8 thighs)Nonstick cooking spray tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt) tsp. ground black pepperLemon wedges (for garnish; optional)Fresh parsley sprigs (for garnish; optional)Find out how to make the recipe.Calories per serving: 177Chicken and White Bean ChiliThis craveable chili recipe is lighter than traditional chili, and not just in color.

Why ‘Clean Eating’ Isn’t The Same as Educated Eating
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/why-clean-eating-isnt-the-same-as-educated-eating,"Instagram users upload 80 million photos on a given day. Granted, many of them are blurry selfies, memes, baby pics, and landscape shots, 99 percent of which have been mutilated by a gross misunderstanding of filter etiquette.But a bundle of those 80M is also of food: colorful salads that overflow the plate, mason jars filled with overnight oats, protein muffins, tender steaks, the freshest green juices to ever pour from a Vitamix, and so on.The ubiquitous hashtag they use? #cleaneating. But, what is clean eating? A fad? A lifestyle? A hashtag to get more people to see your photos?Thats a good question, says Denis Faye, Beachbodys senior director of nutrition content. In my opinion, clean eating should be shorthand for eat lots of fruits and vegetables and less processed food.Unfortunately, its getting a bit overused as a cleanse type of thing, as in, I need some cleaning eating now I think you should be eating clean all of the time. Itd be pretty neat if the buzzword was educated eating.So What Exactly Is Clean Eating?With all the buzzwords out there, Fayes desire for more education could certainly come in handy. A 2014 study published in the journal Food Studies found that buzzwords on packaging i.e. organic, antioxidants and all natural  proved confusing to a 318-person test pool.How confusing? The group rated every product that featured a buzzword healthier than the same product without the word on the label. You know, because antioxidant-rich soda is, like, way better for you than normal, rot-your-teeth soda that is void of antioxidant benefits.The basic tenets of eating healthy (or would it be eating clean, or clean eating  see how confusing it is!) havent changed in about a zillion years: Consume fewer processed and fried foods, and eat more fruits and veggies.Those are two pretty important rules I think everyone should follow, says Faye.Also, munching on too many clean foods can still lead to weight gain. Portion control and keeping macros in line with fitness goals is still important.When I was a kid, I was really unhealthy and fat, says Faye. We had a salad bar at my school, so my [lunch] every day would be iceberg lettuce, ham, and peanuts, and Id drown the whole thing in Thousand Island dressing. I was so ignorant about food that I assumed that was healthy.Some food and health writers have hypothesized that the term clean eating has evolved into an elitist way of shaming folks who cant afford to shop at Whole Foods or dont have a farmers market near their home.When I give people a diet, I do it with the understanding that Im giving them a baseline, Faye explains. If I go where people are struggling economically, I wont start to lecture them on organics  thats absurd.But, what transcends economics for the majority is the lack of understanding about what is and isnt healthy when it comes to food. Some simplification might be in order: Eat as many whole foods as close to their natural state as possible that you can afford. And pass that message along. #educatedeating"

How to Meal Prep When You Travel
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-meal-prep-when-you-travel,"The last time I flew the friendly skies, the in-flight snacks were about as far from healthy as they could be. Shortly after take-off, the flight attendant handed me a box containing a puff pastry stuffedwith cheese and tomato sauce, and a bright pink, raspberry-flavored cake. A few hours later, he returned with paper cups filled with chocolate ice cream. I kid you not ice cream has replaced peanuts on some airplanes. When I was younger, I might have thought this was the coolest airline ever. But asa person who now tries to steer clear of sugar and processed foods, I was woefully out of my comfort zone  and I was hungry.How had I neglected to follow theadvice I so often give to others, and left home without bringing anything healthy to eat with me? I resolved then and there to never again get stuck in an airport or on a planewithout a sandwich, or at least a few protein-rich snacks in my bag.Road trips pose a similar problem. It can be just as challenging to find a healthy meal near a highway stop. Heck, even the supposedly healthy options at fast food restaurantscan have as many calories as the burgers and fries.When peopletravel, theyput a lot of thought into what to pack in theirsuitcases but hardly any about what theyll eat. The next time you travel or hit the road,dont forget to pack some healthy snacks. Those especiallydedicated to meal prep might evenprepare afew balanced meals, and carry them in an insulated bag.TSA allows most foods to pass through security (read their rules here). Liquids, like peanut butter or salad dressing, need to be in containers and weigh less than three ounces. For road trips, foods that can be eaten with your hands and wont make a mess in the car are best. Get more ideas for great road trip snacks here.Check out these great ideas for travel meal prep to fuel your next adventure.Plan ahead for the whole familyNow THIS is how to pack for a family road trip! @wholefoodnanny fed her family three meals and plenty of snacks during a 25-hour drive across the country, and bragged that they never had to stop for fast food. Purchasing healthy, prepared snacks and whole fruit gave her extra time to make homemade Energy Balls and Ranch Dressing. This kind of prep takes a bit of planning, but the effort pays off!Choose foods to mix and matchMeals on the road are notorious diet-wreckers, bur not for @meowmeix. Her simple meal prep covered all of the bases to help keep her on track with her nutrition plan. She packed breakfast, snacks, lean protein, and cut vegetables that she could munch as snacks or mix together for a meal. She brought unsweetened instant oatmeal, sliced cucumbers, baked sweet potatoes, shredded chicken, bell peppers, baby carrots, a whole lot of mixed nuts (we hope she was sharing!), and travel packets of Beachbody Performance Recover to refuel after her workouts.Keep perishable foodscool@chiris_roccio_fit said, Traveling doesnt have to mess with your meal-prep game. You just gotta have the right tools for the job. For Chris, one of those tools is his extra-large insulated lunch bag. He packed it with an impressive array of meals, snacks, and Beachbody Performance supplements for his trip to Beachbody Coach Summit. He included a few balanced meals of chicken, veggies, and carbs, plus lots of extra protein in the form of hardboiled eggs and tins of wild-caught sardines.Stick to finger foodsBring snacks that you can eat with your hands that wont make a mess in your car or drip onto you lap.

We like her perfectly-sized container to keep her sammy from getting squished.If all else fails, take protein!An in-flight snackcan be as easy as this chicken and cucumber combo from@allisonliveswell. Shes got protein and fiber (and a good book) to keep her satisfied until she lands.Snack packs to the rescueTravel can be stressful. Packing travel snacks doesnt have to be. When youve got a dozen last-minute priorities to take care of before you catch an Uber to the airport, slicing vegetables and hard-boiling eggs arent on the list. Skip the time in the kitchen and stash a selection of pre-packaged healthy snacks like jerky, freeze-dried fruit, and packets of almond butter into your carry-on like @jessicabootsy.Dont forget to hydrateAirplanes have lower humidity levels than the Sahara Desert, and you wouldnt travel there without water, would you? Avoid the sticker shock of the bottled water for sale past the TSA checkpoint by bringing an empty canteen and filling it at a drinking fountain at the departure gate. Extra points if you follow @the_smallseeds lead and add fresh herbs or slices of fruit to flavor your beverage container.Just add waterIf tea is your, uh, cup of tea, make sure to stasha few sachets for your trip.

Is Sugar Really That Bad for You?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-sugar-really-that-bad-for-you,"Sugar. Its been tied to diabetes, obesity, hyperactivity, and dental cavities. Its sweet and crave-worthy, and (too often) added to processed foods to improve taste, texture, and shelf life. Sugar is in everything from tomato sauce to salad dressings to organic all natural baby foods. We cant escape it, and, generally, were eating far too much of it.On average, Americans consume more than 300 calories per day of added sugar  thats 82 grams or 19.5 teaspoons  and teens are consuming much more, a whopping 28+ teaspoons!How Much Sugar Is OK?The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends free sugar (sugars added by the manufacturer, cook, consumer, as well as other concentrated sugar sources like agave, honey, and fruit juice) intake to be less than 10 percent of total daily calories. On a 2,000-calorie diet, that would mean consuming less than 200 calories, or 50 grams per day of free sugar.The WHO also suggests that there is convincing evidence to further reduce free sugar intake to less than five percent of total calories per day (100 calories, or 25 grams of free sugar on a 2,000-calorie diet). In real-life equivalents, five percent is about the amount of free sugar found in one cup of sweetened Greek yogurt.The American Heart Association has similar recommendations for added sugar. Their limit per day is no more than 100 calories of free sugar for women and 150 calories for men.These recommendations do not refer to the naturally occurring sugars found in whole fruits, vegetables, and unsweetened dairy. One of the big differences between added sugars (think: granulated sugar or high fructose corn syrup) and natural sugars (think: fructose, or the sugar found in fruit) is added sugars lack nutritional value. Sure, certain processed foods that contain added sugars can be fortified with vitamins, minerals, and even fiber, but they dont have naturally-occurring phytonutrients and antioxidants that natural sources of sugar, like strawberries, do. Theyre just empty calories.Read more: Should You Avoid Fruit Because of Its Sugar Content?Where Sugar HidesThe current Nutrition Facts Label doesnt differentiate between natural and added sugars, making it a challenge to know how much added sugar you are actually consuming. The new changes to the label will include separate lines for amount of total sugars and added sugars. These changes will provide more transparency in labeling and hopefully encourage food companies to reduce the added sugars in their products.Until then, the only way to know if added sugars are in the food you are consuming is to read the ingredients list. Ingredients on the label are listed in greatest to least amount, but manufacturers are getting sneaky by using multiple sources of sugar so that a singular source doesnt appear high on the list.To spot sugar in the line up, check for words like:fruit juice concentratefruit juicecane juiceturbinadoinvert sugarbeet sugarmalt syrupcorn syrup solidsdextrinwords that end in ose like maltose, dextrose, fructose, glucoseRemember, added sugars are added sugars, no matter what lingo they are disguised under.Ways to Slash SugarIf youre trying to eat better, improve fitness, manage or reduce the risk of disease, and/or lose weight, the best advice is to reduce added sugar consumption, including those more natural yet still concentrated sugar sources like agave, honey, and fruit juice.Keep your added sugar intake in check by eating a variety of foods in their natural state, i.e. fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, whole grains that you cook yourself, lean proteins without sauces and marinades, and unsweetened dairy. Read ingredient labels. To cut out added sugar in a healthy way, assess your current sugar situation, and make moderate changes to progress toward your sugar goal. Drastic measures can lead to dieting, extreme or ridged thinking, and obsessive behavior, which is not the desired result.Yes, you can still have your cake and eat it too, but eat your fruits and veggies most often. Moderation is king; sugar is not the demon its the amount of sugar that makes the difference."

Watermelon Fruit Pizza

Theyre made of juicy, delicious fruits layered on top of Greek yogurt and luscious watermelon slices. Theyre almost too pretty to eat! But lets be real, no food is ever that pretty.Lets talk about watermelon for a second. Its refreshing, sweet, and delicious, but watermelons are usually enormous (unless theyre baby watermelons, which are adorable), which means you can provide snacks for a whole party with just one. Watermelon is in season year-round, and U.S. harvests are available between April and November and it can be chopped into cubes, muddled into a slush, sliced into triangles, or even carved into sharks  perfect for a fruity spin on pizza.For this Watermelon Pizza, Greek yogurt acts as the sauce, adds a teeny burst of protein, and works as a tart and creamy contrast to the fruit. Without it, this recipe would essentially be a stacked fruit salad, and lets be honestthat also sounds pretty tasty. Finally, we topped the pizza with blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and kiwi. Talk about a brilliant flavor profile. The toppings add a powerful punch of antioxidants and bold, bright flavors  the pepperoni to the crust, if you will and kiwifruit orbs boast a level of tang that cant be found in other fresh produce and packed with vitamin C and fiber, making them the cherry (or kiwi) on top of this recipe.Watermelon Fruit PizzaTotal Time: 10 min.Prep Time: 10 min.Cooking Time: NoneYield: 4 servingsIngredients1-inch thick slice fresh watermelon, cut into 4 wedges (quarters)4 Tbsp. reduced fat (2%) plain Greek yogurt4 medium strawberries, sliced2 Tbsp. fresh blueberries cup fresh blackberries1 kiwi fruit, cut into 4 slices4 fresh mint leavesPreparation1.

Buffet Style Meal Prep with Shredded Chicken, Roasted Veggies, and More
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/buffet-style-meal-prep-with-shredded-chicken-roasted-veggies-and-more,"The weather is warm, the sun is shining, and the last thing anyone wants to do is spend time in a hot, stuffy kitchen. But unless you have the willpower of Chris Hemsworth training to be Thor, it might be hard to avoid summertime temptations like hot dogs, potato salad, and ribs. Meal prep can help. By arming yourself with healthy food for the whole week, its easy to stay on track with your nutrition goals.And healthy food doesnt have to take a long time to make! Our resident meal prep master, Social Media Manager Amanda Meixner, is a pro at coming up with yummymenus that follow the Portion Fix container system. Her schedule is packed with yoga teacher training and doing weekend workouts at the beach, and she doesnt always want to spend her Sunday afternoons creating elaborate meal preps. But instead of skipping it, she just simplifies it.This week, she made overnight oats with Shakeology for breakfast, and added in a different fruit each day. For lunch and dinner, she prepared roasted vegetables, shredded chicken, hard boiled eggs, and quinoa for a buffet-style meal prep fit for a queen. Throughout the week, she mixed and matched the already prepared food for quick and easy meals. Take a look below to see how Amanda combined the food to make healthy, well rounded meals. She eats at the 1,5001,800 calorie level, but, depending on your goals, you might need to eat more or less food. Follow your portion plan to map out how you should fill your plate. A good rule of thumb for each meal is to have at least two Green containers, one to two Red containers, and one to two Yellow containers.Here is what Amandas buffet-style meal prep looks like this week:Heres what Amanda iseating:ProteinsShredded chickenHard-boiled eggsShakeologyVegetablesRaw baby carrotsCucumber and bell pepper saladCeleryRoasted cauliflowerRoasted broccoli and mushroomsSauted red cabbageMixed greensFruits (not shown)BananasApplesCarbsQuinoaBaked sweet potatoesOatmealHealthy fats (not shown)Almond butteravocadosSeeds/OilsBalsamic vinaigrette dressingOlive oilSesame oilSeasoningsLow-sodium chicken brothDrinks (optional)Kombucha (8 ounces count as 1 Yellow on 21 Day Fix)With buffet-style meal prep, every meal can have variety. Mix and match the foods you want, when you want them. Heres how Amanda combined these prepared foods into two different lunches:Meal 1:  cup shredded chicken, 1 cup cauliflower,  cup broccoli and mushrooms,  cup cabbage, 1 large sweet potato (Portion Fix containers: 2+ Green, 1 Red, 2 Yellow, 1 tsp.)Meal 2:  cup shredded chicken,  cup broccoli and mushrooms,  cup cabbage,  cup cucumber,  cup bell pepper,  cup quinoa (Portion Fix containers = 2+ Green, 1 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 tsp.)Follow these simple steps to make Amandas buffet-style meal prep:1.First, bake the sweet potatoes. Preheat your oven to 375F. Scrub four sweet potatoes to clean them, then place on a large baking sheet. Cook the sweet potatoes for about 35 to 40 minutes, or until they pierce easily with a fork. When cool, place sweet potatoes in the refrigerator.2.Next, roast the cauliflower, broccoli, and mushrooms. Turn your oven up to 450F. On a large baking sheet, add10 ouncessliced mushrooms and12 ounces chopped broccoli. On another baking sheet, add12 ounces chopped cauliflower. Drizzle with two teaspoons olive oil, and place in oven for about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let them cool.3.Chop half a head of red cabbage. In a medium pan, heattwo teaspoons olive oil. Add the chopped cabbage and cook for approximately10minutes, or until soft.4.Place eight eggs in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.5. A rice cooker will make quick work of cooking the quinoa, and will shut off automatically when its done. If you do not have a rice cooker, it can be cooked on a stovetop. Cook one cup of quinoa in two cups water and then set aside to cool.6.To make the chicken, place a 16-ounce chicken breast into a pan with one cup low-sodium chicken broth (just enough to cover the chicken). Add two teaspoons of olive oil and desired seasonings. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 1520 minutes. Cover and turn heat down to low. Continue to cook for another 4575 minutes or until chicken shreds when you use a fork. Use two forks to pull the chicken apart. Its easier to shred the chicken while its still warm.7.Prepare the oatmeal jars. Set out five pint-sized mason jars. To each, add  cup oats, one scoop Shakeology, 1 cup fruit, and water to mix. Cover and place in refrigerator.8.Slice two cucumbers and two bell peppers. Drizzle with 1or 2teaspoons balsamic vinegar or sesame oil, mix, and refrigerate.9.Cut a stalk of celery into smaller pieces and put into a container."

Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Pesto
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/quinoa-with-sun-dried-tomatoes-and-pesto-recipe,"Theres no sauce more versatile and satisfying than pesto. You can serve it hot and poured over pasta, cold and spread on a sandwich, or tossed with quinoa and sun-dried tomatoes, like in this beautiful recipe weve whipped up for you.Pesto and sun-dried tomatoes are meant for each other. A match made in zesty, earthy heaven. So lets talk about sun-dried tomatoes for a second. These tiny morsels of giant flavor were originally created out of utility. Centuries ago, Italian farmers gave their harvests a longer shelf life by salting and evaporating tomatoes, allowing the community to reap their nutritional benefits year-round. Tomatoes are known for being high in the antioxidant lycopene, which is responsible for their red hue and disease-preventing properties. Surprisingly, sun-dried tomatoes are actually higher in lycopene than their fresh counterparts, making them as healthful as they are flavorful. Also, I may have eaten them straight out of the bag once or twice or yesterday. I think the farmers of yesteryear would be proud.But back to pesto; this recipe keeps tradition with basil, extra virgin olive oil, and garlic, but turns up the nourishment with nutritional yeast and hemp seeds instead of the customary pine nut. Hemp seeds are packed with omega fatty acids, fiber, and protein. And to address what were all thinking, the only high youll get from hemp seeds is a nutritional one.Finally, the all-powerful superfood, quinoa. Its no longer a new, mysterious seed (the part we actually eat is the seed) only enjoyed by hippies. Americans have welcomed it as an acceptable alternative to rice, which is great news due to its excellent health benefits. Higher in protein than brown rice, and brimming with essential amino acids, quinoa is always a terrific choice. Plus, it cooks much faster than rice.This recipe for Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Pesto is basically a bowl of superfood that tastes incredible. Its perfect for a potluck, or made ahead and taken to the office for lunch.Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and PestoTotal Time: 50 min.Prep Time: 20 min.Cooking Time: NoneYield: 8 servings, about  cup eachIngredients cup sun-dried tomatoesHot water1 cup packed fresh basil leaves cup hemp seeds (or coarsely chopped walnuts)2 cloves garlic, chopped tsp. nutritional yeast tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt) tsp. ground black pepper1 Tbsp. water2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil4 cups cooked quinoa2 cups fresh baby spinach1.

Returning to Exercise After Pregnancy
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/returning-to-exercise-after-pregnancy,"ByJenileeMatzYes, you can get your body back after pregnancy. Our experts claim that giving birth is like running a very hilly marathon. Theyre both grueling endurance events with a sweet prize at the finish line  whether thats a gold medal, a personal best, or even better, a brand-new baby. Another factor these physical activities have in common: Your body will be exhausted and worn out afterward, and you may need to take it slowly until you receive the all clear from your health practitioner.Like after any intense endurance race, your muscles, hips, and internal organs will need some time to recover. That said, its not long before many new moms start wondering when and how they can return to exercise aftergiving birth.According to Nicole Dorsey, M.S., a Los Angeles-based exercise physiologist who specializes in pregnancy and exercise, picking up your pre-baby activity level slowly (but soon) is a must, as long as your health practitioner gives the OK. Not only will your heroic return to exercise aid in shedding the baby weight, butconsistent exerciseboasts a ton of other health benefits for new moms.Dorsey, who teaches postnatal fitness classes, says, Being active again can boost your energy, restore muscle tone, condition theabdominal muscles,prevent lower back pain, and help stave off postpartum depression.How to get yourbody back after pregnancyAccording to theAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecology(ACOG), exactly when you can return to exercise postpartum depends on the type of childbirth you had. In the past, the rule of thumb was to wait six weeks before you started a fitness routine. However, ACOG now says that if you had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, its normally fine to startgently exercisinga few days after your baby is born, or whenever you feel ready. If you delivered by cesarean section, ask your doctor when its safe for you to exercise. A C-section makes things tougher but not impossible, says Dorsey.Tune into your body before jumping back inReturning to fitness after having a baby can be nerve-racking. Theres nothing to feel bad about if you take it slow and tune into your body  you know your strengths and physical weaknesses probably better than anyone else, including your gyno, insists Dorsey. But she notes, Yourreturn to exerciseis normally easier if you were moderately fit and strong during your pregnancy, if you had a natural delivery, and if you maintained a moderate exercise program throughout.These six simple tips can help keep you safe and motivated as youreturn to a more active lifestyle with baby:1. Ease into it. Return to exercise slowly. Try 10 minutes at a time, then 15, 20, etc. Gradually increase the intensity and length of your sweat sessions, slowly add resistance to a bike, or incrementally increase the incline if youre working out on the treadmill. (Be reasonable, says Dorsey. Dont initiate a new sport or return to barrel racing or bungee jumping within the first few weeks after having a baby! Be good to yourself and use common sense.)2. Vary your routine.Switching up your workouts can help you stick with it. Dorsey suggests starting with long walks and postnatal Pilates classes, Beachbody On Demand, or DVDs. She also stresses that strength training is extra important fornew moms. Youll be constantly holding, nursing, and carrying your baby for the next few months, Dorsey says. Most new mothers suffer from stiff necks, weak arms, and very poor posture. But regular strength training and other resistance exercises can counter these effects.3. Include your baby.Dont wait until you have childcare to exercise. Rather, pick a workout your baby can be part of. Include your baby by pushing your little one in a stroller, or putting her next to you while you stretch or perform core work.4. Grab a postnatal friend.Workout buddies are key for accountability. Knowing you have someone counting on you will make you less likely to skip your fitness session. Also, be sure to warm up thoroughly and cool down after every single workout.5. Drink up.Drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after exercise to stay hydrated, especially if youre breastfeeding; your body and your baby both desperately need the added healthy hydration.6. Be prepared if youre breastfeeding.According to the Mayo Clinic, some studies have indicatedthat intense exercise (marathoners were tested) can cause lactic acid to build up in breastmilk. This wont harm your baby, but it may cause the taste of your breastmilk to be unpleasant. However, many breastfeeding moms do triathlons and marathons without having their babies refuse their milk, so dont go looking for trouble!Nursing moms should also wear supportive bras and time their feedings with workout sessions. The Mayo Clinic suggests tryingto feed your baby or use a breast pump right before exercising so your body is more comfortable (your breasts will not be so likely to leak) and your mind is more at ease.Most importantly, have patience, and be lenient with yourself. You just ran the most grueling marathon of your life! Not only are you recovering from childbirth, but youre also dealing with sleep deprivation, changing hormones, and the demands of caring for a newborn. Its OK if you need to take an extra rest day orcut a workout short.Remember that some exercise is always better than none, and even 10 minutes of moving that beautiful,new body around almost instantly improves the moods of mothers everywhere."

No-Cook Meal Prep for the 1,200–1,500 Calorie Level
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/no-cook-meal-prep-for-the-1200-1500-calorie-level,"With temperatures breaching the 100s in Los Angeles this past weekend, the last thing I wanted to do was turn on my stove or oven. But Sunday night was fast approaching, and I knew I would regret skipping my meal prep for the week if I didnt get my act together. Thats when I had the brilliant idea of doing a no-cook meal prep.Weve featured a no-cook meal prep before, so I knew it was possible to create a weeks worth of healthy meals without heating up the kitchen. I modified the menu to 1,2001,500 calories and drafted my grocery list. Then, with a small army of fans at my side (my apartment doesnt have central air conditioning), I set up shop in the kitchen to prep for the week to come.Though moving at all was enough to make me sweat, the no-cook meal prep plan allowed me to assemble healthy meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients in record time. Juicy berries in an oatmeal jar for breakfast, crunchy tuna lettuce cups for lunch, savory Asian chicken wraps for dinnerAlthough the chilled meals were a delight to eat in the middle of June, I did have one warm dish; I popped a frozen veggie patty into the microwave (I hate to break it to you, but this doesnt really count as cooking).This meal prep is ideal for a summer heat wave, or if cooking isnt one of your strengths, or if you dont have a lot of time to spend on meal prep.Follow this guide to make your own no-cook meal prep, complete with step-by-step instructions and a grocery list. Its made for the 1,2001,500 calorie range.Heres what your meal plan for the week will look like when youre done.This Weeks Meal Prep MenuBreakfast: Overnight Oats with Greek Yogurt and BerriesLunch (M/W/F): Tuna Nioise Lettuce CupsLunch (T/Th): Roast Beef SaladSnack (M/W/F): Shakeology, frozen fruit, and unsweetened coconutSnack (T/Th): Shakeology, banana, and nut butterDinner (M/W/F): Asian Chicken WrapsDinner (T/Th): Turkey or Veggie Burger with vegetables and hummusBREAKFASTOvernight Oats with Greek Yogurt and Berries( cup oats,  cup Greek yogurt, 1 cup fruit = 1 Yellow, 1 Red, 1 Purple)LUNCHESM/W/F: Tuna Nioise Lettuce Cups(4 lettuce leaves;  cup frozen green beans, thawed;  cup cherry tomatoes; 1 can tuna in water; 5 olives = 2 Green, 1 Red, 1 Orange)T/TH: Roast Beef Salad(1 cup lettuce,  cup cherry tomatoes,  cup shredded carrots, 3 oz. deli roast beef, cup beans of any kind, dressing = 2 Green, 1 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 Orange)SNACKSM/W/F: Shakeologywith 1 cup frozen fruit and 1 Tbsp. unsweetened coconut = 1 Red, 1 Purple,  OrangeT/TH: Shakeologywith  banana and 2 tsp. nut butter = 1 Red, 1 Purple, 2 tsp.DINNERSM/W/F: Asian Chicken Wrap(3 oz. rotisserie chicken breast; 8 raw, unsalted cashews; one 6-inch whole wheat tortilla; 1 cup shredded cabbage, cilantro or parsley; green onion; Peanut Lime Dressing [ cup smooth peanut butter, 2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice, 1 Tbsp. rice vinegar, 2 tsp. finely chopped fresh ginger, 2 tsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce, 2 tsp. raw honey] = 1 Green, 1 Yellow, 1 Red, 1 Blue, 2 tsp.)T/TH: Turkey or veggie burger with vegetables and hummus(1 turkey burger or veggie burger patty [microwave or put in toaster oven to heat], lettuce leaf, tomato slice, mustard,  cup baby carrots or chopped bell peppers,  cup hummus = 1 Red, 1 Green, 1 Blue)Your step-by-step plan to assemble the no-cook meal prep:1.Make the overnight oats.

The Best Sunscreens to Buy in 2016
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/the-best-sunscreens-to-buy-in-2016,"By Marygrace TaylorSummers finally here, and the living sure is easy. Or is it? If youre planning on spending some fun-filled time in the sun, you might be scratching your head trying to find a good sunscreen to toss in your beach bag. What SPF do you really need? Should you use a mineral sunscreen or one made with chemical filters? And will you be happier with a lotion, spray, or stick?Of course, its good that youre thinking about this stuff at all, instead of forgoing sunscreen entirely. Protecting your skin from the suns harmful rays is serious business, not just for guarding against skin cancer but also because the suns rays play a large role in aging the skin. So, its smart to pick a sunscreen you feel good about using every day and then supplement as needed for special situations (playing sports outside, swimming, etc.).Before diving into the best picks for 2016, lets take a moment to point out four key things you should always look for when buying a sunscreen. According to the American Academy of Dermatologists, you should seek out sunscreens that are:SPF 30. Resist the urge to use a lower SPF for the sake of your tan. In order to really protect against skin cancer, your sunscreen needs to be at least SPF 30. (Higher SPFs offer little additional protection, and they dont last any longer.)Broad-spectrum. This means your sunscreen shields against against both UVA rays (which hit the deepest layer of your skin) and UVB rays (which burn the top layers of your skin), giving you the maximum protection against skin cancer and sunburns.Water-resistant. Because even if youre not going swimming, youre probably going to sweat. Water-resistant lotions will protect your skin even if it gets wet.Mineral ingredients. Sunscreens containing chemical filterslike oxybenzone avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate may mimic human hormones and cause skin irritation or allergies, says the Environmental Working Group,. Instead, look for mineral sunscreens with active ingredients like zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. Theyre safer than their chemical filter counterparts, and will do just as good of a job at shielding you from harmful rays.Of course, some sunscreens that meet these criteria are still better than others. (Chalkiness, weird smells, or gunky textures? No thanks.)These EWG-approved sunscreens are clean, effective, and all-around great options.For everyday protectionA solid, all-purpose sunscreen should work for both your body and face, be easy to apply, and fight hard to keep your skin safe all day every day. Kiss My Face Organics Face & Body Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 ($13.99, kissmyface.com) checks all of these boxes, while delivering green tea and sunflower oil for an extra layer of protection. Thanks to the antioxidants and vitamins in these ingredients, theyre a natural source of SPF and also help keep skin moisturized. Prefer a spray? Try Honest Mineral Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 ($13.95, honest.com).For sportsWhen youre active, you need a sunscreen that can keep up with you, no matter how sweaty you get. All Good SPF 33 Sport Sunscreen Lotion ($15.99, amazon.com) is hypoallergenic (meaning its unlikely to cause an allergic reaction), leaves zero white residue, and boasts rejuvenating ingredients like organic green tea, rose hip antioxidants, and organic jojoba oil.For kidsIf youre looking for a lotion, try Belly Buttons & Babies Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 30 ($22, bellybuttonsandbabies.com). Its fragrance-free, so its gentle on your little ones skin. Looking for a kid-friendly stick for easier application? California Baby Everyday/Year-Round Sunscreen Stick, SPF30+ is the sunscreen for you ($26.99 for a two-pack, amazon.com).For when you need a travel-sized optionThe best sunscreen is the one you have on hand at all times and actually use. When youre on the go, try a stick like Badger Unscented Sunscreen Face Stick, SPF 35 ($8.55, amazon.com). Its small size makes it easy to stow anywhere, and its easier to apply than a lotion or spray.For acne-prone skinIf your skin is oily, the last thing you want to do is slather on a greasy sunscreen. Derma e Antioxidant Natural Defense Sunscreen ($15.43, amazon.com) is made just for your faceso its oil-free and wont clog your pores. Plus, its fortified with antioxidants like vitamin C to promote younger-looking skin.Of course, whichever sunscreen you pick, itll only protect you if you use it correctly. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, you should apply sunscreen to dry skin 15 minutes before you go outside, so youre fully protected as soon as you step out into the sun. (You should use a full ounce, or the amount that would fill a shot glass, to cover your entire body.) And set your phone to remind you to reapply every two hours, or do so right after swimming or sweating. Your skin will thank you."

Beachbody Results: Madeline Lost 27 Pounds and Won $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-madeline-lost-27-pounds-and-won-1000,"SharesMadeline Lemay, age 40, lost 27 lbs with 21 Day Fix, PiYo, and The Masters Hammer and Chisel. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?My daughter had just turned three and I realized that I was still a size 12 and I hadnt lost my baby weight. I was looking at pictures of myself from her birthday party and I was not happy. I constantly wore baggy clothes to hide my fat rolls. I would workout like crazy and not lose any weight, and I couldnt figure out what I was doing wrong. I felt frumpy.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I was inspired by a few friends of mine that did yoga. I was amazed at how their bodies moved in certain poses, and I wanted to be them. I wanted to wear fancy leggings and look good in a tank top. The support on Instagram was overwhelming about being comfortable in your own body which made me realize that I was comfortable in my own body. I met someone on there that introduced me to Shakeology and wellness coaching, and it all took off from there.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The program that I used to lose the weight was Hammer and Chisel. It was definitely hard to keep up. I had to make a lot of modifications but I never gave up. I didnt use the bench, but I was able to add weights in eventually. That along with the PiYo DVD for stretching made an enormous difference in my endurance and flexibility. Not to mention the fact that I lost 27 pounds, it made it easier to move. Now I can do handstands, arm balances, inversions, and I feel light as a feather. Im healthier from the meal plans and stronger than I ever was when I used to work out at the gym. I feel like Shakeology and Beachbody literally saved my life!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I love all of the programs to be honest. I just started the 21 Day Fix and its equally amazing. I love how excited the trainers are in the videos that they make me smile and giggle while working out. They make it fun! I dont feel alone like I did on the treadmill everyday.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Im so proud that I have achieved diamond status and that so many people have entrusted me with their health and fitness journey. I feel excited to help people everyday. I feel great and energized everyday just from drinking the shakes.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I have become a successful Coach for Beachbody and recently earned diamond status. Everyone has been so impressed with my achievements and my results that they are ready for my help. And I am so happy to be able to share my journey with them as well as help them along their own personal journey.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Jamie has always been very supportive with any of my goals that I am trying to accomplish. She is right there with the answer to any question that I have.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Yes to all of the above, hahaha. I have IBS so I am not able to eat as many salads or raw vegetables as everyone else. So being able to drink the amount of nutrients that is in each shake is amazing. I feel like I have more energy. My coffee intake has gone down to one cup a day. I sleep better at night. Im an overall happier healthier person. Everyone notices how I smile more..and I seem happy.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort."

Start by baking the sweet potatoes. Preheat oven to 450 F. Wash and scrub 2 pounds of sweet potatoes. Pierce each sweet potato several times with a fork and place them on the center rack in your oven. Bake for 3545 minutes, or until tender when pierced. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.2. Next, bake chicken breasts. On a second baking sheet or dish, arrange 2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Season with any herbs or spices. Place baking dish in the oven for 1520 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and juices run clear. Let cool for 20 minutes, then place in refrigerator.3. Place 10 eggs in saucepan and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.4. To make the Turkey Marinara, add 2 pounds ground lean turkey to a medium pan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until turkey is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Add one 25-oz jar tomato sauce, no salt added, and stir. Remove from heat. Use a spiralizer or follow these instructions to make noodles out of 3 pounds of zucchinis: Using a vegetable peeler, cut each zucchini into lengthwise strips about -inch thick. Turn each zucchini slightly after cutting each strip to work evenly around the outside, stopping when you hit the seeds at the core. Discard cores. Cut slices lengthwise into -inch ribbons. Either steam the zucchini noodles in a steamer basket or gently saute them in a nonstick pan coated with cooking spray for 23 minutes. Divide zucchini noodles evenly between three food containers. Top each with one with the fully cooked turkey mixed with tomato sauce, top with 3 Tbsp. of Parmesan, and add a side of  cup of sweet potatoes.5. A rice cooker will make quick work of cooking the quinoa, and will shut off automatically when its done. If you do not have a rice cooker, it can be cooked on a stovetop. Cook  cup quinoa in 1 cup water and then set aside to cool.6. Make the roasted tomatoes and eggplant. Preheat oven to 375 F. In a non-stick pan, add 3 tsp. of olive, 2 cupsof plum tomatoes, and 2 eggplants chopped into cubes, spread evenly. Put the pan into the oven for about 20 minutes until roasted.7.Steam the kale by using a steamer, or follow these instructions: Put about one inch of water into a large pot and bring to a boil. Wash 4 cupsof kale and put it into a metal colander. Place the colander in the pot with the boiling water for about eight minutes until wilted.8. Prepare the chicken dinners. Set out two containers. To each, add 6 oz. of the baked boneless, skinless chicken breast and top with 1 cup roasted tomatoes, 1 cup eggplant, and  cup quinoa.9. Prepare the turkey lunches. Set out three containers. To each, add 6 oz. ground turkey, 2 cups steamed kale,  cup sweet potato, and 3 Tbsp. avocado.10. Make the salad dressing. Place 4 tsp. olive oil and balsamic vinegar to taste in small bowl and mix well. Set aside.11. Next build the Salad Jars. Set out three large mason jars (or food storage containers). Add 2 Tbsp. dressing to the bottom of the jar (if youre not using jars, reserve the dressing until just before serving). To each jar add 6 oz. chicken breast, 1 cup spinach,  cup tomatoes,  cup carrots,  cup edamame. Cover and place in refrigerator.12. Last, prepare the oatmeal jars. Set out five pint-sized mason jars. To each add  cup oats,  cup Greek yogurt, and 1 cup berries. Cover and place in refrigerator. The oats will absorb the yogurt, and will become soft enough to eat. Serve cold.Grocery List:Vegetables3 bags baby spinach1 bunch celery2 10-oz. bags kale1 9-oz. box shelled edamame1 avocados2 lb. sweet potato2 16-oz. bags baby carrots6 bell peppers2 eggplant3 lb. zucchini squashFruits1 bunch bananas2 20-oz. containers blackberriesProteins2 lb. lean ground turkey2 lb. chicken breastDry and Canned Goods1 18-oz. container oatmeal1 16-oz. bag quinoa1 25-oz. jar tomato sauce, no salt added1 16-oz. jar almond butter2 16-oz. containers plum tomatoes1 12-oz. container raw almondsDairy and Eggs1 dozen eggs5 7-oz. containers plain, Greek yogurt.25 lb.

Quick Pickled Red Onions
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/quick-pickled-red-onions-recipe,"Used far too often (in my opinion, anyway) as a garnish, topping or way to overpower a delicate tangle of mixed baby greens, raw onion has an acrid bite thats tamed through a process called pickling. All you need is a little acid, some salt and sugar, water and a mason jar. Drop slices of your onion of choice  red onion adds a gorgeous pop of color to any dish  into the salty-sweet brine and let sit for at least 10 minutes.By the time you finish prepping the other ingredients in your main dish, youll have a tasty, low-calorie, low-sugar topping that pairs with just about any salad, sandwich, grain bowl or protein.Quick Pickled Red OnionsTotal Time: 1 hr. 10 min.Prep Time: 10 min.Cooking Time: NoneYield: 8 servings, 2 Tbsp. eachIngredients:1 medium red onion, thinly sliced1 cup apple cider vinegar2 Tbsp. raw honey1 Tbsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)2 cups waterPreparation:1.

Beachbody Results: Benjo Benefits Big-Time By Body Building
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-benjo-benefits-big-time-by-body-building,"Benjo Reyes, age 35, lost 58 lbs. with 21 Day Fix, The Masters Hammer and Chisel, Shakeology, and the Beachbody Performance supplements. He entered his results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I was living in denial. For the past 12 years, I kept telling myself that I wasfine and that I could get back to being healthy anytime. Honestly, I kept lying to myself that I could easily get back in shape so I could splurge on food. With each bite of a burger or pizza, I kept saying I couldwork it off later. Well, that later never happened and my weight kept increasing. As my weight increased, I also developed high blood pressure and have been taking meds. I reached 235 pounds, waking up with knee pains and laboring to walk up stairs. I struggled to breathe, to the point of embarrassment, when a co-worker told me I was breathing hard like Darth Vader during a conference call. I hated the fact that I let myself go. I had very low energy and did not enjoy moving much, let alone exercise. I was on the path to an early grave, and it scared me.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My current Coach kept posting her progress daily on Facebook, and it showed up on my feed each time. It got me to start thinking that if a person I know personally can make a change, then why cant I? So I took the leap of faith and decided to try 21 Day Fix and Shakeology, then decided to jump onto The Masters Hammer and Chisel challenge that started in January 2016. I now have a 10-month-old baby boy, and one thing I did not want to be is a dad who cant even run after his own kid. We have had friends and family who have lost a parent due to obesity, and I did not want to be that for my future child. I made a commitment to myself and to my family that I will start the program and finish so that I can be a healthy individual with energy and confidence.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Finding time was a challenge for me going into the program. I live an hour away from work and usually work long hours. I did not think I would have the time needed to get my workouts in. I am usually exhausted by the time I get home. So in order to overcome this challenge, I committed myself to wake up early during my first week. So I set my alarm for 4:30 AM, and it was a struggle during my first week.But soon I was able to make it a habit. As I continued with the workouts and my early morning routine, it became easier to wake up early and I found that I had more energy. Also, the traffic on my way home can get pretty congested. Instead of rushing out of my office, I decided to use our wellness room to get an extra 30 minutes of a workout. By finding ways around my time limitations, I was able to get amazing results with The Masters Hammer and Chisel.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I was hitting a plateau late 2015 and needed a new program to break me through to the next level. When The Masters Hammer and Chisel came out, I saw the results my friends werehaving. So I decided to get it. I enjoy that it incorporates weight lifting and cardio with the routines. It helped me gain muscle and lose weight. In 60 days, I lost over 15 pounds and feel much stronger. Sagi and Autumn are both great trainers who, combined together, really drive results.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?During my first round of The Masters Hammer and Chisel, I was able to shed over 15 pounds and still feel great doing it. I did not lose energy. In fact, I found more energy as the days went by. I was never hungry, because I was eating proportioned meals and snacks throughout the day. But if I were to choose an achievement to be proud of, it would have to be my newfound passion to be healthy and to help others. I found that during my time with the Beachbody program, I truly enjoyed helping motivate and inspire others within my group and circle of friends. I became more involved in our workout group pages, and my attitude toward life became much more positive. As I see other members succeed, it helps motivate me to keep going as well. Anytime someone falls, I do my best to pick them back up and keep going. We are not in this alone, and I am willing to help as much as I can.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My life truly has taken a 180-degree turn for the better. My recent visit to the doctor proved that these programs work. I am proud to say that I am now off of my blood pressure medication with a clean bill of health. I feel more energized, and my outlook on life is filled with positivity. I am now an active Coach and work toward helping others reach their own goals. I have regained confidence as well and have received many compliments onmy progress. Some have mentioned that I am a great inspiration to them, and I am truly honored by that. I am looking forward to completing my next challenge as well as helping many others complete theirs.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?The group I joined was a tremendous factor in keeping me on track. On the days I was not motivated to work out (and there were many), the group kept urging me to push forward. As others in my group posted their results, I was able to use it as an inspiration. As I sawpeople just like me find success, it drove me to keep on trying until I saw my own success and reached my goals.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?There were many times I felt like I fell off track slightly and that was usually the time I gave up on myself. My Coach and others on my team would follow up and provided the encouragement at the right time to keep me going. They never gave up on me and I truly appreciate that more than they will ever know.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?Shakeology made it easy for me to keep my nutrition on track for the most part. It represented one-thirdof my daily meals, so I really only had to stay accountable for my lunch and dinner. It was a no-brainer for me to keep up with Shakeology, because it gave me all the nutrients I needed to start my day. I also felt more energy throughout the day as I became more consistent with drinking Shakeology.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you have?I have had a history of high blood pressure to the point where I have been taking medication the past several years and in increasing doses. I was also at risk of developing diabetes due to my weight. By the time I completed my first round of 21 Day Fix, I checked in with my doctor and he was amazed with my results. My tests came out normal as well, and he immediatelytook me off my meds. Through the addition of The Masters Hammer and Chisel with my later rounds, I was able to maintain a normal blood pressure. That validated my decision to stick with the programs and find more success in my health with Beachbody and its team of Coaches and clients.Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (e.g. blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides, etc.)?My high blood pressure normalized after a month of the 21 Day Fix Challenge, along with Shakeology and The Masters Hammer and Chisel.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort."

If you do not have a rice cooker,cook quinoa on the stovetop using this method. Cook 1 cups quinoa in 3 cups water and then set aside to cool. To cool it quickly, remove it from the rice cooker or pan and spread it out on a baking sheet to expose more of its surface area.3.If you bought dry lentils instead of pre-cooked, cook them next. Sort through the lentils to make sure there are no small stones, then rinse them in a colander under cool water. Bring 3 cups water to a boil in medium saucepan over high heat; add 2 cups dry lentils. Bring the back to a boil, cover the pot, and reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil for about 20 minutes or until lentils are tender. Set aside to cool.4.Make the vinaigrette.

Transformation Tuesday: Maria Lost 26 Pounds with Hip Hop Abs!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-maria-lost-26-pounds-with-hip-hop-abs,"Maria had a three-year-old son that she couldnt play with because she was out of shape. She hadnt been able to lose the baby weight for years, and when a fitness contest popped up at her work, she had the perfect opportunity to get back in shape. She completed Hip Hop Abs, and was able to lose 26 pounds in 2 months! Heres her story in her own words:I couldnt play with my son without losing my breath. My clothes didnt fit right, I looked in the mirror or at pictures and felt depressed about how fat I was getting and how unhealthy I was feeling. I was tired all the time. My weight prevented me from running, jumping, dancing, and playing with my son.Someone at the school where I work decided to do a biggest loser competition. A friend gave me INSANITY to try to lose weight from home, but I knew I was not ready for such a hard routine. However, I loved Shaun Ts voice and how he motivated everyone, so I looked him up. Since I love dancing, Hip Hop Abs caught my attention, so I went ahead and ordered the program. Dancing was one of my passions, and I always wanted to learn hip hop. And hey, if I could do abs without actually doing abs, it was the way to go!I followed it to the T! We had weekly weigh-ins at school, and celebrated every time I lost 2 pounds! I was determined to win. I was invited to a Challenge Group, too, and thats where it all began to make sense. I met people like me, supporters, and I had accountability, not just at school, but every night I was posting in this group and getting suggestions and encouragement. Between the group, the school, and my willingness to change, I had a great transformation.Hib Hop Abs is fun and it doesnt really feel like you are working out, but youre building your body stronger each time you do it. I can do everything now, and more. I even became a Turbo Kick Instructor, Im currently practicing handstands and staying up for a few seconds! My goal is to walk with my hands holding up my body. Now, I love life, I love the way I look and feel, and Im always looking to trying on new clothes, going out on an adventure, and helping others feel the same way I do.You can change your life, too.

Mix and match the foods you want, when you want them.Heres how Amanda combined these prepared foods into three different lunches:Meal 1: cup raw mini bell peppers,  cup steamed broccolini,  cup steamed baby zucchini,  cup shrimp,and 1 cup sliced mango (Portion Fix containers = 2+ greens, 1 purple,1 red, 2 tsp.)Meal 2:1 cup raw mini bell peppers, cupsteamed broccolini,  cup roasted brussels sprouts, 3 oz. baked salmon (Portion Fix containers = 2+ greens, 1 red, 2 tsp.)Meal 3: cup raw mini bell peppers, 1cupsteamed broccolini,  cup cooked lentils, cup cauliflower rice with veggies, 3 oz. baked chicken breast(Portion Fix containers = 2 greens, 1 red, 2 yellows, 2 tsp.)Follow these simple steps to make Amandas buffet-style meal prep:1. First, roast the sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts. Turn on your oven to 375 F. Scrub two sweet potatoes and place on a baking large sheet. Wash a bag of brussels sprouts and arrange on the same baking sheet. Drizzle sprouts with two teaspoons olive oil. After 20 minutes, remove the brussels sprouts. Return the baking sheet to the oven and cook the sweet potatoes about 20 minutes more, or until they pierce easily with a fork. When cool, place sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts in the refrigerator.2. Next bake chicken breasts. On a second baking sheet or dish, arrange 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Drizzle each with 1 tsp. olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices you like. Place baking dish in the oven for 1520 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and juices run clear. Let cool for 20 minutes, then place in refrigerator.3. Place 8 eggs in saucepan and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.4. Next, poach salmon filets. Place 1 lb. of salmon filets in baking dish (skin-side down if it has skin). Drizzle with fresh herbs if you have them, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Add water to submerge salmon halfway. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. Thinner filets will cook faster, so start checking the fish after 15 minutes.5. Bring water to a boil in a large pot with a steaming basket. Place two artichokes in the basket, with the stems pointing up, and cover the pot with a lid. Cook until tender when the base is pierced with a knife, about 3045 minutes. Remove artichokes from the steamer basket, but leave the heat on. Allow the artichokes to cool, then place them in the refrigerator.6. Place broccolini in steamer basket. While broccolini cooks, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Steam broccolini until cooked to your liking, about 45 minutes. Remove it from the steamer basket, but leave the heat on. Let the broccolini cool, and then place in the refrigerator.7. Repeat the above steps with the whole baby zucchini or chopped large zucchini. Cook whole baby zucchini for 34 minutes, or chopped zucchini for 12 minutes, or until done to your liking. Turn off heat. Let the zucchini cool, and then place in the refrigerator.8. Next saut the cauliflower rice. If you bought cauliflower florets instead of pre-cut cauliflower rice, place them in a food processor and pulse until the cauliflower resembles rice. Heat 2 tsp. olive oil in a saut pan over medium heat. Add mixed pre-chopped vegetables or frozen vegetable which have been thawed. Cook the vegetables for 23 minutes until just soft. Add cauliflower rice and cook 12 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper if desired.9. Clean the saut pan you just used, and place it on a burner over medium heat. Add 2 tsp. olive oil and add 1 lb. peeled cocktail shrimp. Cook for 23 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shrimp is pink and opaque. Season with salt and pepper or a spice blend if desired. Let the shrimp cool for 20 minutes, then place in the fridge.10. Amanda makes her oatmeal each morning, cooking  cup dry old fashioned rolled oats in 1 cup water. If you prefer to cook your oatmeal ahead of time, heat 5 cups water to a boil over medium heat. Add a pinch of salt if desired. Add 2 cups oats, turn heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. When oatmeal has cooled, divide evenly between five food storage containers (about 1 cup oatmeal each).11. Peel and slice four mangoes. Place in refrigerator.12. Place frozen, shelled edamame in a food storage container. Place in refrigerator.13. Place pre-cooked or canned lentils in a food storage container. Place in refrigerator.Grocery List for this Buffet-Style Meal PrepProteins:1 lb. salmon1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts1 lb. shrimp1 dozen eggsShakeologyVegetables:2 containers broccolini (or broccoli)2 containers Brussel sprouts2 bags baby carrots1 bag mini bell peppers1 package fresh Asian-style vegetable mix1 bag cauliflower rice(or 1 small cauliflower)2 cartons mini zucchini2 medium artichokes2 large sweet potatoes2 medium avocados1 carton edamame(or 1 bag frozen edamame)Fruits:4 medium mangoes8 small bananas3 cartons mixed berriesDry Goods:2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not shown)Raw almondsOlive oilPaprikaPrepared Foods:Hummus2 packages cooked lentils (or 2 cans lentils)Balsamic vinaigrette"

Place 1 lb. pork loin cut in four pieces into a slow cooker or Dutch oven. Add 7 oz. canned jalapeos (optional) and 1 cups tomatillo salsa. If using a slow cooker, cook on high for 3 hours, or until pork is no longer pink and shreds easily.

Warm Asparagus and White Bean Salad
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/warm-asparagus-and-white-bean-salad-recipe,"Spring vegetables pair with creamy avocado and white beans to make this show-stopper of a salad that is beautiful enough for an elegant brunch and simple enough to be part of your next meal prep. Sauted garlic and lemon zest give it bold flavor, so a little fresh lemon juice is the only dressing it needs. We topped it with chopped pistachios to add crunch and for their lovely green hue.Look for bright green, tender stalks of asparagus with tightly closed tips. Avoid asparagus that looks limp or bruised or has woody stems. If you dont plan to cook your asparagus immediately, chop about an inch off the bottom of each stalk and wrap the cut ends in a damp paper towel, then store in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Young, thin asparagus will work best in this quickly cooked recipe. If you buy thicker asparagus, you may want to add an additional minute or two to the cooking time.Pea tendrils contribute an additional element of springs bounty to this salad. Pea tendrils (or pea shoots) are the new leaves and vining stems of pea plants. They taste mildly like peas, but also have floral notes and crunch that can take the place of lettuce. They are traditionally available only in spring, but some farms are now growing sprouts year-round. If you cant find them at your market, substitute watercress or baby spinach to enjoy this salad any time.This delicious asparagus and white bean salad is served warm, but can also be made ahead and served chilled. It is a perfect side dish for chicken or fish, and with 9 grams of protein and fiber, is hearty enough to be eaten as a vegetarian main course. If you are making it ahead of time, or for meal prep, add the avocado just before serving.Warm Asparagus and White Bean SaladTotal Time: 14 min.Prep Time: 10 min.Cooking Time: 4 min.Yield: 4 servingsIngredients:2 tsp. olive oil1 bunch asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 12 spears)2 cloves garlic, finely chopped1 cup canned white beans (or cannellini beans or navy beans), drained, rinsed1 cup pea tendrils (or watercress or baby spinach)1 medium avocado, chopped20 raw pistachios, chopped2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1 tsp. finely grated lemon peel (lemon zest)Preparation:1. Heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.2. Add asparagus; cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until asparagus is tender-crisp.3. Add garlic; cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.4. Place asparagus mixture, beans, pea tendrils, avocado, pistachios, lemon juice, and lemon peel in a medium bowl; toss gently to blend.5. Divide evenly between four serving bowls.Tip: Pea tendrils are also called pea shoots. They are the early stems of the pea plant. If you cant find them, or dont grow them, use watercress or baby spinach.If you have questions about the portions, please click here to post a nutrition question in our forums so our experts can help.

Beachbody Results: This Stay-at-Home-Mom Lost 81 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-this-stay-at-home-mom-lost-81-pounds-and-won-1500,"SharesAmanda Yanik, age 28, lost 81 lbs in six months with 21 Day Fix, 21 Day Fix EXTREME, The Masters Hammer and Chisel, and Beachbody On Demand Challenge du Jour. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Before starting the 21 Day Fix six months ago, I was feeling fairly well. I had been working all summer on clean eating, training for my first ever 5k, and had lost 34 pounds. Although I felt healthier, I still didnt see how this was going to become a forever change. I wanted more than weight loss. More than a diet. I wanted a complete lifestyle change and whole new way of living. I wanted to be toned, fit, and only eat what my body needednot what my head wanted. I wanted to cut out sugar and empty carbs and fill it with fresh fruits and vegetables. I was feeling like I needed more, I just didnt know what that more was until my wonderful aunt (and now Coach!) filled me in on the Beachbody program. Now I am hooked and I have made it my passion in life to help others discover the amazing-ness that is Beachbody!What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?After an intense three years full of moving from another state, having two children, becoming a stay-at-home-mom, breaking my leg, and buying a house, I felt lost. I felt like I had gotten swallowed up in pizza and chocolate and laying on the couch and watching TV and I felt awful. I wasnt taking care of myself and I was losing all that makes me who I am. I was spending so much energy on my kids, my house, my husband, his new job, and everything else, that I forgot to take care of myself. I packed on a ton of weight and felt absolutely horrible. I kept justifying it since I just had a baby or I just broke my leg or we didnt have enough money for a treadmill, but by doing that I really let myself down. My weight creeped up into the 360sand that was post-pregnancy!and I was ashamed. Ashamed of my 4x and 5x shirts not fitting, ashamed I was outgrowing Lane Bryant clothes and was going to have to start shopping online for bigger clothes, ashamed of my grocery cartI needed a change.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?People have always told me that I have a pretty face. It may sound silly, but I hate that sentence. It just makes me feel as if they are really saying, well your face is nice, but the rest of your body is a hot mess. And I think I hated it so much because it was true. I felt awful about myself and struggled with my self-esteem. It affected my marriage and other relationships. I would be jealous of my husbands co-workers and feel envious when I saw friends online losing weight. I would justify it by listing all the wonderful things that I had in my life: my husband, my children, my house, wonderful friends, but I realized I could never really appreciate all of those things without being happy first with myself. Losing weight during the 21 Day Fix has helped my confidence tremendously and therefor has made me a better mom, a better wife, and a better friend. It has inspired me to become a Coach and bring this amazing feeling I now have to others and I am now living the perfect life! Beachbody was the puzzle piece my life was missing for 28 years!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?21 days! It seems so quick and easy! I love the short time frame and the intense amount of activity and healthy eating that is crammed into those short three weeks. When I first heard about it I thought, I could eat well for three weeks and now that those three weeks have passed (plus another 21 weeks on top of that!), Im always ready for the next three! It provides an opportunity for short-term goals, which are essential in building a long-term lifestyle! I am still obsessed with my Shakeology that I used as a meal-replacer every single day since August and cannot wait to get my golden scoop! It makes me feel healthy, full, and alert. Plus I poop every day! That may be way too much information, but before the Shakeology came into my life, I was beyond irregular and uncomfortable. I cant imagine starting a morning without Autumn, or Shaun T, or the Beast and my Shakeology!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I honestly am in shock at my results. I had been working out and calorie counting for a few months previous to the 21 Day Fix and was able to lose 34 pounds during those 10 weeks, but in the last six months with Beachbody, I have now lost an additional 81 pounds! It has been astronomically, amazingly life changing! I love the workouts ranging from 21 Day Fix, to TurboJam, to Hammer and Chisel, and INSANITY MAX:30. With the help of the trainers, I am stronger, more flexible, and I have improved my overall endurance. I was able to complete my very first 5k run, as well as 2 more, after starting with Beachbody and ran my most recent one in record time! I also was able to start wearing clothes that havent fit me in over 10+ years and surpassed my 100 pound goal marker! I began as a miserable, unhealthy, unmotivated size 32 and am now a happy, radiant, optimistic, healthy size 18! My confidence is off the roof and made me so proud! But not only has my life changed, but now as a Coach, I work every single day to help others to do the same! My husband has lost over 40 pounds and my challengers have lost a combined total of over 200 pounds!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I truthfully dont even know where to begin to answer this question. My life is 100% different today than it was just eight months ago. Not only am I thinner, healthier, more confident, and overall happierbut so is my family. To watch my sweet boys and my amazing husband learn better eating habits, work out alongside of me, and have more energy is just so heartwarming. Being a mom of two young children and watching them change as I change has been one of the most rewarding parts of starting my new life with Beachbody and I cant even fathom where we were heading before I made the choice to start the Fix back on August.My boys were couch potatoes and now they do sit ups with me, I was lonely as a stay at home mom and now I have this amazing community of Coaches and challengers that I surround myself daily, my once lazy husband wakes me up to work out, and I truthfully could just go on and on. I am thankful for Beachbody and all it has given me every sine day of my life.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?My beautiful aunt, who also is my fearless Coach, puts herself out there every day on our Challenge Group page. She shows her ups and downs and encourages us to share ours as well. Her videos, motivational quotes, and recipes always keep me excited whenever I get a notification saying something was posted. Ive tried many new recipes that she recommended as well as ones from other members. Ive made new friends and learned so much about other women who all live different lives, yet we have our Challenge Group as common ground and we all are striving daily for the same thing. Every week we cheer each other on for our weight losses and applaud our workouts and critique our daily logs to see where we could do better, what was good, and get new ideas for foods to fill our containers. It is truly a major part of my success so far and I am looking forward to creating my own.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach has been there all along. She has told me from Day one that I needed to become a Coach and has supported me in everything Ive done. She has offered advice, recipes, motivational quotes, fun videos, and all the tools to help me train for my own business. She is always striving to better herself and inspire others to take action as well. My Coach is one of the busiest women I have ever met, but she is always there with an answer or funny quip when I need it. Shes the best and I could not have made it to where I am now without her funny videos, photos, and posts on our page as well as our many silly texting conversations. She was a huge fan of mine when I ran my 5k and helped me come up with a workout plan to incorporate running with the 21 Day Fix program. She rocks!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?I love me my Shakeology! Yum yum yum! I tried a few of the recipes, but still come back to my plain chocolate shake. It is beyond delicious and I have it every day after my morning workout. I truthfully go to bed at night looking forward to my workout being over in the morning so I can savor my yummy chocolate Shakeology! I always thought people who drank protein shakes were a bit odd, especially when they said they actually tasted good, but now I am that person who takes me shaker cup with me whenever I have plans so I can still have my treat. I dont drink it out of obligation, but out of love! It has deceased my sugar and chocolate cravings massively and holds me over for a few hours! It is filling, delicious, and energizing. I dont even need my coffee in the mornings anymore since I have my Shakeology! I cant say enough good things about it and I have been recommending it to everyone I know!You can change your life, too.

Avocado Egg Salad Toast
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/avocado-egg-salad-toast-recipe,"Egg salad is one of those tricky foods that seems healthy. Its made from eggs and its got the word salad right there in the name, but mayonnaise is the glue that holds it together and turns it into the creamy spread you know and love.But you know what makes a great substitution for mayo? Mashed avocado. It provides the same creamy texture, with a healthy dose of monounsaturated fat (thats the good kind) and gives you another twist on avocado toast. We added lemon juice to bring a touch of bright acidity to the dish and to help prevent the avocado from turning brown.To add a finishing touch to this dish, we topped the Egg Salad Avocado Toast with a small handful of watercress, the delicate leaves and crunchy stems of which add a peppery flavor. Watercress is so good for you, it earned the top spot as theCenters for Disease Control and Preventions most nutrient-dense fruit or vegetable most strongly associated with reduced chronic disease risk. Looks like those Brits were onto something with their tea sandwiches. If you cant find watercress, substitute arugula or baby spinach, which also made the list.Here are a few other variations to try: Dress up the avocado egg salad with some fresh, cracked pepper or a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Cut up some cherry tomatoes, green onions, or jalapeo slices and throw them into the mix. Swap out the toast for a whole grain tortilla and top it with salsa. Skip the toast and dip into the salad with whole grain crackers, endive leaves, or celery stalks. Going grainless?

Fitspiration Friday: I Had Gained More Than 70 Pounds Thanks to Fertility Treatments and Hormone Swings
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/womens-results/fitspiration-friday-i-had-gained-more-than-70-pounds-thanks-to-fertility-treatments-and-hormone-swings,"If youve tried a Beachbody program, youve probably had a goal in mind that you wanted to achieve. Maybe you wanted to lose weight. Maybe you wanted to get stronger. Maybe you wanted to improve your health. Maybe it was a mix of allthree,or something else entirely. But, along the way, no matter what your goal, everyone needs a little inspiration. Every other Friday, the Beachbody Success Stories team will share inspirational fitness stories from some of the folks who have done Beachbody programs. Maybe one will inspire you!Meet Sandra. After years of fertility treatments and miscarriages, Sandra had gained more than 70 pounds and couldnt seem to shed it.At 35, I was very fit. But, in my 40s, I gained more than 70 pounds trying to have a baby. Five miscarriages and wild hormone swings from shots, pregnancies and IUIattempts, packed on the pounds. I worked out religiously, weight trained with a trainer twice a week and did 45 minutes to an hour of cardio three times a week. But nothing worked. Even though I was on a diet of 1200 calories (or fewer).Every doctor I spoke with wanted to put me on diabetic medications or treat the symptoms, not find the cause. I looked for answers from every type of doctor and fitness specialist. I spent thousands on supplements and blood tests. Nothing helped.Finally, in October 2014, I found a doctor that adjusted my hormones and the symptoms and illnesses went away. I finally felt like my body would meet me halfway, and I might see some results.Despite the extra weight, I was in pretty good cardio health. My main issue was my back hurt from the excess weight in my chest, and my hips and knees ached from carrying it all. I was embarrassed when I saw pictures of myself because that was not how I saw myself and not how I wanted my daughter to know me. In December2014we took a family photo shoot in Cancun and I loved all the pictures of the family except for how large I looked. I was stunned. it was not who I saw in the mirror every day.Last January, I met one of my best friends in Las Vegas for the weekend.Herand her husband had done21 Day Fixand were working onP90X3with great results. She observed that I didnt eat much and she knew I worked out all the time. She encouraged me to try 21 Day Fix because she knew the diet would fit my busy work schedule. I have to eat at my desk because I manage money and trade stocks, so I dont leave my desk from market open to market close. The containers were a great way to get my eating organized and the program wasnt intimidating. Id prep food on Sunday for the week and fill my containers the night before so there was no excuse for not taking my lunch. For five weeks, I did 21 Day Fix and did an additional 45 minutes of cardio on the weekdays. I lost 15 pounds.This encouraged me to step it up with21 Day Fix Extreme. So, for the next 12 weeks, I committed to that program (along with additional cardio on the weekdays). I was down 44 pounds! My friend encouraged me to try P90X3. I loved it and finished that down 53 pounds. I am not yet at my goal weight, but my initial goal was to lose 50 pounds by my 50th birthday and I achieved that goal! I celebrated with a new bikini and a trip to Cancun with my best friend.This past fall, I tried out new workouts inBeachbody On Demand. I startedThe Masters Hammer & Chiselwith my friend on December 14th together and every time we get together we work out in the mornings. Its become our thing and its so much fun. Even though I have to get up at 4:15 AM to get my workouts in and get to the gym to do my 45 minutes of cardio, I fit it in. I am now down 58 pounds and wearing a size 10 Petite.I have a beautiful 6-year-old daughter that we adopted at birth. She works out with me every weekend, and on someweekdaysshe crawls out of bed and joins me, even if it is just to watch. She is a great comic relief and is quick to point out if my form is not quite as good as Autumns, Tonys, or Sagis.This month was my one year anniversary of starting this journey and Ive been reflecting and celebrating the successes. I am so happy to have the old me back. I never thought of myself as fat, but pictures dont lie. What is funny is that my lifelong friends look at pictures of me from two years ago and they say they dont remember me that way either."

How to Cook: Lentils
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-cook-lentils-recipe,"Many Beachbody recipes include pre-cooked items such as lentils, chicken, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. And while some of you are expert chefs, we wanted to even the playing field with a series of how-to articles that will teach you how to cook the basics. Were kicking the series off with how to cook lentils. (Let us know in the comments what you want to see next!)Lentils are cheap, cook up quickly, and are loaded with fiber and protein. When eaten together with rice, theyform a complete vegetarian protein.Look for them in the bulk bins of your grocery store, or packaged with other dried beans. Some markets sell pre-cooked lentils, but they are easy to make yourself and cost just pennies per serving.Lentilscome in a variety of colors, from brilliant orange and red to muted green and brown, and each has its own flavor and texture profile. Its also important to note that the cooking time differs between each.Brown LentilsWhether they are alight, khaki color ordark greenish-brown, brown lentils are the most common type of lentils. They have a mild, creamy flavor similar to kidney beans. These are the lentils used in our recipe below. They hold their shape well, but can also be easily mashed to form bean burgers or vegetarian meatloaf. Brown lentils have a similar cooking time to white rice, so you can cook them together with a variety of spices, like cumin, curry, or cardamom.Varieties:Spanish Brown, German Brown, Indian BrownCooking time:2030 minutesGreen LentilsRanging from pale sagein colorto dark green mottled with brown or black, green lentilshave a robust earthy andslightly peppery flavor. They generally take the longest to cook, and when done,their exterior texture remains firm, while the interior is tender. Because they hold their shape so well, they are ideal as a hearty side dish or served asa bed for proteins.Varieties:Puy, French GreenCooking Time:3040 minutesRed Lentils:These thin discs look similar to split peas. Red lentilsarethe sweetest and mildest pulse in the lentils familyandrange in color from red to pinktopaleyellow. This varietycooks quickly andbreaks downto forma flavorful, thick paste that is perfect forsoups, stews, curries, and sauces.Varieties:Crimson or Red Chief (also known asmasoor dal)Cooking time:1520 minutesBlackLentils:When cooked, tiny black lentils glisten like beluga caviar, creating a dramatic color contrast with other ingredients in a dish. They have a rich, nutty flavor and velvety texture that tastes great ingreen salads, pastas, and mixed vegetables.Varieties:Beluga, (also known asurad dal)Cooking Time:3040 minutesKeep tasting your lentils as they cook to see if theyre the textureyou want  firm if youre eating them as a side dish,softer if theyre meant forsoup or stew. Once lentils are cooked, pair them with fish, chicken, or pork loin, or keep them in the fridge to use in abuffet-style meal prep. They can also take the place of beans in soups and chilis. Want to get really adventurous? Try scrambling them with eggs, tossing them in green salads and grain bowls, and add some vinegar to help further enhance their flavor.How to Cook Lentils:Total Time:30 min.Prep Time:5 min.Cooking Time:25 min.Yield:4 servings,  cup eachIngredients:1 cup dry brown lentils1 cups waterSea salt (to taste; optional)Preparation:1.

This Kale Salad Has More Calories Than a Double Big Mac (No, Really)
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/this-kale-salad-has-more-calories-than-a-double-big-mac,"McDonalds recently stepped up their salad game, adding a kale salad to its Canadian menu. When we first got wind of the Keep Calm, Caesar On salad, we were curious  after all, it was only a year ago that McDs was throwing shade at kale in a Big Mac commercial.The official nutritional numbers for the kale salad took us by surprise. Turns out, you might actually be better off sticking with a burger  even the four-patty Double Big Mac.The kale-based Caesar salad with crispy chicken, clocks in at 520 calories, 31 grams of fat, and 1,140 grams of sodium. And thats before you add the asiago dressing, which adds another 210 calories and 22 grams of fat. The grand total is 730 calories, 53 grams of fat, and 1,400 grams of sodium (about the same as Burger Kings Bacon Chicken Ranch Salad or Wendys Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad). It is also available with grilled chicken, though the website does not include the nutritional information for that option. By comparison, the Double Big Mac  which includes four beef patties  has 680 calories, 38 grams of fat, and 1,340 milligramsof sodium.The salad is also loaded with vague-sounding ingredients like flavor, color, and microbial enzyme. (Yum?) And the crispy chicken alone contains more than 15 ingredients. When youre looking at a food product, look at the ingredients, says Denis Faye, MS, Senior Director of Nutrition Content for Beachbody. Ideally, a salad should be made from whole ingredients  such as veggies, beans, seeds, oil, and vinegar.So why would McDonalds bother adding kale to its menu if theyre going to smother it with crispy chicken, cheesy croutons, and bacon? Most likely, they dont want to lose their more health-conscious customers. Theres a lot of pressure on fast food chains to health up, Faye says. But even though salad might seem like a healthier option than a quadruple cheeseburger, its really not a game-changer. In fact, the fact that this calorie-bomb takes the form of a salad makes it almost worse. The salad has some greens, Faye notes, but if you look at a burger, you have a little lettuce and tomato on there. Its the same thing, but not in sheeps clothing. Its okay to occasionally eat fast food, Faye adds. But dont fool yourself into thinking this is a healthy meal.So if youre jonesing for a burger, you might as well order a burger, because the Caesar salad wont satisfy your cravings or save you any calories. If youre trying to take baby steps towards healthier eating habits, a better bet would be to order a cheeseburger with a side garden salad instead of fries, opt for balsamic vinaigrette, and only use half the dressing. That will give you a fast food splurge with a side of actual veggies, and your total caloric intake will only be 390 calories. And best of all, your diet wont have been derailed by a cheat meal in disguise.Or, hey, try this healthier version of a classic Caesar."

Fitspiration Friday: 21 Day Fix Helped Me Regain My Confidence and Strength
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/fitspiration-friday-21-day-fix-helped-me-regain-my-confidence-and-strength,"If youve tried a Beachbody program, youve probably had a goal in mind that you wanted to achieve. Maybe you wanted to lose weight. Maybe you wanted to get stronger. Maybe you wanted to improve your health. Maybe it was a mix of all three, or something else entirely. But, along the way, no matter what your goal, everyone needs a little inspiration. Every other Friday, the Beachbody Success Stories team will share inspirational fitness stories from some of the folks who have done Beachbody programs. Maybe one will inspire you!Meet Jennifer. A few years ago, she experienced major strokes and brain aneurysms that changed her life. After an amazing recovery, the 21 Day Fix helped her regain both confidence and strength.I am recovering from two massive strokes and seven brain aneurysms that happened on June 30, 2008. My right side is still very weak from it. I was totally paralyzed on my right side. I couldnt sit up, talk, walk, eat, or do anything for myself. That July, at the age of 26, I moved into a nursing home and stayed there until I checked myself out in October. There, I relearned to talk, relearned to how to walk and went to speech, physical, and occupational therapy every day. It felt hopeless, and I feared my life as I had known it was over. I felt like a baby trapped in an adults body. On top of this, I had a three and a five-year-old. But, the only way out of there was through intensive physical and occupational therapy and willpower. I also had to be vulnerable and give it to God and let Him take care of everything. It was the hardest, darkest time in my life.Outside the nursing home.At one point, I was cleared by my doctor to work out. My physical therapist had a gym at the office, and he always encouraged me to work out. I was scared to sit on a stationary bike because I thought I might fall. Plus, I was only able to ride it for a few minutes. I also couldnt move the first weights on the equipment. In fact, I was so weak, I could barely open the door to the gym. But I kept going back and kept working at it, getting stronger and stronger as the years passed. But, I felt less than the other people I worked out around. I felt I needed a nutrition makeover. I was tired and irritable from a poor diet. I didnt know that then, but its very apparent to me now.I felt like 21 Day Fix would be a good change up to my regular workout routine because I had felt like I was spinning my wheels and not getting traction. I also knew I wasnt eating right for the work I was putting in and I had no idea how to change it. I would work out at the gym and then go to KFC. I knew I was sabotaging myself and that something had to give. My Beachbody coach told me how well Shakeology was working for her, and she told me about the 21 Day Fix. It took me a few months to convince myself, but I finally took the plunge.I loved Autumns encouraging, motivating way of training. I loved being in a group that held me accountable for my actions. My goal was to get healthier, but I got so much more. I was amazed at how much I could eat and lose weight. I was astonished that the 30-minute workouts that felt more effective than my usual two-and-a-half hours at the local gym. I loved that I quickly saw real results, and I loved how much healthier I felt all around.The 21 Day Fix melted fat off my body that I didnt even know I had. It revealed healthy, lean muscle that I worked so hard for in the gym, but I could never fully see it. It changed my body by helping me lose that few extra pounds. I now have greater range of motion with my arm, shoulder, and leg on my weak side. I also found out I can do jumping jacks. I ran for the first time since my stroke! I am so incredibly proud of that! Running was my thing before my stroke and I did it again! I learned my weak side is much more capable than I ever thought. I feel healthier than I ever have in my entire life.Recently, I moved to California to explore, mountain climb, snowboard, swim in the rivers and lakes, wakeboard, and to truly enjoy my life. I am going to continue to get healthier and stronger so I can do all of those things. My kids deserve to have a capable Mommy who can keep up with all the things they love to do. I am going to participate in my first 5K walk. My goal is to be able to run the length of the road I live on down and back, which would be about a 1/4 mile, by the end of the year. My ultimate goal is to run marathons. Running is what makes me feel free. Everything God gave me when he made me is still inside of me, I just have to learn how to free it all.On a difficult hike in San Francisco.Thanks to Beachbody, I am learning to stand in my power, as Sagi Kalev always says.My doctors are amazed at how much better I keep getting but I never give up. Even if I couldnt hold a weight during Upper Fix, I never stopped moving or trying. I will master it someday. When my mind wants to quit, my heart keeps me going. I want my life back and working out is the only way to get there. I actually feel like Im on the road to a long, happy, healthy life. Ive found what I love, what I have passion for, and it has lead me to my purpose.. to help other people achieve their goals."

Turning 60 on Day 9 of the 21 Day Fix was challenging for me. My co-workers understood my goal and supported me, but at the same time wanted to acknowledge my birthday, so they got me one single cupcake. It was yummy, but I felt bad cheating. I also cheated at dinner that night. But I knew that I would get back on track by just reading the posting of the many people in the Facebook challenge page. After completing the 21 Days, I felt so much better. I could really see a big difference in my face, and my jeans started fitting like they should.I would also like to give a big shout out to the Beachbody On Demand.

However, I myself had never committed to the program. My Year-End Resolution was to create my own Success Story! I committed to doing a round in December. This helped me correct any weight/bloat gained during Thanksgiving and kept me on track during the most tempting month of the year for poor food choices. From my December Fix I lost 10.8 pounds and gained some amazing new muscle definition. For once, I felt like the scale was reflecting the changes I saw in the mirror  Ive never been more proud of myself!In 21 days with 21 Day Fix EXTREME, Cory D. lost 4 pounds and went from regular to ripped in preparation for the arrival of his newborndaughter.I really enjoyed the Year-End Resolution Challenge! I loved that it brought a large group of people together to focus on their health and fitness at a time of year when those topics are more often shoved aside in favor of holiday parties & shopping. Personally, I took on a round of 21 Day Fix EXTREME. Its a very tough program, but I knew it would bring results. My 3rd baby was due on the day I finished. Gotta be ready for her! With the help of the Year-End Resolution Challenge accountability group, my own accountability group, and my Beachbody Coach (my wife) I stuck to the workout schedule and mostlystuck to the nutrition plan as well! I mainly got these workouts done at home, but sometimes my work schedule dictated that I stop by the gym to get my workout in, at which time Beachbody On Demand was key. Having the freedom to access the workouts anywhere gave me the necessary flexibility to stick to the program no matter what! So, at the end of a tough, soreness-inducing 21 days, I lost 4 pounds, dropped my body fat from 9.1 to 7.5%, gained muscle in my chest while losing 2 inches in my waist (Ill take that trade off!), and felt fit and strong to take on the new year!You can change your life, too.

5 Winter Running Tips
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/5-winter-running-tips,"Its a well-established fact that the treadmill becomes increasingly attractive as the mercury plummets. But as long as the roads are plowed and you own a few key pieces of performance gear, theres no reason to spin your wheels indoors  especially if you have your eyes on a 10K or a marathon in April or May. Winter is also a great time to work on the mental toughness side of training, says Ron Byland, a USA Track and Field-certified coach based in Minneapolis. Come spring, youll be really ready to tackle new PRs.So grab a beanie, pull on some thermal tights, and prepare to hit the hardback running  with these five winter running tips, youll never have to let snow, sleet, or subzero temps get in the way of a workout again.Find Your FootingOnce the snow starts to fall, youll need to rethink your footwear. The reason: Underneath all of that powder are a host of hidden dangers  ice, roots, potholes, uneven terrain  and youll want shoes that can handle the extra punishment. I often switch to trail running shoes in winter, says Brendan Cournane, an elite Chicago-based running coach who has competed in marathons in all 50 states and all seven continents. Many of them have water-resistant uppers that help keep your feet dry, and their more aggressive lugs improve grip on slick terrain. Think of it like swapping your summer tires for winter ones  the deeper treads makes a huge difference when it comes to maintaining control.Dont want to shell out for a new pair of shoes? There are plenty of grip enhancing devices that slip over the soles of existing shoes. Our pick: Yaktrax Run ($40, yaktrax.com). They easily attach to any type or size of running shoe, says Liz Corkum, a Road Runners Club of America-certified coach, nutritionist, and personal trainer based in New York City. Theyve gotten me through many 20-milers in tough conditions.Adjust Your FormGrippy shoes are a good start, but youll also need to modify your running technique if you want to stay on your feet. Each stride should be more of a shuffle with both feet closer to the ground, says Cournane, who also suggests slowing your pace and sticking to plowed streets and well-traveled sidewalks. Packed snow provides better traction.When you make a turn, shorten your stride even more. It almost looks like Im jogging in place when I switch directions on slick sidewalks, says Heather Kampf, the 2014 USA 1-mile road champion. Being intentional about each step can help prevent nasty spills.Increase Your VisibilityShorter days often translate into darker runs, making it more important than ever to remain visible. Always wear bright colors and reflective gear, says Corkum. Look for clothing that has reflective material in key biomotion points, such as your wrists, ankles, and feet, so oncoming traffic can identify you as a human rather than a road sign, and give you extra room. If you run in locations that are completely dark after sundown, also consider wearing a headlamp, says Corkum. Not only will it add another layer of visibility, but it will also help you watch your step.Stay HydratedMany runners forget how much they sweat in cold weather, says Cournane. But sweat isnt the only way you losing fluid  that mist your see every time you exhale in cold weather is water vapor condensing into tiny droplets and ice particles.Try to drink half your weight in ounces of water throughout the day  if you weigh 150 pounds, your goal is 75 ounces, for example  and if your run lasts longer than an hour, carry a water bottle. Fill it with warm water before you head out so it wont freeze, suggests Cournane.Layer UpBritish author Alfred Wainwright once wrote that theres no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing. Never is that more true than during the winter, and oddly enough, one of the biggest mistakes people make is dressing too warmly. I tell my runners to dress as if the temperature is 15-20 degrees warmer than whats showing on the thermometer, says Cournane. It only takes about a half mile to a mile for most peoples bodies to warm up to a comfortable level.That said, its always better to err on the side of caution, and layering (i.e., wearing multiple levels of clothing) will allow you to make adjustments on the fly. If you normally wear cotton when you exercise, stop  it holds moisture close to the skin, increasing heat loss. Instead, invest in some technical, moisture-wicking clothing, and then follow this cold-weather layering guide to maximize your comfort and performance during every run:Above 60:Shorts and a short-sleeve shirt.50 to 59:Same as above, but swap short sleeves for long sleeves.40 to 49:Shorts or light tights and a half-zip, long sleeve shirt, which will allow you to vent if you become too warm. If its windy, also wear a light shell.30 to 39:Technical underwear, tights, half-zip top, insulated vest, gloves, and a thin beanie. If its windy, also wear a light shell.20 to 29:Technical underwear, tights, half-zip top, insulated jacket, gloves, and a thin beanie.1 to 19:Windproof underwear, heavier tights, half-zip top, insulated jacket, insulated gloves, beanie, face mask.Below 0:Thick socks, windproof underwear, heavier tights, half-zip top, insulated vest or jacket, wind-proof shell, insulated gloves, beanie, face mask."

Does Breastfeeding Really Help You Lose Weight + 11 Other Myths Revealed
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/wellness/does-breastfeeding-really-help-you-lose-weight-11-other-myths-revealed,"There are a lot of assumptions made about breastfeeding. Its the best way to deliver nutrients to your baby; its the most natural way to feed your little one; it wreaks havoc on your nipples, and changes the shape of your beautiful breasts forever. Perhaps one of the biggest ones, at least for moms who cant wait to drop the baby weight and get back in shape: It burns massive calories, and is natures way of helping new moms lose weight.Because this last notion can be so crucial to moms who might long to regain some control over their postpartum bodies rather quickly, lets dispel the myth that breastfeeding will automatically help you lose weight. Yes, it burns calories, and may help lower body mass index (see myth #1 below for more details), but you cant skip the basic weight-loss principles (and overall good health) of keeping an eye on total daily calories, moving more, and choosing quality whole foods to fulfill your nutrition needs and those of your baby.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life, and then at least partially for the next six months (since you can introduce solid foods at this point). Outside of that, though, the decision of whether or not to breastfeed, how often to do it, and when to stop are highly individualized.Ultimately, each individual mother is uniquely qualified to decide whether breastfeeding, mixed feeding, or formula feeding is best for her individual situation, says Alison Stuebe, M.D., distinguished scholar of infant and young child feeding at the Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute, and associate professor of maternal fetal medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Were not here to tell you what choices you should and shouldnt be making. But we are here to make sure youre accurately informed. From whether or not to use formula to sore nipples to abstaining from caffeine and alcohol, there are a ton of rumors around breastfeeding. Which are true and which are myths? We had experts weigh in on 12 of the most popular ones so you can better decide whats best for you.12 Myths About Breastfeeding: Whats the Truth?Myth: Breastfeeding helps you lose the pregnancy weight.Truth: Unarguably, breastfeeding causes you to burn calories  the American Pregnancy Association recommends consuming an extra 300500 calories a day. A Dutch study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that breastfeeding could help women  with the exception of those who weighed the most before pregnancy  eliminate weight gained during pregnancy (about 26 pounds) after six months.Whats more, a study in the International Journal of Obesity looked at nearly 750,000 women ages 50 to 64 and found that those who had breastfed their babies not only had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who did not breastfeed, but they also decreased their BMIs by one percent for every six months they breastfed.But, just because breastfeeding helps you burn more calories doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight, points out Laura Gruber, international board certified lactation consultant, registered lactation consultant, and owner of Breastfeeding Housecalls in San Antonio.Breastfeeding mothers tend to feel hungrier, which means they may snack more to make up for those extra calories burned. The choice to consume healthy or unhealthy snacks, and the quantity a mother consumes is what may ultimately drive some moms not to lose the pregnancy weight via breastfeeding alone, Gruber says.Youre still eating for two when you breastfeed, meaning that you pass along whatever nutrition you take in to your baby. This doesnot meanthat you should eat as much of whatever foods youd like, especially if those foods arent nutrient-dense. Eat enough calories to fuel your body properly for nursing, and whatever exercise program you may be doing. If youre following a Beachbody program, you might want to bump up to the next (higher) calorie bracket (considering that breastfeeding burns an extra 300500 calories per day).Myth: You cant breastfeed if you have implants.Truth: Its safe for mothers and for babies to breastfeed if mom has implants, Alison Stuebe reassures. But if you have had plastic surgery, its important to let your doc know. Why? Your natural breasts may affect how well you produce milk.If one breast was much smaller than the other, or if you had minimal breast tissue, you might make less milk, so its important to work closely with your babys provider to monitor early weight gain so that you and your baby get off to a good start, Stuebe adds.If you have breast implants and plan to breastfeed, you may need to supplement to ensure your baby gets enough to eat. A review and meta-analysis of three observational studies published in the International Breastfeeding Journal revealed that women with breast implants who breastfed were less likely to feed their infants with breast milk exclusively compared to women without breast implants. Another study published in the Annals of Plastic Surgery also reported that many women with breast implants needed to supplement their breastfeeding.Myth: You must use both breasts each time you feed.Truth: Its a good idea to offer both, Gruber says. Sometimes babies lose vigor and stamina at the breast because they are tired, yet not necessarily full. They can become tired from sucking on a breast that isnt yielding as much as they need, she explains.Her recommendation: Use your first breast until a baby loses vigor or stamina, since this is the most accurate way of knowing if a healthy baby is getting full. Stop and burp him or her, then always offer the second breast in case baby has made room for more [after] burping. If your baby doesnt want the second breast, thats fine. Then, you can start with the second breast at the next feed, since it will likely be fuller, she adds.Myth: Modern formulas are almost the same as breastmilk.Truth: Formula makers may market their product as being almost as good as the real thing. Breastmilk is a living fluid. Formula is not, Stuebe says. To illustrate, scientists have found that human milk contains immune and stem cells, as well as bacterial community.A mothers milk contains bacteria that colonize her babys gut, helping to grow the babys immune system. And while some formulas have added prebiotics and probiotics, they are fundamentally different from breast milk, Stuebe explains.Myth: Poor milk supply is caused by moms inadequate diet or stress.Truth: There are millions of women everywhere who have stressful lives and poor nutrition yet are still able to produce perfect amounts of milk for their babies, Gruber points out. Low milk supply is generally caused by poor breastfeeding management (such as not feeding baby frequently, or a shallow latch), hormonal issues in mom, or oral issues in baby that would cause poor milk transfer, she explains.Myth: You cant drink alcohol while breastfeeding.Truth: Great news mamas  this ones a myth. It takes about two hours for a single serving of alcohol (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, or 1.5 oz. of liquor) to clear a womans bloodstream. When it clears her bloodstream, it also clears her milk, Stuebe explains.More alcohol does takes more time to clear out, so you may need to pump and discard milk if youve had two or three servings. Check this handy chart that Stuebe recommends.Myth: Breastfeeding is supposed to hurt.Truth: Breastfeeding may feel new and different, but it is not supposed to hurt, Gruber says. With the exception of childbirth, pain is the bodys alert system when something is wrong, so nipples that hurt mean that something is off and can be improved. Moms who feel nipple pain, see or feel their nipples injured, or see misshapen nipples when her baby unlatches should seek help, she adds.Myth: Breastfeeding drastically changes the shape and size of your breasts.Truth: For starters, its important to understand that pregnancy is what changes your body, not breastfeeding. Secondly, your breasts will change, but only temporarily. Breastfeeding can drastically change the shape and size of a womans breasts  but only during certain seasons of nursing, such as when moms milk is transitioning from colostrum to mature milk, Gruber says. Breasts normally return back to pre-pregnancy size and shape after a woman has ended her breastfeeding season.A study published in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal reviewed the charts of 93 patients seeking consultation for aesthetic breast surgery, and found that breastfeeding does not appear to have an adverse effect upon breast appearance.Myth: Breastfeeding is just about getting the milk to your baby.Truth: Nurturing your baby is about so much more than nursing. Breastfeeding is about fostering a biological connection between a mother her child, and a mother can nurture her baby at breast no matter how much milk she makes, Stuebe says. Suckling a baby triggers release of the hormone oxytocin, which can encourage bonding and mothering behavior. A baby who is at breast can hear moms heartbeat, and can focus his eyes on moms face.Even moms who dont provide 100 percent of their babys nutrition from their breasts are still able to offer them for suckling, warmth, and comfort. Being an infants food source is just one of the many hats that breasts wear when it comes to babies, Gruber adds.Myth: Smaller breasts may not produce enough milk to feed the baby.Truth: Bra size isnt a reliable predictor of milk production, but some breasts do produce better than others, Stuebe says.OK, quick biology lesson from Stuebe: An adult womans breasts are made up of both fatty tissue and milk-making glandular tissue. One woman might have small breasts that are packed with glandular tissue (great for milk production), while another has very large breasts that are mostly fatty tissue (not so great). And the shape matters, too  widely spaced or cone-shaped breasts can be associated with low milk production, Stuebe adds.Its not easy to predict milk-making based on breast size, which is why its important that all moms and babies see a pediatric provider at three to five days after birth to check in on how breastfeeding is going, Stuebe says.Myth: You cant get pregnant while breastfeeding.Truth: We dont know who started this rumor, but breastfeeding is definitely not birth control. You can absolutely get pregnant while nursing, Gruber reassures.Frequent nursing does prevent ovulation. But, if you pump and use bottles, or your baby doesnt want to eat often, youre going a longer time between feedings at the breast than a mom who breastfeeds every couple of hours. This break can cause a mom to ovulate earlier thus sparking moms fertility even if that mom hasnt had her first period yet after childbirth, Gruber explains.If you want to avoid pregnancy, talk to your doc about birth control options. And dont worry; Gruber assures contraception wont reduce your milk supply.But, can contraception impact the quality of your milk? Research draws mixed conclusions; one review revealed a negative effect on breast milk composition in moms taking birth control, while another trial showed greater weight gain in infants whose moms had an etonogestrel implant. An article published in Clinical and Obstetrics and Gynecology found that the choice and timing of contraception  with nonhormonal methods being the preferred choice  may influence breastfeeding and infant growth patterns. The bottom line: Talk openly with your doctor to explore all of the options to find out what works best for you and your baby.Myth: The longer you breastfeed, the healthier your baby will be in adolescence.Truth: This ones a bit more complicated. Theres compelling evidence that, on a population level, longer breastfeeding is linked with better health, Stuebe says.A study analysis published in Maternal & Child Nutrition, of which Stuebe was a part of, found that for every 597 women who optimally breastfeed, one maternal or child death is prevented.However, thats on a population level. For an individual mother and her child, there are many, many things that contribute to her childs health in adolescence, of which breastfeeding is just one, Stuebe adds. If breastfeeding is extraordinarily difficult for that mom and baby, the struggle to make it work may not be worth it.The TakeawayWhilenursing isnt the golden ticket to a pre-baby body, it does burn calories and, paired with a healthy lifestyle and thoughtful nutrition plan, can help you slim down to your pre-pregnancy weight more quickly if youre careful. Just dont be overly restrictive when it comes to calories and the quality of your calories."

Full-Time Nurse and Mother of Two Loses 28 Pounds, Wins $500
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/full-time-nurse-and-mother-of-two-loses-28-pounds-wins-500,"Christine Adams lost 28 lbs. with 21 Day Fix, FOCUS T25, INSANITY MAX:30, and 21 Day Fix EXTREME fitness programs and the Beachbody Performance supplements. She entered her results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won the $500 Daily Prize for December 3rd!Christine is an Independent Beachbody Coach.Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?After my sons were born, I initially didnt care about my weight, because I knew that taking care of them was my priority. I also convinced myself that after I was finished pumping/breastfeeding, the weight would just fall off. Thats what everyone says(that breastfeeding helps you lose weight). I was still 10 lbs. away from my pre-pregnancy weight when I finished breastfeeding. Before I could find the motivation to start an exercise program, I gained 8 lbs. back. I was stressed out with having a four-year-old and one-year-old at home, and working full-time. I was sleep-deprived and irritable all the time. Overall, I was disgusted with the way that I looked. I had little energy, little confidence, and found myself avoiding going out, because I didnt like how clothes fit on me. I used I work full-time and have two young kids as an excuse for not being able to find the time to exercise. I took my frustrations out on my kids and husband, and all of my relationships suffered.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My husband followed a few accounts on Instagram, such as Born 2 Transform, and he shared inspiring stories and pictures of fit momswith me. For nearly a year, we kept following them and I told myself, When my son turns one, I will stop pumping and then I can make exercise a priority. I feared that my milk supply would decrease drastically if I started exercising too soon. It was also very difficult to schedule a workout time, because I spent 20-30 minutes pumping four to sixtimes a day, and I was always exhausted. After my son turned one, I still couldnt find the energy or motivation to exercise, and kept making excuses. So we tried Shakeology, which I loved. My husband signed up as a Coach for the 25 percent discount and the following month, he signed me up as a Coach under him.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?I was always my biggest challenge, standing in my own way. As an RN, I knew everything I needed to do to be healthy, but I wasnt practicing what I was teaching my patients. I made every excuse I could to rationalize my behavior and lifestyle. I wasnt happy with myself, and my negative attitude affected my relationships with my children, husband, and co-workers. When I accepted the Beachbody Challenge, I was able to change my mindset. Each day, I was surrounded by positive, like-minded people with similar goals who gave me daily motivation, inspiration, and accountability. I havent been happier or had this much energy since my senior year of high school (I lost 30 lbs. the summer before senior year). The personal development and positive mindset has made me a better mother, co-worker, and wife. I feel like I can achieve anything I set my mind to. My upline Coaches and team have helped me become a better version of me  not just physically, but mentally and spiritually as well.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?21 Day Fix: I loved the portion-control containers and nutrition guide. It really put into perspective the amount of food my body needed versusthe amount of food I was consuming. I loved the variety of different exercises and that they were only 30 minutes! FOCUS T25: I loved that I didnt need any equipment, just my body. Each workout was challenging and only 25 minutes! I also love Shaun Ts phrases and style of motivation. INSANITY MAX:30: I loved the challenge and competition I had with myself to try and beat my time from the previous week. Every single workout was challenging, and Shaun T always knows what to say to push you to reach your max. This was the hardest program I have ever done but also my favorite, because overcoming the greatest struggle is what makes everything worth it and makes it the greatest accomplishment. 21 Day Fix EXTREME: Again, I loved the focus on nutrition, clean eating, and portion control. Ilove the Fixate cookbook. The 21 Day Fix Eating Planhas helped me to make a complete lifestyle change!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?In just five short months, I went from a size eight jeans to a size zero. Ihad to go and find my bin of clothes from high school (2004). I can complete an entire INSANITY MAX:30 cardio challenge without having to stop or modify.Before starting 21 Day Fix, I would get short of breath after fiveminutes of cardio, and at times would start wheezing and need to use an inhaler. I can do push-ups unmodified and in sets of 20! I can do chin-ups for the first time ever in my life! I have abs visible abs without even flexing! I went from 29 percent to 20percentbody fat! I never thought that any of this was achievable for me.But I am in better shape now after having two kids in three years than I have ever been before in my life.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I havent been happier, more confident, purpose-driven, or energized since my senior year of high school (2004). I start each day with scripture readings, 30 minutes of exercise, and at least 10 minutes of audio personal development while driving to work. My marriage and relationships with my kids and co-workers are flourishing, and my mindset has completely changed. From May 2014 to February 2015, I had been applying and interviewing for a new job, and kept getting let down. I eventually told myself that if I saw another posting, I wouldnt even apply anymorebut after completing my first challenge in April 2015, my mindset and confidence skyrocketed! I applied for the sixth time, interviewed for the fourthtime on the same day my husband reached the milestone of Diamond Coach, and found out one week later that I finally got the job. Attitude and mindset areeverything!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?I started my first program (21Day Fix) in a Challenge Group with my Coach (my husband), my mother-in-law, and my sister-in-law. Every time someone posted a motivational quote or picture of a post-workout selfie, it motivated me to do the same and go work out if I hadnt already done so that day. With so much positive energy going around, it was impossible not to reach my goals. It was also helpful to see them post about their struggles and setbacks, because it let me know that Im not alone. As more and more people (mostly close friends, family, and co-workers) joined each Challenge Group, the motivation grew exponentially, and I was able to reach my weight-loss goals even sooner than expected. It was even more amazing knowing that I had the support of close friends, co-workers, and family, because these were the people I spent most of my time with. In order to be successful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I needed to be constantly surrounded by like-minded people with similar goals.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach is my husband, and he has always pushed me to be better. Seeing how his mindset changed from the interactions he was having with his upline Coach and team was very inspiring. All the personal development he was doing made him a better father and husband. In the beginning, I was very resistant to him being a Team Beachbody Coach, but witnessing how he helps change lives, mine included, has made me fall in love with him all over again. We keep each other accountable and support each other. Even though I have reached my weight-loss goals and he hasnt yet, he still tells me every day about how proud he is of me and how I inspire him.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?Shakeology: I regret not trying Shakeology three years ago when I first did two rounds of INSANITY. I have so much more energy since drinking Shakeology daily. I also used to eat 10 or more fun-sized pieces of chocolate threeto fourdays a week while at work.But since starting Shakeology, I no longer have sweet tooth cravings and have not eaten chocolate bars since Easter. E&E/R&R: I would not have been able to wake up at 4:45 a.m. and push through the last month of FOCUS T25 and the first month of INSANITY MAX:30 without this pre- and post-workout formula. I regret not using this when I first did INSANITY in 2012, because the results came so much faster compared to when I wasnt using it. Energize & Recover: I started using these in month two of INSANITY MAX:30. I definitely needed Energize to complete such an intense workout at 5 a.m., and Recover helped to reduce muscle soreness. P90X Protein Bars: These were essential for my mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. They kept me full and tasted like a cheat meal.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you have?The only health condition I have ever had is childhood asthma. I hadnt experienced any episodes of wheezing for over 10 years, but it resurfaced within the first few months after my sons were born, when I first attempted to exercise. Since my first round of 21Day Fix, I have not had any more problems with wheezing.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Transformation Tuesday: Faith Lost 33 Pounds with Beachbody!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-faith-lost-33-pounds-with-beachbody,"After giving birth to her second child, Faith B. was looking for a way to lose her post-baby weight. She had a tough time with her weight after her first child, and she didnt want to have the same difficulties this time. Tired of feeling self-conscious of her body, she saw a sign to try Beachbody programs. She triedFOCUS T25andPiYoand lost 33 pounds and 19.5 inches in just 7 months! Read her story in her own words below:In November 2014, I had my second child. I gained 50 pounds with my second pregnancy and the weight seemed to be falling off at first, but I started to notice it coming back. I became very depressed and didnt want to look in the mirror.I was so angry at myself for gaining that much weight.The worst part of my day was putting on my clothes and nothing fitting. I wouldnt even let my husband see me change because I was so ashamed.When I was breastfeeding my son at all hours of the night, I noticed the FOCUS T25 commercial. It must have been a sign because for over a week straight, my son woke up when it came on, and I kept watching it.I finally brought it up to my husband that I needed to do something, and I believed this was it!When it came, I started. I couldnt believe how fast and hard it was at first. I didnt know how to lunge or do squats, so I had to modify. Slowly but surely, I got better and started to see the weight drop.I felt better and I was smiling.After FOCUS T25, I got PiYo with VeganShakeology!I was never the yoga type, but Chalene kicks your butt!I felt my muscles getting stronger and it was challenging! I started to see results in about 3 or 4 days with the amount of sweat that was happening. Not only thatbutPiYos workouts really did just helpme to be aware of my body more and with my posture, which is something Ive always struggled with.You can change your life, too.

(Psst  the sprinkles are just for decoration.)These little nuggets of deliciousness are loaded with healthy vitamins, minerals, and fiber, but yet, theyre still super yummy. The batch lasted in our office oh, maybe five minutes.A quick rundown on their nutritional benefits: A single serving ( cup, cooked) of rolled oats (not quick-cooking oats) contains 8 percent of your daily recommendation for fiber and 6 percent for iron. Medjool dates are a rich source of key vitamins and minerals like potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamin B6. Almonds and almond butter are good sources of vitamin E, which can help fight and prevent cell damage with its antioxidant properties. A quarter cup of these powerful little nuts has more than 7 g of protein, which will keep you feeling full  and full of energy. A banana adds natural sweetness and even more potassium, which your body needs to help it perform essential functions. Finish it all off with a splash of pure vanilla extract and Vanilla Shakeology.

How to Overcome 12 Common Weight-Loss Obstacles
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/how-to-overcome-12-common-weight-loss-obstacles,"Whether youd like to drop five pounds or 50, it can feel like there are a million weight-loss obstacles standing in your way.Losing weight isnt always easy, and there might be many mental, logistical, and lifestyle factors to overcome to reach your goal. But dont despair: You can shed those stubborn pounds with a little soul-searching (do I really hate cauliflower?) and some practical tips (wait, I can roast cauliflower?? This is SO GOOD!).To maximize your chances of success, start by taking a few minutes to identify your biggest obstacles to losing weightand see how you can overcome them. Here are 12 of the most common ones that get in the way of losing weight.(And check out these dramatic Before and After stories if you need proof and inspiration!)Diet ObstaclesObstacle: You dont have time to cook.Solution: Do some prep work.No one is denying that its easier to order takeout than it is to make something from scratch. But cooking healthy meals doesnt have to be a major time-suck. Some tasty options  like a main course salad  dont even require any cooking at all. The key is to think about what youll eat long before your tummy starts rumbling.Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, CFT, a dietitian, personal trainer, and co-author of The Nutrition Twins Veggie Cure, suggests taking some time over the weekend to plan out your meals for the following week, stock up on ingredients, and chop up some veggies and protein so youll be in good shape when you peek into the fridge after a long day at work.Obstacle: You hate being hungry.Solution: Load up on low-calorie, filling foods.Surprise: You dont have to eat tiny amounts food to lose weight. In fact, youre better off not depriving yourself or you might end up backsliding pretty quickly.The best way to feel full  and lose weight  is to fill up on a combo of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and lean protein, says Lakatos Shames. [Processed or simple] carbs by themselves will give you energy, but youll come crashing down soon after because you dont have any protein and fiber to slow down digestion.Shes also a fan of keeping lots of non-starchy veggies on hand, like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and squash. Drizzle on flavorful vinegars and spices to make them more interesting. Or roast them so they caramelize and taste sweet, she suggests. Not only are they filled with loads of nutrition (vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients), the fiber and water will help fill you up.Obstacle: You dont like the taste of healthy food.Solution: Be patient and keep trying new things.First of all, you may not really know what good, nutritious food tastes like. (Hint: Its not plain, flavorless chicken and limp, over-cooked veggies.) Watch a healthy cooking show to learn the basics and experiment with some new recipes. Need some ideas? You can find a slew of options right here.But if you just dont think anything will taste good unless its deep-fried and loaded with salt or sugar, be patient. As you build out your recipe repertoire and try new things, youll find foods that you enjoy, and even ones that dont seem appealing right now might eventually become your favorites.Pro tip: Use healthy spices to boost the taste and flavors in your dishes to point your tastebuds in the right direction.Obstacle: You think nutritious food is too expensive.Solution: Make smart choices.Spendy organic produce is great, but its not essential for good health or weight loss, says Lakatos Shames. Try to shop for whats in-season  its almost always cheaper  and remember that frozen vegetables and fruit are usually as nutritious as their fresh counterparts.Lakatos Shames also advises clients on a budget to eat more vegetarian- and plant-based protein while limiting expensive items, like meat.And if you think that fast-food combo meal is cheaper than a healthy salad, think again. Research suggests that staying fit and healthy could save you cold, hard cash in health-related expenses down the road.And even in the short-term, losing weight can be cost-effective if you want it to be, says Holly Lucille, ND, RN, a Los Angeles-based naturopathic physician and CrossFit coach. Not going out to dinner as often and drinking less wine are pretty good ways to save some money, she says.Fitness ObstaclesObstacle: You think exercise is boring.Solution: Find something you love.If you consider your workout a chore, then youre doing the wrong workout. Finding a fun activity is really crucial if you want to stick with it long enough to lose the weight and keep it off.If running a treadmill is about as exciting to you as staring as a brick wall, dont do it. Experiment with other types of workouts until you find a good fit: Try a country line dancing class, kick some butt in a mixed-martial arts workout, or check out a yoga class; your options are endless!Obstacle: You dont have time to exercise.Solution: Find a workout that fits your schedule.Lack of time is one of the biggest barriers, but its also about making workouts a priority, says Lakatos Shames. Scheduling a time in your day like you would an appointment can help you do that.But if youre really time-strapped, make sure youre getting the most out of your sweat sessions. Choose a workout thats designed to yield major results quickly. Beachbodys Focus T25 and 22-Minute Hard Corps, for example, were created to get you an hours worth of results in less than half an hour.Both programs also employ high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which helps you burn more calories every minute compared to steady-state exercise. You also keep burning more calories for days afterward: By varying your intensity level  you get your heart rate up and down and up and down again you increase post-exercise oxygen consumption, so you end up burning calories long after youve finished your workout, says Lucille.Obstacle: You push yourself too hard, too often.Solution: Make recovery a priority.Walking your dog around the block may get your heart pumping a little, but its rarely enough to help you lose weight. Likewise, its easy to go overboard, and some people end up hitting fitness plateaus because they dont ever give their bodies the time they need to recover from all of the intense exercise theyre doing.Allowing adequate time for recovery is extremely important, says Lucille. When Im forced to rest a little and then go back to the gym, my speed and efficiency ends up being better.But before you get too excited, recovery doesnt equal lying on the couch all day with the remote. There is a difference between rest and recovery days; on rest days, youll want to focus on getting sleep and replenishing your energy stores. On recovery days, you can still work out, but to a lesser degree. Try a gentle yoga routine from Beachbodys 3 Week Yoga Retreat, or these full-body stretches.Its important for your body to be challenged by doing something its not already used to, says Lucille.Obstacle: You rely on workouts to do it all.Solution: Understand that exercise is just part of the puzzle.While exercise can definitely help you lose weight, you cant expect results if you focus on fitness while ignoring bad eating habits. Research shows that people who start a healthy diet AND a workout program at the same time are more likely to be doing both a year later.In my experience, Id say weight loss is about 60 percent diet and 40 percent exercise, says Lucille.Obstacle: Your joints ache.Solution: Go low-impact.Whether youre recovering from an injury or have a chronic issue, its hard to move when youre in pain. Assuming you have your doctors OK, try stepping up your activity just a little bit, and focus on low-impact exercise, says Lakatos Shames.Any movement at all is better than sitting on the couch, and even spending 30 minutes on an exercise bike or swimming may help you lose weight if you were pretty sedentary before, she explains.Emotional ObstaclesObstacle: Youre just not that motivated.Solution: Set short- and long-term goals.Theres a reason why its often easier to lose weight before a wedding or school reunion. But those types of motivators tend to be fleeting, and before you know it those 10 pounds (or more) are back on.Setting a long-term, non-scale goal  say, to avoid health issues that a parent or grandparent has  will help, but youll probably need some extra targets to shoot for along the way.I once lost weight mainly by challenging myself to do a certain number of push-ups every day until I could do 100, says Lucille. Some people find that getting competitive  perhaps by signing up for a series of challenging events, like a marathon, or 5K  keeps them invested in staying fit.Obstacle: Youre embarrassed by your failed attempts.Solution: Let it go, rethink, and reboot.Lots of people try to lose weight and repeatedly fail, and they end up beating themselves up for it.If that sounds like you, Lucille suggests nixing shame and blame by doing a 21-day autopsy  spend five minutes each night reviewing your habits and thinking about what went right (and what didnt) that day, and try not to make any harsh judgments.The goal is to eventually have an a-ha moment that enables you to stop feeling guilty and instead focus on moving forward.Obstacle: Your willpower disappears in the face of temptation.Solution: Plan your defense.Sometimes it might seem like the entire world is out to sabotage your weight-loss efforts. Try to think ahead and predict where diet traps may arise so you can be ready with a healthy snack or distraction.Pro tip: Dont go hungry where temptation lurks (were looking at you, happy hour and office birthdays). Have a small nibble or a healthy shake beforehand and youll be more apt to resist unhealthy treats.Obstacles are made to be overcome, so add these solutions to your weight-loss toolbox and watch those pounds drop off, slow and steady."

Before long, your weight-loss habits will become second-nature, not to mention totally worth the extra effort.Read on for 11 easy tips for losing weight on a busy schedule!1. Meal Prep Every WeekMeal prep doesnt just save time and energy, its also key to ensuring you stay on track with your nutrition goals.Every Sunday, block off a couple hours to make a weekly meal plan, go grocery shopping, and hunker down in the kitchen to chop, dice, grill, and plan your meals for the week.If you dont want to cook entire meals in advance, you can still cut down the steps by setting aside ingredients and chopping vegetables and fruit ahead of time.

I like to make crustless muffin-size quiches and freeze the extra portions so I [always] have healthy meals on hand, says Gorin.Proper portion sizes are a key part of meal prepping for weight loss: Using portion-control containers is an easy way to make sure your meals are balanced, especially if youre trying to lose weight for the first time.Not sure where to start?

Store Healthy Snacks in Your Desk and BagThe key to resisting that mid-morning muffin craving at work is to have satisfying, nutrient-rich snacks at the ready.Store snacks in your bag and at your desk, says Gorin. This way, youre not relying on whatevers available at the corner market or vending machine. For protein-rich snacks, try hard-boiled eggs, beef jerky, or edamame. For snacks under 200 calories, bring in some pistachios, roasted chickpeas, or seaweed.3. Drink More WaterResearch suggests that drinking water before a meal can help you feel more full. An easy way to check that off your list is to carry a reusable water bottle with you at all times. Refill it regularly and aim to drink half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces each day.If youre notoriously bad at hydrating, here are 25 easy ways to drink more water.4. Keep Fruit in Plain SightWhen youre at home, keep fruit on the countertop, says Gorin. Research shows you may be more likely to reach for it if its visible. A Cornell University study found that women who had a fruit bowl out weighed 13 pounds less than women who had cereal or sodas sitting on their kitchen counter.Same goes at work: Skip the candy bowl and get a basket and load it with your favorite fruits. Try apples for a hit of fiber, or bananas to sneak in some potassium, and pears for a sweet, low-calorie snack. And dont forget about seasonal options like grapefruit, oranges, and kiwis.5. Make Your Workouts ConsistentAlthough diet plays a major role in losing weight, pairing it with regular exercise is critical if you want to achieve weight-loss success.But how do you squeeze in a sweat session when your day is jam-packed? I recommend working out in the morning before people start making demands of you and life has a chance to get in the way, says Trevor Thieme, C.S.C.S., Beachbodys fitness and nutrition content manager.If mornings are out of the question  maybe you have a long commute or an early drop-off time for your kids  identify another time of day thats consistently free of commitments. For some people, that might be during lunch. For others, it might be after work. Whenever it is, reserve it for exercise.Working out at home is a good way to make sure you get your workout in  and its harder to make excuses! With a streaming service like Beachbody On Demand, youll have hundreds of workouts with nutrition guides, calendars, and progress trackers at your fingertips.6. Eat at a Table (*no phones allowed)Instead of snacking as you scroll through emails or eating dinner while bingeing on Netflix, walk away from the screens and sit down at a table. (Novel concept, right?!)Youre probably thinking, How exactly will sitting help me lose weight?! Well, pay attention to this fun fact: Research shows youre more likely to consume greater amounts of food if you eat while youre distracted.While it might seem counterintuitive to carve out 30 minutes just to eat when you could multitask, a 2001 study suggests that multitasking may actually decrease your productivity by as much as 40 percent.In addition, paying attention to your food  chewing slowly and savoring flavors  doesnt just help you appreciate your meal, it also makes it easier to recognize the signals your body sends you about whether youre full or not.This practice of mindful eating can help you lose weight, but even better than that, it can also help you keep the pounds off once youve slimmed down.7. Swap Cardio for Strength TrainingStrength training trumps traditional cardio (think: long slow distance) when it comes to losing the right kind of weight: fat.But the most effective method is to combine cardio and strength training by doing high-intensity circuits sets of several exercises performed back-to-back with little or no rest in between, says Thieme. Not only will you burn tons of calories during your workout, but youll also raise your metabolism for more than 48 hours afterward.Heres another advantage of such such workouts: They double down on the benefits of both aerobic and strength training in half the time of a typical cardio or weightlifting session. If youve ever tried a program like P90X3, 22 Minute Hard Corps, or INSANITY MAX:30, you know that a half hour is all it takes to get in a killer total-body workout, Thieme says.8. Share Your FoodWhether youre at an office birthday party, on a date, or out to dinner with friends, youll inevitably encounter temptations in the form of chocolate and/or salty, carb-heavy sides.If you want to (and can!) avoid these foods altogether, great. If, on the other hand, you want to enjoy a bite or two every once in a while, go for it. The key to sticking with your nutrition goals is not to deprive yourself, but to be sensible about how much you indulge.Split your desserts or sides with someone else to cut down on the calories. You know what [the dessert] tastes like, and the first bite or two is always the best, anyway, Gorin says.9. Have Emergency Food on HandOn particularly chaotic weeks, sometimes meal prepping just doesnt happen. And even if you have plenty of healthy ingredients on hand, sometimes you dont have the patience or energy to cook.Thats why Gorin recommends stocking your pantry and desk drawers with quick and easy emergency food, like cans of low-sodium soup, canned tuna packed in water, canned low-sodium beans, and whole-grain crackers. There are healthy packaged food options out there; just make sure to check the ingredient list.10. Move MoreThe most successful weight loss plans entail not just eating more healthfully and exercising more intensely, but also moving more throughout the day, says Thieme. Your goal: To keep your metabolism humming in a higher gear during more of the 23- and a half hours you arent working up a sweat.For most people, thats going to require thinking outside the box/gym. If you sit in an office all day, take a three to 10-minute break every hour to walk around the building or perform squats and arm rolls at your desk. Instead of sending emails to people down the hall (or even on different floors), pay them a visit. If you have a phone call with a client or an in-person meeting with co-workers, skip the conference room and talk as you walk.And dont limit this sort of creative thinking to your workplace. Do calf raises while brushing your teeth, stretch and foam roll while you watch TV, take your dog for a walk as you chat on the phone  do anything you can to spend more time on your feet and less time on your rump.11. Rethink Your BeveragesA full day of commitments and responsibilities usually requires a boost (or two or three) of caffeine to make it through. But the rich, sugary coffee beverages most people rely on (think pumpkin spice lattes) have no nutritional value.Instead of sipping half your daily calories through a green plastic straw, Gorin suggests taking a walk to get a refill of water or hot tea. That might reset your mood and your commitment to healthy eating. If you do have a cup of coffee, says Gorin, swap the creamer for milk and sweeten it with a sprinkle of cinnamon instead of sugar.Achieving your goal of losing weight doesnt mean you have to make a bunch of huge, life-altering changes all at once. Sometimes all it takes is making smaller, smarter choices throughout your day to get you moving in the right direction."

Denise and David Beast Up Together
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/denise-and-david-beast-up-together,"If roses and candy dont cut it when you think about showing your partner how much you care, what about starting to work out together? Think about it youll get to spend some quality time together every day, helping and supporting each other to reach goals, while you get healthy and improve your lives together. Not to mention the physical improvements youre both sure to see in each other! Thats what Denise and David did together, they took on Body Beast and saw improvements in themselves and their family really quickly. After they completed the program, they competed in the Beachbody Classic together. Read on for their story, in their own words:Denise: I felt insecure because my skin was sagging and flabby. I wore Spanxevery day, even if it was just to go to the supermarket. It affected my marriage and my friendships because I wasnt myself anymore. I still had a mom body skinny legs and arms with a kangaroo belly pouch. I knew I had to step up my game by strength training with Body Beast if I truly wanted to change my physique.Itwas my idea to start. I purchased the program in 2014 and did one complete round by myself before I forced him to join me.Hewas suffering from back problems after years of running, and I got tired of watching him feel sorry for himself. I told him, You need this in your life, and thankfully, he trusted me enough to give it a shot.David:We set a goal and wrote it down; it was to win the Beachbody Classic. Then we did Body Beast together on the same schedule so we always knew where we were on a daily basis. This helped us to stay focused and motivated. We woke up with a plan, did the workouts,and it was good because we did not let each other slack off.Denise:Daveand I knew that if we were going to do this, we had to do it right, starting with wakingup at 4:30 AM each morning to work out together so the kids had us both available when they got home from school. Following the Body Beast calendar, nutrition guide, and Sagis competition prep was vital.Nomatter what got in the way  birthday parties, family BBQs, holidays  it didnt matter, he was there right by my side going through it right along with me and I love my husband more today than ever before.David:I couldnt believe how much my body changed in such a short amount of time. It was the first time I ate for the gains and I followed themeal plan as closely as possible. I started to feel strong and I was filling out my clothes better.I was so proud of Denise because she impressed me with how she was able to go heavier with her lifts and do more push-ups.David:To go through this process of working out, eating right, and preparing for the competition alone would be very difficult. Doing it all together helped because we went through the same struggles together. We knew how the other was feeling when we had to cut carbs and do extra cardio and drink gallons of water and apply the self-tanning oils and practice posing routines. It was also important that we were realwith each other. Its helpful when your spouse tells you what you needto hear as opposed to what you wantto hear. Denise helped me make the corrections I needed in my diet and posingto become better.Denise:Knowingthat hes right there to give me those words of encouragement when I feel like giving up is the reason Ive been able to get this far in my fitness level.David:Thebest part of the Classic last year was being able to walk on stage together holding hands. Walking through the tunnel up to the stage I thought about all those workouts, all that sweat and struggle. I thought about all those meals we prepped together and endless hours of practicing; then to walk out on stage together and show the crowd how we accomplished getting into the best shape of our lives was a truly amazing moment for me.David:Ifeel it helped us to communicate better and become a stronger team. Since we were on the same path, we made a pact to get the kids ready in the morning together. While one parent made the breakfast and got the snacks together, the other was brushing hair and getting them dressed. This helped us to be more efficient with our time and allowed us to get more done. We also ate a lot of the same meals, of course in different portions, but it helped us take the guesswork out of what to eat every day.Denise:DoingBody Beast together has brought us so much closer. We cook and plan meals together, talk about our goals, and since Ive gained so much confidence the intimacy has never been better.Denise:Inthis day and age where everything is processed and no one pays attention to serving sizes, we take pride in knowing that our children see mommy and daddy exercising at home and cooking healthy meals every single day. Ourhope is that this lifestyle becomes normal and the kids can say its just what we do,because I have to admit, I didnt see that growing up and it took a lot of effort for me to get to this point.David:I would encourage other couples to work out together. There is an experience that happens during the workouts that is almost indescribable. When youworkout alone, you may allow yourself to cheat on a rep or two, or take extra breaks. When you workout with your spouse and you set a goal together, you dont let the other slow down, or take that break, or cheat on a rep. This is the one occasion where you dont get in trouble for yelling at your spouse. (Come on! You got this! Keep going! I dont stop, so you dont stop!) You push one another to the max and the bond that is created through that process is better than any weekend getaway or vacation!When as a couple, you can unite on a common goal and organize your life around accomplishing that goal, you realize so many things about yourself and your relationship. You start to see how creating those habits of planning the workouts, the meals, and going through the pains and struggles together forces you to rely on each other for support. It has created a special bondfor us, a story that we can be proud to tell and continue to write every day.Denise:Werepreparing for our second trip to the Classic stage as we speak. And guess what our go to program is? Thats right Body Beast!Icannot stress enough how Body Beast has improved my marriage. It came into our lives when we needed it the most.Itnot only helped us improve our physical appearance, it showed us how to get through difficult times by pushing our limitations and cheering each other on.Alot of married couples tend to forget about each other, especially after having children. Working out together is something I encourage every couple to do. Theres a new bonding experience and shortly thereafter, the intimacy improves because theyre experiencing something together.Congratulations to Dave and Denise for setting a goal together, working toward it together, and then standing on stage and competing together! If youve got the workout-buddy-bug and want some tips on how to best work out with your partner, check out these five tips by Todd and Michelle, whoalso completed Body Beast together."

INSANITY Results: Andrew Lost 130 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/insanity-results-andrew-lost-130-pounds,"Andrew Eckman, age 30, lost 130 lbs. with INSANITY. He entered his results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I have always battled my weight. In high school, I hit the weights pretty hard, and I was around 240 poundswhen I graduated. I always tried to stay bulked up for football. Twelveyears passed by and I found myself up to nearly 340 pounds and hated everything about my body. I was in a size 44 pants and a 3XL shirt (and these were starting to get too small). I always had a desire to get fit, but just couldnt get the motivation to do it. I had tried 100 different times, succeeded a few of the times, but then just put the weight back on, plus more, a few months into it. I was concerned about getting high blood pressure and sleep apnea, and was literally embarrassed by my size.3What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?It was in November of 2015 that I decided to make a change. I had just turned 29, and I told my wife that I wanted to be in the best shape of my life on my 30th birthday, which was October 26, 2016. Many things inspired me to make this change. I wanted to be healthier for my family, and even more for myself. Ive always been the active type, and I was to the point where I didnt want to do anything but sit on the couch. The day it hit me like a ton of bricks was a fall day last year. Im a high school teacher and head high school basketball coach. I had taken my students to a theme park for a school trip. We waited in line for about 45 minutes to get on a rollercoaster. When weget to our turn to get on, I sit down and try to buckle the strap. It wont go around me, and I have to get off in front of hundredsof people. I was humiliated and hated myself for allowing myself to get this big. I decided that day that it was time to make a change!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My biggest challenge was motivation. I didnt want to do anything but lie on the couch. When I popped in that DVD of INSANITY, I thought, There is no way! I did the fit test, and I thought I was going to die! Day after day I continued to put the DVD in, and I pushed myself to keep doing it. It was tough, but I made myself do it. I was inspired by Shaun T, and wanted to keep working to try and get the body that I had always dreamed of. This program pushes you hard, makes you sweat, and you see results. I couldnt be happier being 130 pounds lighter and leaner than Ive ever been. I turned 30 just a few days ago, and I am in the best shape of my life! I reached my goal thanks to INSANITY!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I really enjoy the intense exercising. After I am done with my workout, I am pouring sweat, my muscles are burning, and I feel good about myself! I feel like I get a good workout in every time I do it! It pushes me each and every day!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?My weight loss is the biggest thing that I am proud of. I was downright fat before this! I am also proud of the muscle I have gained too! I feel like I am leaner than I have ever been. It has taken a lot of work and discipline, but it is definitely worth it!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My life is completely different. I am actually proud of my body instead of being embarrassed of it. Before, I was embarrassed to take my shirt off in front of my wife. I have the best wife in the world, and she always has shown me more love every day, no matter my size. She has supported me through this journey, and allows me time to get my workout in and prepare my meals each day. I want to continue to try and be the best husband and father that I can be, and I know this weight loss will help me do that.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.

The Beginner’s Guide to Losing Weight With Beachbody
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/the-beginners-guide-to-losing-weight-with-beachbody,"My name is Rebecca and I love cheese. Im also a digital marketing professional, freelance writer, wife, dog mom of two, and I drive 70 miles round-trip to work every day. So you could say Im a little busy.A year ago, I was a weight-loss newbie, but even I know that fad diets dont work. Sure, you can go on a kale-and-quinoa bender to drop pounds fast, but you cant keep that going forever. Getting  and staying  healthy and fit is about a lifestyle change, not Im not eating carbs this month!So Im here to tell you about that time I lost weight with Beachbodys 21 Day Fix and more importantly, how I didnt have to give up my life cheese.I found out first-hand why 21 Day Fix and all of Beachbodys programs work: They help you lose weight and get in shape now AND give you the tools to stay that way for good.How I Got StartedLast year, I was getting ready for my wedding. I didnt have a huge amount of weight to lose, but I did want to get toned for the dress. Id never seriously tried to lose weight before; the most I had accomplished was meandering around the gym a few times.So, of course, I started eating lots of salad and taking a few classes at the gym. Done and done, right? Well, I did see a slight change, but I really had no idea what I was doing. I needed structure and a plan that would fit into my crazy-busy schedule: Enter 21 Day Fix.The first step was making myself a priority. I made a deal with myself: Get serious for 21 days and if the program didnt work, then Id never do it again.How it WorkedI followed the meal plan to a T, worked out every single day for 21 days (yes, that actually happened), and felt absolutely awesome.I loved the physical results, but 21 days of eating clean and focusing on my own health did amazing things for my mind. I was more motivated at work, felt great in jeans, and I was happier in general. And the most important part  I ate cheese almost every day.After one round of the program at 100 percent and two more rounds at 80/20 (80 percent eating clean, 20 percent eating what I wanted), I lost four inches and nine pounds, which looked more like 15. During those three months, I drank margs in Mexico, ate late-night chicken fingers in Tahoe, celebrated friends birthdays with pizza, and all the fun things I didnt want to give up.Thats why the 21 Day Fix works  its about making sustainable changes in how you eat, not a crash diet with temporary results. You can get the body you wantand eat your cheese, too. If youre ready to lose weight the right way  and keep it off  heres all the info you need to get started.What IS Beachbody?Youre probably thinking, Hmm, isnt that the company with the infomercials? Yep, thats the one.But heres what you probably didnt know: Beachbody is a fitness, nutrition, and weight-loss company thats been around since 1998. It has produced more than 400 workout programs with Super Trainers like Tony Horton, Shaun T, and Autumn Calabrese.Its the company that created fitness and nutrition programs like P90X, INSANITY, CORE DE FORCE, and of course, 21 Day Fix. Its also the birthplace of Shakeology, the Beachbody Performance line, and my favorite, Beachbody On Demand, an online streaming platform.Its changed millions of lives with a huge selection of health and fitness solutions for real people with real lives, and real affinities for eating blocks of cheddar at midnight (like me).How Do I Lose Weight With 21 Day Fix?The concept is simple: Eat right and work out. But I could just do that myself, you might say. Okay, then why arent you doing it? Because its much easier said than done.This program takes a seemingly simple concept and provides you with two key tools:1. A portion-controlled eating plan to lose weight.2. Challenging and doable 30-minute workouts to get fit.The Weight-Loss Eating PlanIt all starts with a set of color-coded containers that tell you how much fruits, veggies, fats, protein, and carbs you should eat every day for your specific daily calorie target.I refuse to count calories, but Im all about counting colorful containers with food inside of them. And the best thing is that its real food that you choose. Hate quinoa and kale? Dont eat them. The 21 Day Fix program comes with a list of approved foods that will satisfy all palates. (Plus, you can put wine in the yellow containers. Just saying.)The Workout PlanThe 30-minute workouts provide the perfect combination of cardio and strength training to build muscle and burn fat in 21-day intervals. Whether youve never worked out a day in your life or you live in the gym, these workouts are safe and challenging for all fitness levels.When I started, I could barely do three push-ups on my knees. By the end, I was doing a full minute of traditional push-ups and couldnt stop flexing my guns in the mirror.What Is Beachbody On Demand?Its exactly what it sounds like: Streaming workouts from your laptop, tablet, TV, or mobile device. Think Netflix, but for fitness and nutrition.Even better, you can get an annual membership for $99.95 (less than $10 a month) that includes access to every single program Beachbody has ever created. You also get access to any new programs, and theyre always coming out with more. Thats 500+ workouts and counting.In just one week, you can do cardio, weight training, yoga, mixed martial arts, dance, tai chi, and a Pilates/yoga combo all in your living room or wherever you like to work out. Thats $100/month less than it costs for a gym or studio class membership.Pro tip: Not so nimble in the kitchen? You can also stream Autumn Calabreses FIXATE cooking show, and learn how to make clean, portion-controlled meals.What Programs Are Right for Me?Beachbody has a huge library of programs, and if you dont know which one to do first, theres program match tool that will help you find the one(s) that work for you. Want to build muscle? Try Body Beast or 22 Minute Hard Corps. Prefer to dance off the weight? Work out to CIZE or Country Heat. Just select a category that matches your goal or interests  cardio, muscle building, yoga, low impact, dance, etc.  then pick a program from the list and go!All the workouts are designed by certified fitness pros and all the nutrition programs are created by nutrition experts. Each program can produce dramatic results, but results dont happen without hard work. Take it one program at a time  this isnt a race, its the start of a healthier lifestyle."

Transformation Tuesday: Michael Lost 102 Pounds With FOCUS T25
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/focus-t25-results,"Michael lost 102 pounds and 12 inches after committing to FOCUS T25 for 52 weeks! Ashamed of his body and lack of endurance, he decided to start working out for himself and his children. Heres what he has to say about his journey.My story begins in the summer of 2013. I started to feel ashamed of myself when I was at an amusement park celebrating my sons 5th birthday. I wasnt allowed down a waterslide because I was too big. My son was crying because I couldnt go down with him, and there was a line of frustrated people behind us. After that, I kept falling into a deep depression. I continued eating and smoking cigarettes. Having to purchase clothing at the big and tall section was embarrassing.One night while channel surfing I stumbled upon the FOCUS T25 infomercial. Seeing all the transformations was getting me emotional. Finally, I decided that I was going to start working out. My goal, just like most people, was to lose weight.Did I regret starting FOCUS T25? Not one bit! I was shocked that I completed the Alpha Phase because I was never consistent with anything positive in my life. After completing the Beta Phase I felt like I wanted to take on the world. I felt amazing! I felt stronger and younger. Interval training of just 25 minutes is so much more effective than running on a treadmill for an hour!Before, I was in no shape at all. I was round and could barely breathe. Now, Im in the best shape of my life! Im down 102 pounds! I am filled with energy, stamina, and endurance. I feel confident wherever I go and am able to shop at regular sections at department stores. No more Big and Tall clothes for me!Not only has Beachbody saved my life, but it has inspired me to be a coach for my sons soccer team. Also, it has taught me to be disciplined, to stick with a workout program, and finish it. Ive applied this same concept to my work and personal lives and it has made me a better person!Results vary based on starting point and effort.<hr /><strong>You can change your life, too.

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/creative-ways-to-use-ice-cube-trays,"Chances are youve only used ice cube trays to freeze water, and thats cool, but this under-utilized kitchen tool has a lot more potential when it comes to healthy eating and reducing food waste.Not only can you use ice cube trays to capture ingredients at their freshest (adios, powdered garlic) but you can also use them as a portioning tool as most hold about one tablespoon per well. Ready to get freezing?Here are 10 smart ways to fully appreciate your ice cube trays.1. PestoDont let homemade pesto go to waste. Instead, freeze it into individual ice cube-sized portions. Once the pesto fully freezes, pop out the cubes and store them in an air-tight bag or container to free up the tray. Then, when a pasta dish, roasted vegetable, or egg recipe calls for pesto, simply pop the frozen cube into a pan to defrost it.2. Tomato pasteAs luck would have it, many recipes call for just a tablespoon or two of tomato paste. Instead of tossing whats left over or freezing it in a big chunk in the can, separate the extra paste into individual portions. Coat an ice cube tray with non-stick spray and scoop one tablespoon of tomato paste into each well. Use the cubes as needed to add flavor and depth to soups, sauces, and casseroles.3. HerbsTired of using dried herbs when a recipe calls for the fresh version? Freeze fresh basil, cilantro, parsley, mint, and other herbs. Fill an ice cube tray about three quarters of the way with chopped herbs, then cover with water, oil, or broth. While the herbs appearance will change, their flavor will not.4. Minced garlic or gingerTheres nothing fun about chopping up garlic and ginger every time you want to add aromatics to a dish. The next time a recipe calls for ginger or garlic, chop the whole garlic bulb or ginger root, and freeze whatever you doing use in an ice cube tray. Most recipes dont call for large amounts of these ingredients, so consider using a smaller tray to create smaller portions. Add some oil or water to the well so the chopped pieces bind together. Once frozen, store the cubes in an air-tight bag or container in the freezer. Incorporate the flavorful cubes into soups, stews, and veggie dishes.5. Lemon and lime juice and zestFresh lemons and limes are great, until they sit in the fridge too long and dry out. Squeeze out the juice when the citrus fruits are fresh, and then freeze it in an ice cube tray. Use the cubes in main dishes, or use them to flavor cocktails, water, and seltzer. You can also save the zest of the citrus fruits, by filling the ice cube well with the shredded rind and adding a bit of the juice to hold it together.6. CoffeeTo prevent the buzzkill that is diluted coffee, freeze cooled, freshly-brewed coffee into cubes. Toss them into home-brewed iced coffee for a morning glass of Joe that wont get watered down by regular ice.7. WineThe same principle applies here: Watered-down wine (or warm white wine for that matter) isnt exactly ideal. Avoid diluting your vino by using wine cubes, or add frozen wine cubes to homemade sangria.8. EggsBought too many eggs? Freeze them before they go bad. Scramble whole eggs or egg whites, then freeze in an ice cube tray. When its time to use them, take out as many cubes as you need, thaw them in a refrigerator, and cook them up as soon as they have defrosted.9. No-bake energy bitesFor a healthy snack or a not-too-filling breakfast before a morning workout, opt for no-bake energy balls. Whip up a batch, like these birthday cakeorcarrot cake energy balls, and freeze the leftovers into an ice cube tray. This will help them last longer, and theyll be a cold and refreshing treat thats easy to take on the go. However, the calories will be slightly different than those in the recipes if the portion size isnt the same.10. Single-serve dessertsNeed a little something to satisfy your sweet tooth? Freeze single-serve desserts, such as peanut butter cups and no-bake cookies into separate wells based on the recipes serving size. Before dinner, pop one out and let it defrost a bit in the refrigerator while you eat, then enjoy it after your meal is over. Bonus: Because the dessert stays in the freezer, itll be out of sight and out of mind.Have you ever used your ice cube tray to freeze foods? Let us know in the comment section below!"

Four Kinds of Cycling Workouts (and Why You Should Be Doing All of Them)
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/performance-sports-science/four-kinds-of-cycling-workouts-and-why-you-should-be-doing-all-of-them,"Serious cyclists are creatures of habit. We religiously get up before sunrise, hit the head, chug a cup of Joe, throw on our kit, and head out for a group ride. The route and pace are almost always the same: Twenty to 40 miles (longer on weekends) at a pace that works up a sweat but doesnt interfere with friendly conversations and griping about cars.If youre one of those dedicated dawn patrollers, we salute you. By constantly rising to the occasion, you consistently pack in more exercise before breakfast than most Americans do, well, ever. But we can also tell you that, in all likelihood, that daily, unchanging group ride is holding you back. Why? Because if youre only logging miles, youll never reach your full athletic potential.Whether you ride to race or simply to improve overall fitness, that congenial morning coffee ride occasionally needs to be turned into a double espresso, handlebar-chewing throw down. No matter what your talent or goal, the path to improvement always involves changing things up, says Ron Peterson, a USA Cycling certified coach and owner of Peterson Training, in Redondo Beach, California. When you constantly stress your body the same way, it eventually stops adapting and progress stagnates.The four workouts in this article will help prevent that from happening. In addition to injecting critical variety into your training program, each type of workoutfrom a one-hour tempo ride to a 30-minute interval sessionwill help you develop a different skill that can help you not only nail a new PR, but also build a leaner, faster, more powerful body. But first things firstbefore you jump into the workouts, you need to figure out two key variables: Your training objective and the training intensity that will guide each workout. So lets get to it.STEP 1: Identify Your GoalAre you riding to become a stronger competitor or to improve overall fitness? The answer to that question will determine how often you perform each type of workout detailed in Step 3 (long slow distance, tempo, sweet spot, and short interval). Whether its a road race, gran fondo, century, bike tour, or dropping 15 pounds by your next birthdayset a goal that can be marked down on a calendar, says Peterson. Then give yourself at least four months to achieve it.If your goal is to improve fitness During your first two months, do a couple of long slow distance rides each week along with a tempo workout and a couple of strength training sessions (yes, even endurance-minded folks should pump iron). In month three, swap a weekly strength session for a sweet spot workout. In month four, change things up even more: Do one tempo ride, one sweet spot workout, one short interval session, one long distance ride, and one strength-training workout each week.If your goal is to become a stronger competitor During your first two months of your off season, focus on building your basea couple of two-hour rides and one or two strength training sessions during the week, and a couple of three-hour rides on weekends (or longer if you dont have to take your kid to an afternoon soccer game). In month three, start tailoring your training to your cycling niche. Climbers should aim for two sweet spot workouts and two recovery (read: easy LSD) rides each week, adding a short interval workout to the mix when youre four weeks out from race day. Sprinters should focus on speed work. Do two short-interval workouts per week, along with one tempo or sweet spot workout, and two recovery rides. Both groups should also continue to do at least one strength training session per week.Step 2: Test YourselfTo perform your workouts effectively, youll need to determine one of two key training metrics for gauging exercise intensity: Lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR) or functional threshold power (FTP).Contrary to popular belief, lactate (sometimes referred to mistakenly as lactic acid) isnt the cause of that deep muscle burn you feel late in a race or toward the end of a grueling workout. Its a buffering agent that helps neutralize the hydrogen ions that accumulate in muscles during aerobic (oxygen fueled) energy production. The buildup of those ions is what causes acidosis (AKA the burn).Your lactate threshold is the point at which you begin producing more hydrogen ions than you can effectively neutralize, and your LTHR represents the exercise intensity (in beats per minute) that will cause you to reach that point. Threshold power is essentially the same point of no return, but its identified in watts instead of beats per minute. The maximum power that a cyclist can sustain for one hour is his or her FTP.To determine your LTHR youll need a heart rate monitor, preferably in the form of a chest strap, which is typically more accurate than a wrist-based biometric sensor (i.e., the kind integrated into a watch). To determine FTP youll need a power meter, which attaches to your bike. You can use either metric (LTHR or FTP) to gauge exercise intensity, but elite cyclists generally prefer FTP because it tends to be more accurate. But whichever metric you choose, the test remains the same: Pop your bike in a trainer or find a stretch of road with a slight uphill and no stops that takes at least 30 minutes to ascend. Warm up for 15 minutes at an easy pace, and then ride for 30 minutes at a pace that that challenges you to complete the ride. If youre wearing a heart rate monitor, average your heart rate from the final 20 minutes to determine your LTHR. If youre using a power meter, average your power from the full 30 minutes, and then multiply that number by .95 to determine your FTP. Re-test yourself every three weeksas you become fitter, your LTHR and FTP will inch higher.Step 3: Begin TrainingYouve determined your goal, identified a training plan, and figured out your LTHR or FTP. Now the fun begins. Add the following workouts to your training schedule as described in Step 1.Workout 1: Long Slow DistanceIntensity: 65 to 84 percent of LTHR, 55 to 75 percent of FTPDuration: Two to three hoursPurpose: To develop raw enduranceThe first phase of any smart periodized training plan (i.e., one divided into blocks that focus on specific goals or skills) is to build or reinforce a strong aerobic base. So regardless of whether youre a noob or a veteran, youre going to spend a couple of months doing long slow distance (LSD), also commonly referred to as foundation or base miles.The goal is to increase the amount of work your body can do before becoming fatigued, says Peterson. Youre teaching your body to use fat [instead of glucose] as its go-to fuel source, and thats huge.Huge because, for all intents and purposes, your body has an almost limitless supply of fateven if youre an elite competitor. That makes it a preferable fuel to glucose, which is easier to burn, but stored in more limited quantities. But to access fat as fuel, and to teach your body to burn blubber more efficiently, your heart rate needs to stay out of the red (lactate threshold) zone.Keep your pace conversational, advises Peterson. If you find it difficult to speak more than a sentence or two at a time, dial it back. You should be peddling hard enough to work up a sweat, but not so hard that talking becomes difficult.Workout 2: Tempo RideIntensity: 85 to 91 percent of LTHR, 75 to 84 percent of FTPDuration: One hourPurpose: To increase your capacity for high-intensity effort (i.e., go harder for longer)Often described as sustainable discomfort, tempo pace is the hardest intensity you can sustain for one hour while remaining aerobic (i.e., producing energy from glucose or fat in the presence of oxygen). The goal is to condition your body to perform for prolonged periods at intensities that approach your lactate threshold.Although beneficial during any phase of training, tempo rides are particularly important toward the end of the base-building phase, says Peterson, as they help prepare your body for the transition from straight LSD to training that includes shorter, harder speed work (i.e., intervals). You can either do a tempo session at the end of an LSD ride (simply ramp up your pace during the last hour), or perform a dedicated, hour-long tempo workout. Either way, its important that you perform the ride with as few interruptions as possible. Youre teaching your body to sustain high-intensity effort; this is no time to rest.Workout 3: Sweet Spot TrainingIntensity: 91 to 95 percent of LTHR, 85 to 90 percent of FTPDuration: About an hourPurpose: To increase both endurance and functional threshold powerEfforts between tempo pace and lactate threshold fall into what coaches refer to as the sweet spot, as training in this zone (usually in the form of long intervals) provides an ideal balance of intensity and volume for increasing that most critical of performance metrics: Functional threshold power. In short, sweet spot training (SST) helps increase the speed and power you can sustain during high intensity exercise. I am a big fan of the sweet spot, says Peterson. You get a lot of bang for your buck, and its nowhere near as fatiguing as training at threshold.Pick a stretch of road thats flat or has a steady 3 to 5 percent grade. Do three 15-minute intervals at the intensity mentioned above, recovering at an easy cadence for seven to eight minutes between each one. The interval pace should be hard enough so that talking becomes nearly impossible, says Peterson. About 10 beats below your threshold heart rate.Workout 4: Short IntervalsIntensity: 95 to 105 percent of LTHR, 91 to 120 percent of FTPDuration: 30 MinutesPurpose: To improve aerobic capacity, cellular energy production, power generation, endurance, stamina (exercise tolerance), and speedWelcome to the red zone. For this workout, youre going to exercise above your lactate threshold, and its going to burn like hell. If it were a CrossFit class, youd learn to embrace the suck.Most cyclists can only peddle for five-minute stretches at the intensity required for these intervals, and then kaboomout go the lights. But the pain is worth the payoff: New riders can improve their VO2-max (the maximum amount of oxygen their bodies can utilize during intense efforts), and experienced riders can boost their power and speed when operating at their lactate threshold. Whats more, all levels of cyclist can improve endurance. Indeed, short, intense interval workouts can increase raw endurance just as much as long distance rides, according to a study in the Journal of Physiology.If your primary goal is to lose weight, the benefits of interval training are just as enticing, as research shows it can it help you lose more body fat than with steady state cardio.So how do you go about reaping these rewards? Perform two to four intervals, each of which should encompass four minutes of hard effort (at the intensity mentioned above) and four minutes of active rest, during which you bring your cadence down to that of a leisurely ride.Youll get the greatest benefit if you peddle as hard as you can, recover, and then do the next one just as hard, says Peterson. In short, dont skimp on rest. If you dont recover sufficiently between intervals, your training effect (i.e., your adaptations from exercise) will be diminished. Indeed, being smart about how you perform each workout is just as important as incorporating all of them into your training program."

How to Cope with Emotional Eating
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-cope-with-emotional-eating,"How many times have you eaten not because you were physically hungry, but because you were stressed, tired, bored, anxious, angry, or (insert appropriate emotion here)?Many of us have been taught that food can soothe a mood, that shoveling scoops of Ben & Jerrys straight out of the pint can help dull the ache of a breakup. Comfort food  those warm, salty, melty bites of mac and cheese, for instance  preys upon our inability to say no thanks when we seek a reward or feel stressed.When we use food to appease our moods, it sets us up for a vicious cycle of possible weight gain, followed by self-recrimination, followed by more emotional eating. But, I want to assure you that you can and you will stop this cycle if you learn a few simple tools.Are You An Emotional Eater?How do you know if youre eating for emotional reasons? Try this self-test. For the following Answer each of the following five questions with a simple yes or no.Do you eat between meals even when youre not physically hungry?If you eat between meals, are you eating on auto-pilot  i.e., mindlessly and without complete awareness and attention to what youre actually doing?When something upsetting happens, do you reach for the nearest bag of cookies to make yourself feel better?Do you fantasize about foods that are your special treats such as chocolate cake or kettle chips?When you eat these treats, do you hide out and eat them by yourself because youre embarrassed to eat them in front of others?If you answered yes to more than two of the above, you may be an emotional eater. When you want to eat when youre not physically hungry, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and ask yourself:What am I feeling and why?What do I really need besides food right now? (Hint: Its often rest or a break from what youre doing)The healthy alternatives offered below may help you begin to escape the cycle.Three of the Emotional States That Lead to Emotional EatingSadness, anxiety, and anger are the three emotional states I see most often among my patients that can lead to bouts of emotional eating. Some people eat to celebrate (hello, birthday cake), to quell boredom (think mindless snacking while watching TV), to reward themselves (I just ran 7 miles, so I can eat a fully-loaded cheeseburger and fries), but when it comes to patterns of emotional eating, I see them stem most from sadness, anxiety, or anger.Sad EatingLets face it: When heartbreak or loneliness hits, eating that tub of ice cream seems like a good idea. A bit of sweetness to drown out the sorrow Before you know it, youre caught in a self-perpetuating negative cycle that can be very difficult to escape. You eat because youre sad, then you feel even more blue because youve eaten so much. This can lead to a what-the-heck attitude, increasing the likelihood of overeating when the next bout of the blues strikes.Healthy alternatives to sad eating:1. Express yourself: Your melancholy mood was probably caused by an upsetting incident. Get it off your chest by talking about it with someone you trust. If nobody is available to talk, try writing down your feelings.2. Move: Battle the blues by moving your body and getting your heart pumping. Even doing 30 minutes of moderate exercise can boost the feel-good chemicals in your brain.3. Give yourself permission to let it out: Light some candles, take a hot bath, listen to sad music, cry until you run out of tears. Allowing yourself to feel sad will help you process. Or, put on headphones, turn up the music, and dance, or punch pillows pick a constructive way to emote thats not eating.Anxious/Stress EatingMany of us eat to relieve our stress or anxiety. Research points out that emotional distress increases the intake of specific foods  in particular, those that are high in fat, sugar, or both. An excessive intake of these types of highly palatable foods shares similarities with the effects on brain and behavior that are seen with some drugs of abuse, according to research published in the journal Nutrition.Healthy alternatives to anxiety/stress eating:1. Stick to a regular, healthy sleep routine. If youre not sleeping well because youre stressed, the lack of sleep can result in poor food choices. Research shows that people who got insufficient sleep for several consecutive nights increased food intake to keep them going. When they returned to getting adequate rest, they stopped eating as much  particularly carbs and fats.2. Do something relaxing and calming. We all have different ways of relaxing. The next time you feel stressed and anxious and instinctively turn to food, resist the urge to run to the cupboard or fridge, and instead practice a relaxing activity. Consider trying meditation, yoga, or even just pause for a moment to take some deep breaths.Angry EatingUnfortunately when we stuff our anger down with food this doesnt get rid of our anger. It simply buries it. If we dont deal with the emotion, it will keep popping up.Healthy alternatives to angry eatingOne way to get out of the angry eating trap is to delay eating  even 10 minutes will do  and to sit down, take a deep breath, and tune into what youre really feeling. Ask yourself the following questions and patiently work your way through the answers.What happened today that may have made me angry?Why did that event stir up angry feelings?What do I need to do in order to let go of this anger and feel peaceful?"

How to Make Eating Right Feel Like Less of a Struggle
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-make-eating-right-feel-like-less-of-a-struggle,"Eating healthy can feel overwhelming and complicated and challenging.Low carb, organic, whole grains, gluten free, vegan, Paleo, low fat, keto, and eating for your body type all the options can make your head spin! You want something thats going to work, and you want it yesterday.The reality: Putting in the work to eat well requires a least a little bit of effort. Theres no one-size-fits-all approach to health; what might work great for some wont work for the next person. If some of the following healthy-eating struggles sound familiar, youre not alone. Well help you sort through the issues so you can find an individualized approach that works for you.7 Common Struggles On the Road to Eating HealthyYoure not sure how to eat healthy.If you didnt grow up eating a balanced diet with healthy foods, figuring out which foods are healthy and how to cook them can feel like a major roadblock.Youre not alone. When you start eating healthy, its normal to be concerned about whether or not food will taste good, how to cook it, or even what to buy at the grocery or order off the restaurant menu. Ease yourself in. Consider trying one new food a week or making just one or two healthy recipes your first few weeks. You may also want to start watching cooking shows or consider consulting with a registered dietitian to build your food confidence.Eating healthy is more expensive.You may have said or heard these comments before: Fresh fruits and veggies go bad so fast. Eating organic drains the pocket book. It all just seems so expensive.If you cant afford to buy all-organic produce, thats totally OK. Be selective about the ones you can shell out more for; the clean/dirty produce list can help guide you to discover what produce you should prioritize purchasing to suit you and your familys preferences. If you cant afford to buy organic at all, the clean/dirty produce list can help as well because at least you can make the majority of your non-organic produce purchases from the clean list.Buying in-season produce can also help you save money, and it tastes better. Frozen fruits and veggies can also be easier on the wallet, are just as healthy as fresh (theyre flash frozen at their peak of ripeness) and can help you cut down on food waste. Instead of crushed ice or cubes, use frozen fruit in smoothies. Instead of wilting raw spinach or kale leaves into soups, use boxes of frozen spinach or chopped frozen kale. Youre cooking the greens for a longer amount of time anyway, so you dont need the fresh-from-the-garden taste of raw greens.Ill admit, I will buy a lot of healthy convenience items, such as pre-chopped veggies and energy bars and while I may be paying a few more dollars at the check out line, this helps me to actually use the veggies before they go bad, and it saves time in the prep department. But, this is something I prioritize in my budget, as I have a toddler and not a lot of time to spend on food prep.You hate grocery shopping.Some people legitimately hate going to the grocery store. But good news theres an app for that. With the growing number of grocery delivery services  even Amazon has jumped on this gravy train with Prime Now  you can order on your phone or computer and schedule your groceries to be delivered at a time thats convenient for you. And there is evidence that shows preordering food may actually help you eat healthier.Unhealthy food marketing is inescapable.Scroll through Pinterest and youll see double stuffed cookie dough pie and slutty brownie bars swirled with marshmallows, all tempting us to feel like we need chocolate. We all know where the office candy jar is and where to find the box of donuts or cookies or birthday cake.Be the change you want to see. Provide a healthier solution and bring in a batch of homemade (and healthy shhh, dont advertise this, and see if anybody notices) Flourless Brownie Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Frosting for the next birthday celebration, or No-Bake Cinnamon Sugar Donut Holes to that next early morning meeting, or if you dont have time to whip up homemade snacks, stash these in your desk so that when your stomach growls, you wont head to the candy jar or vending machine.You feel like you dont have the time to eat healthy.Eating healthy might seem like it takes more time than running through the drive-thru. However, taking just one or two hours to meal prep on the weekend will save you rushing around to figure out breakfast, lunch, or dinner all week! Three cheers for less stress, right?Healthy meal planning is easier that it seems. Beachbodys meal plans provide a wealth of inspiration (including some meal plans that will set you up for five days of success and take less than 90 minutes from start to finish) and 21 Day Fix creator Autumn Calabrese and her brother chef Bobby Calabrese walk you through the basics of meal prep in a video from their new FIXATE cooking series.Youre afraid of trying a recipe that might fail.So you find a new recipe you want to try and then you cook it. Maybe you enjoy it, but all the kids (and the husband) turn up their noses. And you get a whole bunch of whining and complaining. Its tempting to want to throw in the towel and go back to the usual recipes you know they will enjoy.But stay the course! Try cooking foods in different ways. So you dont like raw onions well, try them caramelized. Dont like steamed broccoli? Try roasting it. The cooking method can greatly alter the taste of foods. Hint: All veggies taste better roasted.You have FOMO.The fear of missing out can be strong when all-or-nothing thinking creeps in, and you focus on what you sacrifice to eat healthy (instead of what you gain).But, eating well doesnt mean you have to be perfect  thats nonsense. Even those who eat healthy most of the time have their cheat meals. Thats why Beachbody supports a 80-20 strategy. Theres no missing out when you allow yourself to enjoy everything in moderation.Yes, you can still eat cheeseburgers and brownies, just not every day!Tell us your other struggles below and we will use them to come up with another article full of helpful tips!"

Stir potatoes, then continue roasting potatoes an additional 1015 minutes until golden brown and slightly crisp (about 35 minutes total).6. When cool, cutmeatloaf into six slices. In two food storage containers, placeone sliceof meatloaf and half of the cauliflower and green beans. Freeze the remaining meatloaf in individual portions for a future week.7. If you did not buy hard-boiled eggs, place six eggs in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.8.

Allow to cool, then refrigerate. Serve with twohard-boiled eggs.9. Next prep chicken for chicken salad lunches. Fill a large pot with water, and bring to a boil. Add 20 ounces of chicken breast; reduce heat to medium and simmer until chicken is cooked through. Drain water, thenuse two forks to shred chicken; set aside to cool. While chicken is cooking, dice 2 celery stalks and 1 red onion. Slice 3 cups grapes and 3 cups strawberries. (Reserve avocado to add just before serving.)10. In a large bowl, make Mason Jar Chicken Salad by tossing together  cup celery,  cup red onion, 12 ounces shredded chicken, 6 tablespoons Greek yogurt, the juice of one lemon, and 3 teaspoons extra virgin coconut oil.

6 Ways to Hit the Reset Button and Get Fit (Again)​
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/6-ways-to-hit-the-reset-button-and-get-fit-again%e2%80%8b,"Exercise or ice cream? Exercise or ice cream?But of course, ice cream.I havent worked out in a while. And the less I do, the less inclined I am to do so. But in my heart of hearts, I know the longer I dont exercise, the harder it feels to get back to it. But Im determined to do it. Especially since I know that if I want to get back on the health wagon, its all in my mind.Here are some mental reset tricks Ive used in the past that have worked for me. You may find they work for you too!6 Strategies for Getting Fit AgainThe past? What past? Sometimes it seems like the weight of all my sins  quite literally  are too much to bear. Most recently, it was the month of drinking (hey, it was my birthday!), followed by late-night snacking (ditto!) and morning hair of the dog (with the snacking, not the drinking). Just thinking about it makes me want to climb into bed and order UberEATS. But I have to to let go of my (overindulgent) past and start anew.But also, remember the past: Yes, it is a new day, but I do have a past. One where I was eating healthy, waking up early, exercising, and feeling good about all of it. If I take a few minutes to meditate, I can almost imagine myself back on my old schedule of healthy eating and working out. (i.e you want to forget your less-than-perfect past but not your angelic one.)Just put on your shoes: When I first started training for a marathon, one of the trainers told me an important trick: Just focus on the first step. So when I woke up groggy at 6:30 a.m. (why does it always have to be so early), I would think, Just put your on your shoes, you dont have to go anywhere. You can put on your shoes, cant you? I could. Id plunk my feet on the floor and lace up my shoes. With my shoes on, it was ridiculous to wear pajamas, so Id get dressed and ready. Just go outside, Id then tell myself. You dont have to go running, just stand on your porch. Of course, I would be dressed and standing on my porch, watching everyone else out and about. Might as well start running, Id think. (You wouldnt think this mind trick would work day after day. But it hasnt failed me yet.)Believe that healthy will become a habit: Some people form a habit in 21 days. For others, it may take longer. Recent research suggests it can take people anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a habit. The researchers found that, people are reassured to learn that doing the behavior gets progressively easier; so they only have to maintain their motivation until the habit forms. The journal found that working hard for 23 months on instilling a new behavior is attractive if those doing it know it has a chance of becoming second nature. And it does!The real trick to habit forming: Remove all obstacles. Shawn Anchor, happiness guru and author of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work says that by taking his guitar out of his closet and putting it on a stand in plain sight, he was able to make practice a daily habit (even though taking the guitar out of the closet only took an extra 20 seconds.)Thats why when I was running, I left my sneakers near my bed. Come summer, when I swim in the morning, I pack my goggles, swim cap, and towel the night before.Another example of this: In an experiment, Google put the M&Ms in their kitchens into opaque containers and put the healthier options in clear glass jars. They found that over a seven-week period, their 2,000-person New York office staff alone consumed 3.1 million fewer calories from M&Ms.Go easy on yourself: Its so easy to get into an all-or-nothing mindset, which is how I fell off the health wagon in the first place. Forgive yourself the ice cream. Health is not all or nothing. The addition of the healthy habits will soon outweigh the less-than-healthy ones and youll be back on the wagon in no time."

How to Breathe While Running
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/how-to-breathe-while-running,"Whether youre training for yourfirst 5Kor pounding the pavement for another 26.2 bumper sticker, one thing all runners have in common is oxygen. Breathing in and out is as natural as, well,breathing.When you go for a walk, you dont actively think about taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide; it just happens.So why does breathing feel more complicated when those legs get pumping? In the days when even aslow jogcan leave you panting like a dog, your internal dialogue says you must be doing something wrong.Turns out, you may be right.Breathing Basics for More Efficient RunningBefore you can get to the heart of better breathing, you should first understand why oxygen is so important not only to a runners lungs, but also to a runners muscles.Your muscles need oxygen in order to fire, says Bill Bishop, head coach and founder of ChicagosBishop Racing, who helps athletes achieve their competitive goals in running, swimming, cycling, and multi-sports. Your heart pumps blood, circulating it around the body and once oxygen enters the lungs, it passes through alveoli and into the blood, where its transported to muscle cells for use in cellular respiration, he explains.The harder you run, the more oxygen your muscles need, says Bishop. Going harder or faster may feel like a far-off goal, especially if youre more focused on simply not passing out. But the good news is that no matter what yourrunning goalsmay be, breathing better can get you there.2 Schools of Thought on BreathingDuring RunningThere are two main schools of thought when it comes to breathing and running: natural breathing and rhythmic breathing. Natural breathing is just as it sounds  breathing in a way that comes naturally to you.A lot of new runners have a tendency to overthink it and get so analytical about their breathing patterns that they dont actually just relax and breathe, says Bishop, who says this can lead to hyperventilating.Rhythmic breathing, on the other hand, relies on your natural inhales and exhales as a guide for foot strikes. The most common breathing rhythm of the well-trained runners Ive tested is a 2-2 rhythm, which means they take two steps while breathing in  one right foot step and one left foot step  and two steps breathing out, saysrunning coachJack Daniels, Ph.D., associate professor at A. T. Still University in Mesa, Arizona, and two-time Olympic medalist in the modern pentathlon.Another effective rhythm is the five count (3-2) breath, says Beachbodys fitness and nutrition content managerTrevor Thieme, C.S.C.S.The goal here is to avoid beginning each exhalation on the same foot, he says, adding that when you breathe out, your diaphragm and the muscles around it relax, reducing core stability. If you begin each exhalation on the same foot, youll concentrate the impact forces on one side of your body; if you begin each exhalation on a different foot, as you will with the 3-2 rhythm, youll distribute those forces equally between both sides of your body, reducing your overall risk of injury.The Best Breathing Style for YouWhile there are benefits to both styles of breathing, you wont know what works best for you until you give ita whirl.Runners may think they are most comfortable with one method without ever trying another method, says Albert Rizzo, M.D., senior medical advisor to the American Lung Association and section chief at the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in Newark, Delaware. There may be advantages to looking into different styles ofrhythmic runningrather than running without ever pacing yourself.While there are benefits to both styles of breathing, theres one common recommendation for all types of exercise breathing: Practice making your muscular diaphragm your primary breathing muscle, instead of your chest and neck muscles, which tend to be shallow and inefficient.4 Tips for OptimalBreathing for Running, and BeyondWhether natural or rhythmic is right for you, follow this expert advice to see results that leave you breathing a sigh of relief:Dont Overdo It:If yourenew to running, going out too hard and fast can set you back before you really get started. If you feel as though you cant catch your breath, slow down and walk it out. If youre really laboring, Rizzo recommends pursed-lip breathing, where your breathe in through the nose as if smelling the roses and then out through pursed lips as if blowing out birthday candles. This technique can often get you back into control and start to get rid of some of that panic setting in.Nose vs. Mouth:Studies at the University of Arizona showbreathing through your mouth when running maybe easiest for beginner runners, especially, when compared to breathing through only your nose or using both your nose and mouth. (However, if you suffer from asthma or you are running in colder climates, Rizzo says nose breathing can help filter, warm, and moisturize the air to make for easier breathing all around.)Change the Rhythm:Instead of a 2-2 or a 3-2 pace with rhythmic breathing, experiment with other patterns based on your workout and what feels best for your body. Daniels says, A slow rhythm 4-4, for instance, allows for larger breaths but fewer of them per minute. Keep it nice and steady.Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable:Like any new form of exercise, it takes a while for the body to feel OK. For newer runners, the first part of your runs are probably going to feel crappy, Bishop says with a laugh. Having a good handle on your breathing allows you to feel the least crappy in the phase when your body needs to get juiced up and ready to go. Sure enough, things will come around, and youll feel good at some point.Do You Suffer From Side Stitches?Side stitches are often a stabbing pain beneath your rib cage or along your side that comes during running and exercising. If you are familiar with the suddenside stitch,youre not alone: 70 percent of runners experienced this pain at least once during the 2014 year surveyed, according to research published in the New Zealand Journal of Medicine.While scientists have explored the reasons for the side stitch and found a number of potential causes  including excess gas and digestive issues, restriction of blood flow, and an imbalance of electrolytes  the jury is still out on the precise reason for this exercise-induced discomfort.To get relief, Bishop recommends easing the pain by either contracting your abdominals (try a bicycle crunch, for instance) or shift to short-fast inhales and longer exhales until the pain passes. Another option: Slow your pace, try applying firm pressure with your fingertips into the sore spot, and just wait it out."

Beachbody Results: Andrea Lost 155 Pounds!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-andrea-lost-155-pounds,"Andrea Barlow, age 31, lost 155 lbs with Beachbody fitness programs and the Beachbody Performance supplements. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $6,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?All of my life I felt like an outcast because of my weight. I felt limited in what I could do, wear, and where I could go. I felt ashamed of how I looked and avoided certain social situations like missing my senior prom because I was too ashamed to wear a dress. I avoided certain restaurants, movie theaters, and amusement parks in fear of not being able to fit into the seats. I felt helpless and hopeless when the day arrived that I couldnt fit into the drivers seat of my own car. I became very unhappy, sluggish, and short of breath every day. I was always on some kind of diet,continuously seeking for something to work; repeatedly losing the same 25-50 lbs. I felt as though it was impossible for someone like me with so much weight to lose, capable of sticking with something long enough to lose all of the weight. It was easier for me to deem my circumstances as final and believe that life was just meant to be riddled with obstacles and limitations.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?Every year we take our son to Christmas in Hershey Park for his birthday. I always occupied myself with taking pictures of him and his father, capturing all of the fun they were having together. On our way home from Kyles fourth birthday in Hershey, he asksMommy why dont you ever get on the rides with me like daddy does? I want to get on the rides with you too. I felt like I let my son down, and instead of responding with an answer that had another excuse. I told him Im sorry Mommy hasnt ever gotten on the rides with you, but next year I promise I will. The last day I spent trapped as my morbidly obese self, I sat in the room next to where my newborn daughter was sleeping, contemplating to end my life or not. I loved my family too much to leave them that way. In that moment I only had 2 choices; do nothing and continue to miss moments with my children, remaining miserable and trapped or do something about my situation once and for all. My family needed me to be stronger and healthier, and there was no reason I couldnt give them that other than doubt.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Ive battled an eating disorder since I was 13. Trapped in a vicious cycle of feeling unhappy, anxious and helpless; binging on a lot of food to quickly fill myself with pleasure, feeling guilty for overeating and then purging as a solution to feel better, leaving me to feel extremely depressed. Every tragedy, adversity, failure, bored, and stressful moment was my reason to binge eat. A decade of working as a CNA caused significant disk degeneration in my back. At 28 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. My feet were ridden with deep fissures making walking and standing debilitating.3 Beachbody workouts gave me a chance to break my vicious cycle by providing me an outlet to relieve stress. Everyday that I pushed play through my adversities, I learned how to be stronger mentally and in charge of my choices. I desperately needed the support provided by my Beachbody team to reach victories through adversity. My journey with Beachbody has taught me how to feel empowered and not powerless.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I had a very hectic schedule at times and working out at home was more convenient. 21 Day Fix helped me become successful at completing something since it only took 3 weeks to finish each round. The modified move options in 21 Day Fix made exercising at my heaviest less intimidating and doable. 21 Day Fix helped my back feel stronger to handle some of the more advanced programs. The Fix meal plan gave me structure in my unbalanced diet and helped me learn how to make smarter food choices. I began seeing food for what it could do for my body instead of how it could please me. In times of stress Body Beast helped me feel powerful again. 21 Day Fix EXTREME helped me push progress to a higher level by intensifying a lot of the moves I had been doing in 21 Day Fix. These programs helped me build consistency in my exercise routine; something I previously lacked.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I faced a lot of adversity during my journey and could have reciprocated with giving up and starting over like I always did before. When my hypothyroidism stalled progress I could have convinced myself the program wasnt working and gave up. When my infant daughter developed GI issues and surgery was a possibility I could have turned to my eating disorder to cope with stress. When my fiancs mom was hospitalized and diagnosed with end stage CHF and we had to renovate her home; discovering she became a hoarder, I could have turned to fast food and quit exercising. When my mom was rushed off for emergency surgery for a brain tumor, I could have used food to comfort my pain. I achieved losing 155 pounds through adversities that had the power to impede my journey. I did the hard through the hard. The mental and emotional strength I gained from using my program as an outlet to cope helped me break a lifetime of habits. The result is a new life, ability to overcome hardship, and achieve power over my life.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My life has been renewed. I dont go to bed wishing I would die in my sleep anymore. I go to bed feeling excited and accomplished. My life has become one thats filled with first time experiences. Im no longer trapped in what I cant do. I faced my fear of running on my third round of 21 Day Fix and ran my 1st 5k. I ran my 1st 10 mile race a year later, and am running my 1st half marathon this fall. Im on a mission to live limitless. These programs are giving me the fitness conditioning and mental stamina to achieve the athletic goals and dreams I have in place for myself. I fulfilled my sons promise to get on rides with him one year into my journey and never have to be excluded again. Im no longer afraid of life. I broke a lifetime of habits and my family broke habits in the process. I no longer let lifes storm wreak havoc on my circumstances, I became the storm and took control of my circumstances. I unearthed the athlete I always wished to become. I became the role model my children deserved.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?My first challenge group was for 21 Day Fix. The group helped me understand my program as I journeyed through the first round. I used the group as a place to keep myself on track, leaning on it for support during moments of temptation. There were times I began missing workouts and benefited from someone in the group calling me out because I hadnt checked in with my workouts. Seeing the consistency of others through their rounds inspired me to stay consistent and committed. I became consistent and confident enough in my program and routine that I went on to lead my own Challenge Groups as Coach. Leading Challenge Groups inspired me to become the strongest example I could be. I learned tips and tricks for faster food prep and meal planning from others in the group. I was able to get advice and support from multiple views which helped me see clearer solutions for my own situations. Challenge Groups became my safe haven to be 100% honest and 100% supported by others on the same mission.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey? From day one Krystle believed I would reach all of my goals. The times I felt like giving up, she reminded me what I was fighting for. She always knew when I needed a dose of encouragement or a dose of honesty and helped me see my habits and actions from a perspective that helped my personal growth exponentially. She always challenges me to keep striving to the next level and goal. She placed me into a team page thats purpose was to serve as an additional support community. That team support combined with hers became instrumental in my journey. When my mom was rushed off to surgery, I felt helpless again for the first time since the start of my journey. Krystle and the team were the anchor of support and encouragement I needed to get through my moms surgery and all the other adversities I faced. Support provided by her and the team became one of the reasons this time to get healthy was successful where my previous attempts had failed.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Initially I was afraid of doing Ultimate Reset. It ended up being one of my favorite programs. It helped me uncover the emotional connection I had with food. During the Reset I became efficient in food prep and saw the benefit in it. I discovered how certain foods provided increased energy and mental clarity. I discovered a lot of new foods I liked and some became staples post reset. Doing reset through Christmas time helped me find the joy in moments and not food. Ive been drinking Shakeology since February of 2015. After the first week of drinking it I noticed a significant difference in my energy levels, and reduction of cravings.2 I quit smoking April 2015, with intentions to free up money to afford Shakeology. I ended up saving money I didnt before because affording it forced me to see how costly some of my habits were.You can change your life, too.

Slow Cooker Banana Bread Oatmeal
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/slow-cooker-banana-bread-oatmeal,"Whoever said, Life is short. Eat dessert first, probably meant first thing in the morning. Right? Hmm. While birthday cake for breakfast might sound like the stuff of dreams, it certainly wont help you fit into your skinny jeans. And crashing out by 10 am because you havent had any protein or fiber is definitely more of a nightmare.Luckily, with this Slow Cooker Banana Bread Oatmeal, breakfast can taste like dessert while still being a wholesome and nutritious way to fuel your day. Its got all of the flavor of a luscious slice of banana bread, without the oily fat (or the extra smear of butter on top). Cinnamon, nutmeg, and three whole bananas give it authentic baked-in taste. Ground flax seeds give it extra nuttiness and a boost of fiber and healthy omega-3s. And, the best part is, this recipe cooks overnight and is ready to eat when you wake up!Its super simple to make. Just pour all of the ingredients into a slow cooker before you go to bed. In the morning, youll be able to fumble your way to the kitchen with your eyes half-closed by following the scent of freshly baked banana bread. All you need to do is spoon your serving into a bowl, top it with chopped walnuts, maple syrup, and almond milk, and your banana bread breakfast is ready to eat (or heat it up in the microwave if its been stored in the fridge).If youre one of those people who leaps out of bed at the first twinkle of the alarm, you might consider the additional, but worthwhile, step of toasting the walnuts youll sprinkle on your Banana Bread Oatmeal. Simply heat a dry pan on the stove and toss in the walnuts. Gently shake the pan as they cook, until the nuts smell well, nutty then immediately remove them from the heat. WARNING: Do not attempt to toast walnuts if you can barely remember your own name before a cup  make that two  of coffee. Nuts can go from delightfully toasted to charcoal in the blink of a (very sleepy) eye.Slow Cooker Banana Bread Oatmeal Total Time: 8 hrs. 10 min.Prep Time: 10 min.Cooking Time: NoneYield: 6 servings, about 3/4 cup eachIngredients:3 cups water4 cups unsweetened almond milk, divided use1 cup dry steel-cut oats3 large ripe bananas, mashed6 Tbsp. ground flaxseed1 tsp. ground cinnamon tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt) tsp. ground nutmeg cup pure maple syrup6 Tbsp. chopped raw walnutsPreparation:1.

Beachbody Results: Scott Lost 74 Pounds and Won $1,500
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-scott-lost-74-pounds-and-won-500,"Scott Henry, age 37, lost 74 lbs. with P90, P90X3, The Masters Hammer and Chisel, and the Beachbody Performance supplements. He entered his results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I was in a job that I hated, with hours that kept me isolated from my wife and young daughters. I had to give up on multiple avenues of working dream jobs in the sports industry, and I ate and drank to fill something that was missing. During my long nights at work, I would actually make plans of how and when I was going to end my life.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My wife began drinking Shakeology just after our oldest daughters third birthday, and she began to see immediate improvements. When I told her how distressed I was, she begged me to seek help. After consulting with a physician, I decided that getting my body right would be a major building block toward getting my mind right. I began working with P90, and immediately decided that Tony Horton is the guy Id like to be when I grow up.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?I struggle with a perfectionist nature, and the first several days of P90 were a struggle. I became annoyed with myself when I couldnt finish the entire session. Over time, however, those frustrations turned into goals. Tonys Do your best, forget the rest mantra became lodged in my mind, and I decided that finishing a whole session was simply the next hurdle. Then, it was finishing the whole thing without modification. Accomplishing those goals took longer than 90 days, but by acceptingmy limits, I never could have followed it up by completing P90X3 just a few months later!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?Tonys attitude, infectious enthusiasm, and willingness to take a moment to effectively demonstrate challenging maneuvers were all key factors in my enjoyment of not only P90, but P90X3 as well. If I couldnt keep up with the platoon on a particular move, my goal would be to finish one or two more reps in their time, with the eventual goal of keeping pace rep-for-rep.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Im back under 200 pounds for the first time in nearly a decade and wearing a pantsizeI havent worn since high school and I graduated in 1996. I can also carry around both of my daughters at once (ages 4 and 21 months, with a combined weight of 70 pounds). Let me tell youthat 70 pounds is much more fun to carry, at least until someone gets squirmy. Im seeing so much more definition in my core and my legs that my wife cant help but make comments when I walk around the house in shorts and no shirt.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I have a much more positive attitude in my work, with my kids, with my wife and were both in better shape to enjoy our quality time, if you know what I mean. Ive always been very temperamental, but Im so much more patient with everyone and everything. Theres a tremendous feeling of pride and confidence that comes with that achievement.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?The Challenge Groupstarted off well, until the Coach who was leading it abruptly went inactive. After that, participation dwindled to nothing, and I continued pushing through on my own.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Rachel was always the first one to give me a like or a comment when I posted a photo or video to Instagram and Facebook, and some of her various other friends would usually follow suit. It helped to know that others were taking note of my results.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?Shakeology was the gateway drug, so to speak. My wife and I both greatly notice improvements in our moods and energy levels when we drink our shakes regularly. Especially mood, as two young kids can sap ones patience in a hurry. Were actually quicker to get frustrated with the girls without shakes, and thats our sign that its time to pull out the blender. The Performance line has also been invaluable. Energize is essential, especially when we had to rise before 5 AM to get a workout in before taking our girls to daycare and trudging off to the day jobs. We could always tell when we ran out of Recover, because there was much more muscle soreness from a strenuous morning.Howdid a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you have?I would experience bouts of constipation that werent what Id call frequent. But since using Shakeology daily, those episodes are nearly nonexistent.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

What program are you committing to next?Results vary depending on starting point and effort."

The Definition of “Healthy” Foods Is Evolving — What You Need to Know
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/the-definition-of-healthy-foods-is-evolving-what-you-need-to-know,"Picture healthy food; what comes to mind? A farmers market stand brimming with organic fruits and vegetables? Maybe the health food section of your local grocery store stocked with granola, coconut oil, and almond milk. Perhaps you recall the trendy Washington Post article, No Food is Healthy. Not Even Kale., which proposed an interesting thought: Food is not healthy, cannot be healthy, and never will be healthy. We are healthy; food can only be nutritious.Semantics aside, healthy food means something different to everyone, but that shouldnt stop us from asking what it should mean for our individual health.How Were Taught Which Foods Are HealthyMost of us learn to judge a foods healthiness from the people around us. Mom, a teacher, a fit friend, and experts, like doctors and nutritionists, guide our opinions. This knowledge of food comes from a rich, but conflicting, body of science focused on nutrients. Science can help explain phenomena when we know what questions to ask and which nutrients to measure, but food is not just the sum of its nutrients. Its problematic to judge a foods healthiness simply by reading the nutrition label. Yet, we do it anyway.Is There an Official Definition for Healthy Food?Yes. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a food can only be marketed as healthy if each serving:Contains less than the threshold amount for total fat (Contains at least 10 percent of your daily value for vitamins A, C, calcium, iron, protein, or fiber.)By this definition, high-fat foods like almonds, avocados, and salmon would not make the cut, but Pop-Tarts would. Cue the outrage!Last year we saw the repercussions when KIND bar, beloved by many, got a slap on the wrist for labeling their products as healthy. But, in May 2016, the FDA changed its mind and told KIND that it could return to its original labeling. Confused yet? What you have to understand is that the FDAs definition was written in the 90s during a time when we as a nation focused on low-fat foods, and wondered how the French could eat all that butter and still stay skinny!Today, we find the above definition shaky because the science for healthy fats (e.g. monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, omega-3 fats, etc.) is becoming more widely accepted.To understand why we have guidelines that ignore the benefits of nuts, we have to step back in time.Fat: Friend or Foe?In the 1940s, heart disease was the leading cause of death in America and scientists and doctors were hot on the trail to find ways to prevent and treat this killer. They published large, epidemiological studies  like the Framingham Heart Study and Seven Country Study  following thousands of people over decades. By the 1960s, early findings suggested that eating a high-fat diet filled with saturated fat and cholesterol was linked to increased risk for heart disease. Respected organizations such as the American Heart Association (AHA) adopted a low-fat diet recommendation for people at risk for heart disease, but acknowledged no conclusive proof that heart attacks or strokes would be prevented by doing so.These low-fat diets, originally intended as a way to help protect against heart disease, became a popular path to follow for weight loss and overall health. Fear of being fat led to a fear of fat and had a huge impact on how Americans viewed their food. Butter-loving, beef-stew-slurping Americans were about to enter into three decades of the low-fat craze.The 80s and 90s featured toned Cindy Crawford, Jane Fonda, and hours of jazzercise. We dug into Jell-O cups, munched on bagels smeared with reduced-fat cream cheese, and downed non-fat milk. After all, healthy food contained low, or better yet no, amounts of fat. (Remember, this era birthed Olestra-fried, fat-free potato chips, whose side effects included cramps, gas, and loose bowels.)Fast forward to the new millennium, when Americans were fretting over the Y2K bug in addition to heart disease, which kept its place as the leading cause of death. Adding lower-fat foods into the diet didnt seem to help. In fact, the rate of obesity doubled between 1980 and 2003, by which time one third of Americans had a body mass index that classified them as obese.Is Sugar the New Fat?These days, the low-fat trend has quieted, and there are signs that its reversing. Many experts are leaping off the blame fat bandwagon and recommending that we eat more avocados, nuts, salmon, and even egg yolks  all sources of healthy fats. For example, when the 2015 Dietary Guidelines were revised, the upper limit on total fat consumption was absent. In its scientific report on the 2015 Dietary Guidelines, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion noted, reducing total fat (replacing total fat with overall carbohydrates) does not lower CVD (cardiovascular disease) risk.Today, heart disease is still the leading killer, about 70 percent of Americans are overweight or obese, and type 2 diabetes is on the rise. In order to make low-fat and nonfat products taste good, many food companies replaced fat with sugar.Highly-processed carbohydrates (e.g. sweetened cereals, cookies, white bread) and sugary beverages are the new focus. The AHAs current standing recommendation is to limit added sugar to no more than 6 teaspoons for women and 9 teaspoons for men. The World Health Organization suggests lower is better, if possible.To give you some real-world context: A 12-ounce can of cola contains about 37 grams or 9.25 teaspoons of added sugar  more than what a typical male should have in one day by the AHAs recommendations.Even more shocking: A 2009 study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that of 85,451 consumer packaged foods purchased in the US, 74 percent contained added sugar.The TakeawayThis year, the FDA announced it would revise the definition of healthy on food labeling to keep up with evolving nutrition science; this is good news for everyone. The definition for what we consider healthy is still evolving, and its easy and exciting to get swept up in the latest changes in nutrition science.But, I would argue that its equally (if not more) important to focus on what hasnt. Eating a minimally processed, mostly plant-based diet centered on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is time-tested advice not even grandma will argue with. Instead of boiling it down to nutrients, judge your food as a whole."

What Happens to Your Body When You Overeat?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-overeat,"Eating more than your body needs over and over again is the best strategy for weight gain. Rocket science? Of course not. Most Americans have figured out how to tip the scales with 70 percent now falling into the overweight or obese categories. But what happens inside your body when you overeat?Lets suppose its FriYAY. And we all know that that means. its time to let loose and relax! For some that means spending the night out on the town, raising glasses then swinging by the drive-thru to satisfy the munchies. Others may stay in and curl up with their love to watch a movie, order takeout, and share a pint of ice cream. In either scenario, all too often, relaxation = overindulging in food.If you spend many of your weekends this way, you could be binging more than you realize. Add in those extra slices of pizza on Tuesday, two (or six) cookies at that office birthday celebration, and mindless snacking in front of the TV on Thursday, and youre eating more than you need on the regs.How the Body Reacts to Too Much FoodThe moment that you set your eyes on or smell food, your digestive system begins working and preparing to eat by releasing the enzymes and hormones that break down food. During the digestion process, food moves from the mouth to the esophagus to the stomach to the small intestine to the large intestine. The pancreas and liver contribute digestive juices to help with the breakdown and absorption of nutrients. The National Institutes of Health breaks the process down further in this article.When you overeat, here are a few of the things that can happen to your body:The stomach swells. When you eat too much, the stomach expands like a balloon to accommodate the large amount of food, which then pushes against the other organs in your body and makes you feel like you need to loosen your pants.You start feeling bloated and gassy. Every time you swallow food, air gets into the digestive track, and that gas expands in the stomach, making it feel bloated. This sensation is exacerbated if you consume carbonated beverages with your meal. Burping is a common side effect of eating too much food, because the build up of gas needs to be released somehow.Heartburn starts to set in. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid to break down food, and, if you overeat, this may lead to a back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn (the more food you eat, the more acids needed to break down the food). You may be more prone to heartburn if youre over consuming foods that take longer to digest like greasy cheeseburgers and beer.Excess calories are stored. As food moves through your digestive tract and into the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed, the liver and the pancreas begin to secrete enzymes to digest fats, carbs, and proteins. Cells in the intestinal walls absorb these macronutrients, along with vitamins and minerals, to be used for energy or storage. Excess calories that cannot be used for energy are stored as fat.Organs work overtime. Digesting a massive meal requires the organs to work in overdrive, secreting extra hormones and enzymes to break down the food. When this happens on the regular, issues can start to happen with metabolism and endocrine function, like insulin resistance, increased cortisol, and reduction in growth hormone.You may feel drowsy and tired. As the pancreas releases the hormone insulin, it sends off a cascade of hormones to be released. Serotonin and melatonin, the feel good hormones, are released. This may make you feel tired and content.You feel nauseated. Leptin, a hormone that is produced by the fat cells, tells the brain that youre no longer hungry and need to stop eating. If you eat too fast, you may miss this signal and continue eating past the feeling of fullness, causing the body to produce more leptin. People that have more fat cells in their bodies may develop leptin resistance, making it even harder to recognize fullness, and, ultimately, lose weight."

Everything You Need to Know About Rosé Wine
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rose-wine,"Move over white wine. Ros wine has taken its place as my new go-to (in moderation, of course) on hot summer days. And speaking of hot, ros has taken the food world by storm.Check out Instagram, food blogs, and pretty much any lifestyle website and everythings coming up ross: ros slushies, ros ice cubes, ros gummy bears, ros popsicles  you get the picture. You can make an endless number of treats with this gorgeous wine. But first, a lesson in ros then stay tuned for four unique recipes that use the pink potion.What Is Ros Wine?Ros wines are made from the same grapes as reds, but ross can range in color from super-pigmented magenta to golden copper. The color depends on two things: the type of grapes that were used and how long the skins were soaked in the juice.Some grapes have a thicker skin, and this is what imparts a richer color. For ros wines, the skins are left in the juice for about 1224 hours. For red wines, the skins can sit with the juice for up to three weeks, whereas for white wines, the skin spends no time in contact with the juice.Provence is Frances oldest wine-making region, and was also the first region in the world to make ros. According to Vins de Provence, in the early days of winemaking, all red wines were pale, closer in color to ros wines. This is because the winemaking technique of macerating  leaving the grape juice in contact with the skins before pressing  had not yet been developed.With only a few exceptions, all juice from grapes, despite the color of the skin, is clear. (Teinturier grapes, which have red flesh, are the only ones that produce red juice.) In those early days, the grapes were pressed and the color-extracting skins were removed relatively quickly, leaving what weve adopted today as ros.Chef David Rotter, the culinary mind behind New York Citys Boulton & Watt and Forest Point restaurants, recommends pairing ros with crudo or ceviche, because the bright quality of the wine pairs well with fish. But Rotter doesnt recommend cooking with ros. The flavor tends to burn off while cooking because [ross] do not have enough body, in comparison with reds and whites, he says.Ros Isnt Just for Drinking AnymoreThough drinking ros is certainly the most common way to enjoy the wine, there are many other ways to enjoy it. Two of the hottest ros trends are frozen ros (also called fros) and ros-infused gummy bears.James Beard nominee Chef Sam Mason, the owner/chef of OddFellows Ice Cream Co. in New York, agrees. He loves to cook with ros, but by cooking he means with a glass of ros in hand, rather than [in] the sauce pan.Mason does, however, blend up the most scrumptious ros popsicles youll ever taste. The pops are easy to make: dry, non-sparkling ros, a little water and some sugar, and locust bean gum (a natural thickener). Mason serves them upside down in a cup filled with sparkling ros to further expand the flavor and texture.How to Shop for Ros WineSome of the most delicious ros wines are at the wallet-friendly $1015 price point. Ros is a wine of pleasure, meant to be enjoyed on a hot summer day, not a grand emotional experience, says award-winning sommelier Michael Madrigale, formerly of Chef Daniel Bouluds Bar Boulud. When choosing a bottle, Madrigale suggests going by the color: Ros bottles are usually clear, so you can see the color, which is usually a pretty good indicator of the style.Do you like a super crisp, dry, and bright wine? Then look for one thats pale pink, preferably from Provence, the birthplace of ros. In fact, the village of Tavel in Provence makes only ros wine, and is known worldwide for making some of the best.Do you prefer fruitier wines with a rounder mouth feel? Try a ros from California, where grapes bask in the sun, and grow bigger and juicier than their European cousins. These wines range in color because there are so many varieties of grapes used in California wine-making, but these ross tend to be a medium pink color.If you like your wine spicy and fruity, go for an Italian rosato or a Spanish rosado. These tend to be a darker pink.Want to try your hand at a few rose recipes? Here are four that feature the drink as a primary ingredient.Ros Slushie (Fros)Total Time: 7 hrs. 35 min.Prep Time: 15 min.Cooking Time: 5 min.Yield: 6 servings, about 6 fl. oz. eachIngredients1 (750-ml.) bottle ros wine (full-bodied) cup water8 to 10 large strawberries, cut into quarters cup fresh raspberries (about 3 oz.)3 large thyme sprigs5 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice tsp. liquid stevia (optional)1 to 2 cups crushed ice (optional)Preparation1.

P90 Results: Air Force Vet Loses 50 Pounds, Wins $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/p90-results-air-force-vet-loses-50-pounds-wins-1000,"Jeff Pritchett, age 50, lost 38 lbs in 5.5 months with P90 and Shakeology. He entered his results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?After I retired from the United States Air Force in 2008, I didnt have anyone telling me what to do in the area of fitness, and I let my body decline. My weight shot up to 230 pounds. My physical activity involved getting out of bed and sitting at my computer all day, or watching TV. I felt tired all the time, and struggled with back and knee pain. I felt hopeless for any chance of reversing my condition. I knew what I should do, but felt there was no way I could ever be able to start, maintain, or complete any weight-loss or exercise program. In fact, I felt my days were seriously numbered, and it made me sick to think of my 3-year-old daughter growing up without a daddy.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?It took more than just a single thing to inspire me to change my life. First, it was the reality No, the probability, that I might never see my daughters 18th birthday if I continued down the path I was on. Second was my own 50th birthday rapidly approaching. The thought of being in the same physical and mental state when I turned 50, absolutely terrified me! With a little more than 30 days until I hit the big five-o, my wife and I jumped in with both feet! We found an accountability group, adopted a healthy eating plan, and made the life commitment to be healthy and fit as a team!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The greatest challenges I think everyone faces are finding motivation, having accountability, getting instruction, carving out time, and maintaining consistency. My greatest challenge was a combination of all of these. This is where Beachbody came to my rescue! Reading other peoples success stories not only motivated me, but also inspired me to believe and have hope again. I found the accountability I needed in my Coachs Challenge Group. Having Beachbody-On-Demand gave me access to the Beachbody trainers where I could choose a workout program that best suited my current fitness needs. Most of the workouts were around 30-minutes, so time was no longer an issue. Even with all of these tools, the consistency part was still up to my wife and me. But even that wasnt difficult since we used Shakeology as a delicious after-workout reward. I can honestly say, Beachbody has given me a new lease on life, and my family is eternally grateful.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I liked a lot of things about Tony Hortons P90 program. I immediately felt safe trusting him with my fitness evolution. He encouraged me to hang with the modifier and make use of the pause button. This actually helped me be more in control of my progress instead of feeling guilty or discouraged for not keeping up. Another thing I liked was the variety of the movements and the instruction on the proper form. I could easily commit to the exercises when I knew I was doing them correctly. I never got bored with the variety.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?The P90 program got me off my keg, kept me engaged, helped me lose nearly 40 pounds, and gave me the six-pack I only previously dreamed of. Im most proud of being able to wear size 32 jeans again (instead of my 36s). It had been about 30 years since Ive been able to wear 32s.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My confidence and stamina have greatly increased since completing my Beachbody program. I now have confidence that my health and fitness goals are both realistic and forthcoming. My hope is restored. My stamina is incredible now that Im not carrying around the equivalent weight of a 32-count flat of water (37 pounds). I have the energy I need to help my wife in the kitchen or make repairs on our home. My daughter has a daddy who can get down to her level and play. The only thing lacking is more hours in the day.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Our Challenge Group totally kept me inspired and motivated to stay the course. My Coach Tara kept things real and I fell in love with people on the team experiencing many of the same challenges I was facing. For now, we laugh together, cry together, and share our struggles to further motivate and inspire the team towards success. Were all human and sometimes need to be part of something bigger to stay encouraged. I dont think I could have completed the program without my coach and team.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Coach Tara gave me plenty of advice and ideas before and during my fitness program. Today, she listens and identifies with many of my challenges. I trust her integrity and feel comfortable asking her for help. When she doesnt have the answer, she investigates and finds them out on my behalf. If I could place her on a pedestal, she would go directly under my wife for inspiration and motivation. She definitely embodies the Beachbody image.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Shakeology was a reward for completing our daily workout and still is to this day. I cannot imagine starting my day without this delicious superfood shake, that my body craves. I believe its instrumental in controlling my sweet cravings and it keeps me regular. I can concentrate better and have a ton of energy. Still the greatest fitness benefit gained was Shakeology keeping me on track to never miss a workout. To me, consistency is everything!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?After completing P90, my lower back no longer hurts. I seem to walk taller and slouch less.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

If your home is pet friendly, encourage your friends to bring their dogs  dressed up in patriotic costumes!Clam BoilAll you need is a four-gallon pot with a fitted strainer (or 3 gallon without a strainer). Add a few pounds of clams, chicken sausage (minimally-processed, nitrite free), fresh corn, potatoes, onions, and Old Bay. Youll have steaming cup of tradition to pass around in 20 minutes. Throw veggies in the pot of 5 quarts of water and 3 cups of clam juice for ten minutes, then add clean clams, sausage and shrimp for another 8 minutes. Voila! A tradition of the North East birthplace of our constitutional rights is ready to be consumed.Recession Friendly Ring TossGot athletic friends? Gather 10 blow up rings and set up an old broomstick in the yard. Every time someone misses, they must perform five burpees, 10 push-ups, or 20 bicycles to get back in the game. Tossing the rings from small groups will give everyone a chance to cheer and sweat. Once a few winners have been chosen, they can go head-to-head.Note: This can also be done with official ring toss gear, Mr. Fancy Pants.Community Round RobinInvite your neighbors to join you in a little community scavenger hunt.

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/focus-t25-results-gary-lost-43-4-pounds-and-won-1000,"Gary Rhodes, age 31, lost 43.4 lbs in five months with FOCUS T25 and the Beachbody Performance supplements. He entered his results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I have had success with Beachbody in the past. I lost over 80 lbs with two rounds of INSANITY. I then took a maintenance approach and was able to keep the weight off. Then, last year, with the economic downturn, I began to stress a lot. As others lost their jobs, my workload increased, taking up more and more of my time. Even still, the fear of losing my job lingered over my head. With all of this stress weighing on me, I pushed my fitness to the back burner. I began to eat whatever was convenient, not caring about the quality or quantity. By the end of the year I had gained nearly all of the weight back. I started dieting, and lost some weight initially, but I soon hit a plateau. I knew I needed to do more.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?One day, when I was looking through some old photos, I stumbled upon my before and after photos from INSANITY. The before photo looked way too familiar. I went to the mirror and took a good look at myself. I looked at the before photo and back to the mirror. There was little to no difference. How could I have let myself go this far? I had never felt more ashamed. I decided to put my before and after photos as the background on my phone. I reminder of what I was. What I could be. What I would be. With even less time available with my current work schedule, I wasnt sure that I would be able to find enough time for a program like INSANITY. Then I saw the FOCUS T25 DVDs. Surely, I could find 25 minutes. And so, my rebirth beganWhat is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?I had gotten so ashamed of myself that I began avoiding my friends. These were good friends. We had relied on each other for motivation and accountability. Now, I would go out of my way to make sure they didnt see me. That they didnt see how far I had let myself go. Luckily Beachbody had thought of this. With the SuperGym and Challenge Groups on TeamBeachbody.com, I was able to find the motivation and accountability that I needed, all from home. Now, after regaining some confidence through my results with FOCUS T25, I have reconnected with some of my old friends. I now have the best of both worlds.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?Focus T25. 25 minutes per day. It takes away excuses. You can find/make 25 minutes in your day. The best part about it, though, is once you get started, its no longer a workout that you need to do. You start looking forward to it. It truly is one of the best parts of my day. I get up in the morning, push play, and Im ready for the day. It energizes me. Not only that, but when you push play first thing in the morning, you have already accomplished a major goal for the day. You get to start off by crossing off one of the biggest items on your checklist for the day! It doesnt get much better than that. Beachbody On Demand is great, as well. Being able to stream my workouts anywhere, helped me to stay on track and never miss a workout! Its simple and easy to use, which is great when you are pressed on time. I have now finished the Pure Gamma Calendar, and will be doing the Pure Strength Hybrid next! I cant wait to see what happens!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I have lost 43lbs and 10 in off my waist with Focus T25, but thats not what Im most proud of with this program. I have so much more energy, now, and my kids can see it. They are being inspired by my journey. They are even joining me for some workouts! They follow Tania with modified movements and take water breaks (I dont encourage them to follow Shaun Ts craziness, lol). Being able to inspire others is amazing. I couldnt be more proud of anything in my journey.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I stand taller, now. I smile more. I move more. I can play with my children without getting winded halfway through a game. Overall, I just feel so much better. Sure, losing the weight and inches is great, but being able to look in the mirror and smile instead of just looking away in shame is incredible. T25 gave me that. T25 gave me back the life I had before the stress of work took hold of me.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Accountability is sometimes the unsung hero of fitness. Many people have the perfect program, the perfect equipment, the perfect location, but they fail. Having someone to help you stay on track, can make that difference. The Challenge Group I joined solved this problem. When I have someone waiting for me to check in to let them know how my workout was that day, it gives me motivation. I wont just be letting myself down. Ill be letting them down. Seeing others check in helped to inspire me as well. If they can push play, so can I. Plus, its a lot more fun when you get to brag to others about killing a workout, that just telling yourself!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Daniel gives you as much attention as you need. If I ever had a question, he was quick to answer it. No matter the question. He didnt hover, though. He let me do my thing, but I always knew he was there if I needed him. If I decide to take the next step into coaching, I know that he will help me to succeed in that endeavor, as well.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort."

BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/bbq-chicken-flatbread-pizza,"Lets talk about pizza for a moment.Theres New York-style, where toppings are served up on a super thin crust that you can bend and eat as you people watch your way down the street. Theres Chicagos deep dish with slices so dense and rich that its hard to eat more than one (trust me I tried during my most recent trip there). And finally, theres SoCal pizza, made with a flatbread base and topped with all sorts of exotic toppingslike stinging nettles. And kale.And thats just scratching the surface  it would take a much longer article, nay, a tome  to categorize and classify all the different types of pizzas in this world. Unfortunately, most of them do not fall under the classification of healthy. This includes the best pizza Ive probably ever had: A basil, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese pizza I singlehandedly devoured in Naples with a knife and fork. And, now I want to go to there. It is, after all, the birthplace of pizza.But, like you, I am trying to eat healthy. Enter the BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza! First off, this flatbread pizza screams summer. Its loaded with barbecue sauce and chicken. Second, unless you tell someone, theres no way theyre going to know its healthy. Half of a good-sized BBQ chicken flatbread will set you back about 300 calories and will power you with 35 grams of protein so you can dominate your opponents in horseshoes. Or whatever the kids are playing these days.Because heres the thing. You could order a Dominos Memphis BBQ Chicken Pizza. And itll probably be tasty. But its 200 calories a slice. So, in theory, its lower in calories. But, if there is a whole pizza in front of me, there is no way Im eating just one slice.Which brings us back to the BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza. Its loaded with grilled chicken and onions and corn and other veggies that make summer awesome. What are you waiting for?Psstif youre gluten free  use this cauliflower crust!BBQ Chicken Flatbread PizzaTotal Time: 23 min.Prep Time: 15 min.Cooking Time: 8 min.Yield: 4 servings,  flatbread eachIngredients:2 whole wheat flatbreads (or 6-inch whole wheat pitas) cup barbecue sauce, reduced-sugar1 cups shredded cooked chicken breast cup canned black beans, drained, rinsed cup corn kernels medium red onion, chopped cup shredded cheddar cheese cup finely chopped fresh cilantro1 Tbsp. fresh lime juicePreparation1. Preheat oven to 350 F.2. Place flatbreads on a large baking sheet.3. Spread barbecue sauce evenly on flatbreads.4. Top flatbreads evenly with chicken, black beans, corn, onion, and cheese.5.

The 10 Most Contaminated Foods
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/the-10-most-contaminated-foods,"Youve listened to the hype about organic foods. But if youre like 45 percent of Americans polled in a recent Gallup survey, youre still unsure whether theyre worth the extra money or not. After all, your parents ate non-organic foods for most of their lives  probably still do  and they turned out all right. Plus, there are federal and state agencies whose primary purpose is to inspect food and determine if its safe for human consumption. So if they give it their stamp of approval, it must be safe, right? Perhaps. But heres the thing: While many government agencies and academic institutions have tested individual foods for safety, few have looked closely at the bigger picture, taking into account the cumulative and synergistic effects of all of the pesticides and other toxic chemicals we ingest each day.And thats what were really concerned about  daily exposure to complex mixtures of pesticides, says Sonya Lunder, M.P.H., a senior researcher at the non-profit Environmental Working Group who analyzes pesticides on foods. Some are linked to cancers and others are linked to birth defects in children.So whats a person to do? Start by reducing your consumption of the following 10 foods, which typically have higher concentrations of toxins than most other foods in the supermarket. Its almost impossible to eliminate all contaminants from your life, but if you reduce your consumptionofthe foods below  and heed our advice regarding what to eat insteadyoull reduce your exposure significantly.CONVENTIONAL HOT CHILI PEPPERSChili peppers are often laced with toxic pesticides that are banned on other foods, according to the Environmental Working Group. One such chemical, chlorpyrifos, can cause nausea, dizziness, and even death in high enough doses. The Environmental Protection Agency told us they are currently evaluating the science on whether to ban its use, and expect to make a decision by the end of 2016, but its still legal (and well worth avoiding) at the time of this writing.Your move: Buy organic whole peppers, especially if you plan on eating them raw. Some pesticides are broken down when heated, but you wont get rid of everything, says Lunder, who also advises eating organic hot sauces and salsas.TILEFISH, SWORDFISH, TUNA, AND SHARKThese five fish had the highest concentrations of mercury (a potent neurotoxin) out of all of the seafood studied in a recent report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Mercury is an airborne industrial pollutant that leaches into water, where it is absorbed by aquatic life. It also becomes concentrated as you move up the food chain. A large tuna will typically have a concentration of mercury approximately a million times greater than the waters it inhabits, says Paul Drevnick, Ph.D., a research scientist at the University of Michigan who studies mercury contamination.Your move: Limit canned white or albacore tuna to no more than three times a month. Canned skipjack tuna (which is used on most canned light tuna and typically has three times less mercury than albacore) can be eaten as frequently as once or more a week, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Your best canned fish option is wild-caught pink or sockeye salmon, which is typically low in contaminants and high in omega-3s (more on salmon in a bit). The EDF also advises that you eat tilefish and swordfish no more than once a month, and shark even less often (assuming youre not also eating any of the above fish too, since the effects add up). Smaller fish and shellfish all tend to be low in mercury because theyre lower down the food chain, and are safer to eat. That includes scallops, oysters, shrimp, clams, and tilapia, which contained the lowest levels of mercury, according to the FDA.FARM-RAISED SALMONAlthough FDA studies have found farm-raised salmon to be low in mercury, its high in another pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). A 2004 study in the journal Science found that the PCB levels in farm-raised salmon are as much as eight times higher than in wild-caught salmon. Thats a problem because PCBs can wreak havoc your immune and endocrine systems. They have also been linked to cancer and heart attacks, and have been banned in manufacturing since 1979. Theres still a fair amount of residual PCBs left over in the environment, however, and those compounds continue to absorb into the fatty tissue of fish like salmon. Indeed, the same delicious, fatty meat that makes salmon a potent source of omega-3s can also make them a potent source of PCBs.Your move: Physicians for Social Responsibility, a non-profit organization of medical professionals, recommends eating fresh or frozen wild Pacific salmon no more than twice a month, and farmed Atlantic salmon just once every two months. Canned salmon is considered safer: You can eat that twice a week. If youre worried about the impact of eating less seafood on your ability to get omega-3s, consider taking a fish oil supplement, which have consistently been shown to contain fewer PCBs than a serving of fish. Fish oil supplements are molecularly distilled to remove impurities, and theyre typically made from smaller fish like sardines and anchovies that dont have a lot of PCBs to begin with, says Tom Cooperman, M.D., president of ConsumerLabs.org, an organization that conducts regular tests of commercial fish oil products.CONVENTIONALLY GROWN SPINACH AND KALEThese leafy greens are nutritional powerhouses, but a report by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation  the biggest U.S. grower of both vegetables  found illegal pesticides on 10 percent of spinach and 4 percent of kale tested. But heres the scariest part: Only 104 of Californias 390 spinach and kale farms were included in the study. So while contaminated vegetables are destroyed or thoroughly cleaned when theyre found, there very well might me much more contaminated spinach and kale making their way to store shelves.Your move: Buying organic reduces the chances youll inadvertently be exposed to pesticides in your salad or green smoothie, but not entirely: Even a few organic brands tested positive for illegal pesticides, including Capay Organic and Del Monte. Its always smart to give your greens a thorough wash before eating them.CONVENTIONALLY GROWN STRAWBERRIES AND GRAPESFarmers douse conventional strawberries and grapes with a heavy cocktail of pesticides because their skins are so thin. Strawberries grow right on the ground and they have no protective outer layer, so theyre vulnerable to anything that lives down there, says Lunder. According to the USDA Pesticide Data Program, that potent mix includes 45 pesticides on strawberries (including a known carcinogen called captan found on 43 percent of samples), and 56 different pesticides on grapes.Your move: Buy organic strawberries and grapes, and dont forget about organic wines. Not only are they healthier (studies show that fungicides often end up in finished bottles), but theyre also a more socially responsible, as pesticides have recently been blamed for health problems in wine country workers in France.CONVENTIONALLY GROWN APPLESApples are popular year-round, but theyre primarily harvested between August and September. As a result, off-season apples likely spend a lot of time  possibly months  in cold storage before you see them in the produce aisle. Theyre treated chemically to prevent mold and fungus during the long time theyre in storage, says Lunder. And it should come as no surprise that many of those chemicals can have less than desirable effects on the human body.Your move: A study in the journal Food Chemistry found that rinsing conventionally grown apples reduced pesticide residue by 50 percent, and peeling them reduced it by a whopping 98 percent. Unfortunately, peeling also removes about half of the fiber content (from 5.4 g down to 2.8 g in a 3-inch apple), so your best bet is still (you guessed it) to buy organic. If that doesnt work with your grocery budget, rinse conventionally grown apples under cold water for at least 60 seconds while gently rubbing the skin with your fingertips, advises the National Pesticide Information Center. You wont get rid of all of the pesticides, but its better than giving them a quick polish on your shirt.RICEIt doesnt matter whether you eat organic or conventional rice  either way, theres a good chance it contains arsenic, a poisonous element that raises the risk of certain cancers, and can cause kidney and liver damage. In 2013, the FDA released a report revealing that you dont even need to eat straight rice to consume worrying levels of arsenic  a single serving of a product containing rice (e.g., beer or gluten-free brownie mix) can contain up to 7.2 micrograms of the stuff. To put that in perspective, safe drinking water can only have 1/16 that amount (about 10 parts per billion of arsenic). Why doesnt it matter if you buy organic (at least as far as arsenic is concerned)? Because rice absorbs it from groundwater, and hangs on to 10 times as much of it as other grains.Your move: Still buy organic. Youll skip the pesticides, and if you cook it in three times more water than the directions suggest  discarding the extra like you do with pasta once its fully cooked  youll reduce your arsenic exposure by as much as 60 percent, according to a recent FDA study.CONVENTIONALLY GROWN PEACHES AND NECTARINESThese stone fruits are nearly identical (a single gene determines the difference), so theyre both vulnerable to the same pests and diseases, and are grown with similar pesticide regimens. A peachs distinguishing fuzzy surface, however, means more pesticides cling to the skin before you bite down. Indeed, U.S. Department of Agriculture tests found that the fuzzy fruit contained as much as 62 different pesticides, while nectarines had 33. Even more alarming: A full 98 percent of conventionally grown peaches and 97 percent of nectarines had at least one pesticide on them, according to an analysis by the Environmental Working Group. By comparison, 88 percent of conventionally grown mangoes (another popular stone fruit) were found to be pesticide free by the time they hit store shelves.Your move: Buy mangos. You get extra points for buying organic, but given the low incidence of pesticides in conventional samples, and the fact that theyre generally eaten pealed, mangoes are one fruit thats relatively safe to eat regardless of how theyre grown.GROUND TURKEYNo less than 60 percent of samples in a 2013 study by Consumer Reports contained antibiotic-resistant strains of potentially harmful bacteria like E. coli in 60 percent of samples. And in a 2011 FDA report, a full 81 percent of ground turkey samples tested positive for Enterococci (a sign of fecal contamination). Since conventionally raised turkeys (along with chickens, pigs, and cows, for that matter) can be given antibiotics without a prescription, some of the gut bacteria in these animals develop drug resistance before theyre slaughtered. That resistance, if youre unlucky enough to catch a bug from tainted meat, can turn what would normally be an unpleasant but treatable bacterial infection into something potentially lethal. Researchers estimate that around 23,000 people die each year from antibiotic resistant infections, but its not clear how many of those bacteria originate in livestock.Your move: Any harmful bacteria will be killed if you cook the turkey to the recommended internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, but you might not be completely out of the woods. Antibiotic resistant genes may still be present, and potentially acquired by other bacteria, including those in our gut, says Monica Ponder, PhD, a professor of food science at Virginia Tech. Buying organic meat that was raised without antibiotics will cut down on drug-resistant bacteria, but some studies have found that you can still get them from vegetables fertilized with manure from animals that were treated with antibiotics. Ponder is currently researching better farming practices to prevent this from happening, but as of right now, buying organic is still your best option.MOST FOODS THAT COME IN A CANA few years ago, consumers started to worry about a compound called bisphenol-A (BPA), which is found in many plastic water bottles, food storage containers, and linings of steel and aluminum cans. The chemical seeps into food (particularly when the cans are heated during the sealing process), and once you consume it, BPA can mimic estrogen and mess with testosterone and other hormones. It was also linked to an increased risk of heart disease in a 2014 Korean study, which found that drinking two cans of BPA-tainted soy milk resulted in an acute increase in blood pressure.Your move: Many bottle manufacturers have stopped using plastics with BPA, but 90 percent of the canned food supply is still lined with BPA-based epoxies, says Lunder. Click here for a list of BPA-free brands, or check out the product lines at Whole Foods and Trader Joes, both of which have largely eliminated BPA packaging from their shelves."

Just Call Your Mom Already
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/just-call-your-mom-already,"For people lucky enough to have a mom to give a Mothers Day gift to, the honor of celebrating that mom can be daunting. What present can you give the woman who birthed or adopted you that appropriately repays her all that shes done for you? How do you say thanks to that? Annually?(For all of you not in the know, Mothers Day rolls around this year on May 8th. Thats this Sunday, so theres no time to waste.)In an unofficial, possibly fictional poll of moms nationwide, mothers overwhelmingly voted for a subscription to a monthly wine club.But forget all that. Seriously, your mom really just wants to know youre thinking of her. Every day. Fortunately, some of you are, at least according to the 2012 Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults by authors Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, Ph.D., and Joseph Schwab. The poll suggested that 55 percent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 29 stay in contact with their parents daily or nearly every day via text, email, phone, or in person. Another study from 2014 found that parents relationships with their children improved with the more means of communication they utilized, including instant messaging, video calls, social networking, and even parent-baffling applications like Snapchat.So maybe youve got that going for you heading into Mothers Day this year, which Im calling Mothers Day 2016: The Showdown. The Letdown. The Help-Me-Down-Im-Stuck-on-This-Ladder.The Showdown: Because this day has become an annual tournament between you and your siblings  and sometimes Dad  to out-gift everyone else.The Letdown: Because your sister inevitably wins said tournament  that overachieving brat.The Ladder: Because sometimes you get stuck up there. Sometimes your laptop has to be droned up to you so you can finish writing a thing due Monday. Just saying. (Send food.)What Should You Get Your Mom?Call her. Let me repeat that in case you missed it the first time. Call her. If you also want to send her a gift and a card, do so. (If you want to get her something last minute, might we recommend Beachbody On Demand where she can stream hundreds of workouts?) Shell appreciate those as well. But what she really wants is for you to let her know youre thinking of her and that you hope shes having a fantastic existence despite your ongoing shenanigans.Just be careful what you say. Because, you know, sometimes when your mouth opens, it says things that ought not to be said. Hold your tongue  literally if you have to.What Not to Say When You Call Your Mom Any variation on the send money theme, such as I wouldve sent a gift, but I cant even cover my rent or For Mothers Day, Id like to give you the opportunity to pay my phone bill or Im soooo hungry. Anything about your sex life  ever. TMI for the mom. She may say she wants to know, but unless shes Dr. Ruth Westheimer, shes lying  or shell use the information against you at a later date. Hows Dad? Not the time. As you try to sign off of the call, she may summon some feigned shock and ask, Dont you want to know how your father is? To which, you get to reply, I called for you, Mom  and watch those mom-points rack up. Dad wont care. He knows the score. If your parents are divorced, she may try the whole, Have you spoken to your father recently? Do not take the bait. Reply with a moratorium on talk of all things Dad: Lets not discuss him today  its your day. She cant argue with that. If she tries to force the issue, one stern Mom should end that portion of the conversation. Similarly, politics is also off-limits.If your Mothers Day call in any way becomes tense or heated, redirect to gossiping about your siblings or her siblings. Mom will eat up your empathy with a spoon and will be delighted you took the time to reach out.Just call your mom already. Wish her a happy Mothers Day. And mean it. You can thank us later."

Ultimate Reset Results: Lauren Lost 12 Pounds in 21 Days!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/ultimate-reset-results-lauren-lost-12-pounds-in-21-days,"SharesLauren McHugh, age 24, lost 12 lbs in 21 days with Ultimate Reset and Shakeology. She entered her results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,000!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Ive done so many Beachbody programs and I have had amazing experiences with them all. However, Ive always been lacking in one areanutrition. I can workout as hard as I want to, but if Im not fueling my body right, I am undoing all my hard work. Ive been a vegetarian for over a decade, but Ive basically just eaten carbs. Ive been at a plateau with my nutrition for basically ever, and I was at a point where enough is enough and I needed this reset to completely change my lifestyle.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?What inspired me to begin this specific transformation journey was that I have always struggled with my nutrition and binging, mostly on white carbs, cheese, and alcohol. I always overeat. Ive been watching so many nutrition documentaries the past few months, and Ive become 90% vegan. Ive been a vegan before but I was reluctant to try new foods. This was a huge wake-up call when I got this program in December and did not even start it until April. It was due to being at my wits end with my nutrition and not being able to look in the mirror because I was working so hard and not progressing. Ive never been where I want to be with my health, and this was my final test of willpower to really see if its possible.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The greatest challenge I faced was eating healthy consistently. I always workout but I always put my diet on the back burner. This is why I specifically chose this programyoure not really supposed to workout and the entire focus is on nutrition and getting healthy, making this a lifestyle change and completely redefining the way you think about foods and nutrition. The Ultimate Reset did this. Due to the strict meal plan, new foods and recipes, and my willpower throughout these three weeks, Ive come away with an entirely different mindset about nutrition and what I put in my body. It absolutely is a reset, and not just a quick fix. Ive done the 3-Day Refresh several times, but this was really the kick-start I needed to look at nutrition differently and fuel my body with the foods it actually cravedwhole organic foods full of the phytonutrients I need to stay healthy as a vegan, not sugary carbs! What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I liked that the entire programs focus was on nutrition, and that it came with ways to go the extra mile, which I definitely utilized. I like that there were Facebook groups available with the grocery lists, substitutions, water intake, tips, and advice along the way! I loved the way I felt every single day. I prepared for this challenge by taking dairy out of my diet so I think it was a bit easier for me, but I saw my relationships improve significantly, my energy increase, my productivity increase, I had more mental clarity, I felt super confident with my body for the first time, I was noticing a new take on my health and nutrition and it was rubbing off on those around me, and I had less stress! My lack of motivation, binge eating, stress-eating, cravings, drinking, my old habits, and my bad self-esteem basically disappeared!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I am so incredibly proud of my results. I lost 12 pounds from simple vegan nutrition alone! I did this entire cleanse as a vegan, and I also lost 12.7 inches!! This includes measuring the largest part of my stomach area. My skin is clearer, teeth whiter, my hair doesnt get as oily, Ive tried new vegetables, I feel lighter, and Im not bloated for once! For the first time in my life, I followed a program 100% perfectly. I never cheatednot even once. I never slipped up because I knew this was a life changer for me. Every time I stepped into Whole Foods, I was actually excited to try new produce, and to make this my consistent healthy lifestyle How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I look at everything differently! Right after I finished this program, it was my birthday. Instead of overeating and binging on tons of sugar, I stuck to my vegan lifestyle, ate in moderation, knew when I was full (for once), and educated my family about my new lifestyle. Ive always preached about being a vegetarian, but I definitely wasnt a healthy one! Now I feel like I can talk about a whole foods, organic vegan lifestyle with confidence, because Ive stuck with this, followed it perfectly, and made it a part of my day to day life. I will be using many of these recipes from the Ultimate Reset, will be juicing daily, and I cant wait to see how much more I can change solely due to the completion of this amazing program.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?I coached myself through the program. I did a lot of research prior to starting and found nothing on doing this as a vegan, nor any support. Therefore, I decided to take initiative and blog about my journey. I have 21 days of videos, all the recipes on my Pinterest, a daily blog evaluating every single day of the reset, so that anyone going through this journey does not have to go through it alone. I offer daily tips, advice, recipes, etc on my blog so other people can have the support I did not. Honestly I think it was a good thing for me because it was a very personal journey. I had to have the willpower alone, the dedication to get through it on my own, and in the end I think my tips and daily check ins will help a lot of people How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?I was so happy I could have my chocolate vegan Shakeology for a snack everyday! I looked forward to this daily because its my favorite, its delicious, it gave me a much needed energy boost, and Im used to drinking it daily! I was on the Ultimate Reset the whole time, so I already listed all the benefits. At first, I couldnt sleep and I had a hard time with that, but I could tell my digestion was getting back on track from eating so many veggies. My mood went up and down because this is a major cleanse, but my mental clarity was amazing! I also gained so much confidence throughout this journey, and became a much stronger individual overall.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?My digestive issues significantly improved. Ive been drinking Shakeology daily for over a year and Ive seen my health improve. Shakeology has saved my nutrition, and offered me a healthy alternative to quick unhealthy foods. I do not crave bad food nearly as much!You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Ive also included 5 tips on how to develop an approach that will stop you from engaging in that unhealthy cycle you know all too well and that will help you ultimately reach your goals.Pitfall #1: New beginningsHuman beings enjoy things that are new and exciting. It may sound strange, but sometimes its fun to start a new diet or exercise routine. You get to try new recipes and new workout routines and theres all these gadgets that track all your metrics. But, once the initial excitement wears off, we tend to get bored.Pitfall #2: Short and sweetWe also tend to have short attention spans and want immediate results that dont require a lot of suffering on our part. Suffering doesnt have to be physical painthough the soreness you might feel when starting a workout routine could count  it can also be the annoyance of not ordering your usual unhealthy coffee beverage or avoiding the fries or preparing healthy meals ahead of time instead of vegging out on the couch.Pitfall #3: Unrealistic expectationsIf it were possible to lose a huge amount of weight in a short amount of time and keep it off for the rest of our lives, none of us would be in this situation in the first place. Sustained, healthy weight loss and maintenance takes time, endurance, and patience.Here are 5 tips to avoid those pitfalls and set yourself up for success:1. Focus on the Big PictureAcknowledge the desire for novelty and meet these needs in other areas in your life before the newness of the diet and/or exercise routine wears off. For example, you could try a new sport or hobby. Also, look at the rest of your life and what realistic, sustainable changes or allowances you need to make to meet your goals. Include special occasions like birthdays, meals out, and vacations into your overall plan.2. Become a Mental Endurance AthleteThink of weight loss and maintenance as a marathon rather than a sprint. If you reflect on your struggle with weight, youll probably discover that it took you years to get to where you are today. Similarly, it may take years to find success in your weight loss journey and to stay there in the long run.3. Be Realistic About Human NatureAccept your weaknesses. For example, if you know that an upcoming family gathering will be stressful and it will be hard to stick to your food plan, work around it by planning ahead. Consider what you will eat ahead of time and figure out a way to de-stress afterwards that doesnt revolve around food.Remember that being healthy is hard work and doesnt come easily and you may not always enjoy the process. Expect tough times when you are bored of your meal plan and feel like rebelling or resent having to work out because you just dont feel like it that day.4. Celebrate Your SuccessesWe tend to flourish and succeed at goals when we are praised. Instead of giving yourself a label like failure, when you go off-plan, tell yourself its okay and accept that youre a work in progress. Stay away from extreme labels that make you feel hopeless (failure is one of them), or set unachievable standards (like looking like a supermodel).5. Develop a Strong Support SystemMany people find that they are more successful with long-term weight loss when they involve others in the process. Announce your commitment to get healthier and stronger to your friends, family, and coworkers. Start or join a Challenge Group, join a Facebook group, or recruit workout buddies and accountability partners to help you stay motivated when your resolve starts to slip or you feel tempted to make unhealthy choices.Also, consider investing in counseling. There is a tendency to slip back into old eating patterns after an initial weight loss due to how we deal (or dont deal) with our emotions. A therapist can help you pinpoint patterns when faced with upsetting emotions and help you address problems when they arise instead of stuffing them down with food."

Transformation Tuesday: Greg Lost 15 Pounds with The Master’s Hammer and Chisel!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-greg-lost-15-pounds-with-the-masters-hammer-and-chisel,"Greg was disappointed in himself for gaining back the weight he had previously lost. He wanted to become healthier, toned, and sculpted with the approach of his 53rd birthday. He decided to tryThe Masters Hammer and Chiseland got great results! He lost 15 pounds in 60 days and got absolutely shredded. Read his story in his own words below:One day, I caught myself. I was slumped half lying, half sitting on my couch and there it was  my very own round bulb of blubber. It was my stomach I was looking at. As the lump grew in my throat, I struggled up from the couch and went to look at myself in the bathroom mirror.It finally hit me  Ive got to change somehow.It had been just over a year since I had done any kind of weight training. I did PiYo in September 2015, and I had clearly gained quite a few pounds by taking a couple months off.To break addictions and bad habits, there must be a complete reset. I wanted to be happy with my body again.The greatest challenge Ifaced before beginning the program was believing that a home fitness program would actually work  let alone something that I found on an infomercial! Plus,30-minute workouts?Youve got to be kidding. However,I was looking forward to the combination of sculpting and toning in the program. I wassuper determined to work hard, and it paid off.My weight loss was not significant,but the fat-to-muscle conversion was dramatic.I can now comfortably perform pull-ups and chin-ups. I continued to increase my lifting weight over the course of the program too, but without bulking up. Not knowing what to expect before this program before I began, I was not disappointed.I have never been this sculpted from a program before.The dual workouts were so fun! I even laughed out loud a couple times.I also liked the alternating nature of the workouts, with both the Hammer and the Chisel.I get bored easily, so I can get into a funk without variety. I loved every second of this program.I have shown my transformation images to my challenge teammates, and the response from them has been overwhelming. Ive always been a pretty private person, but at my age and with these kinds of results  I really have nothing to hide, now!You can change your life, too.

Beachbody Results: John Lost 176 Pounds and Won $6,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-john-lost-100-pounds,"SharesJohn Mattes, age 40, lost 176 lbs. with a variety of Beachbody Fitness Programs, Shakeology, and the Beachbody Performance supplements. He entered his results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won $6,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?To be completely honest, my life was totally miserable. In an eight month time frame from November of 2014 to June of 2015, after my birthday, I almost died twice from complications from blood clots. The first time they literally said if I had come in five minutes later I would have been dead. The second time I was not presenting as strong symptoms but I felt off and went. It ended up being just as bad as the first time in November. I was sad,only going out of my house to do customer appointments. After appointments I would lay on my couch all day and eat roughly 10,000 to 12,000 calories a day of junk. I had no off switch and I was essentially killing myself. I really did not feel worthy of anyones love and was just going through the motions everyday with no plan and could not see a future. I was deathly afraid of taking pictures because I thought I looked disgusting.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I was, for the first time, really confronted with my mortality and how long my time on the earth would play out. The second time with blood clots was scarier because the symptoms were not as evident as the first time and I thought next time I am just going to fall over and die like my dad did when I was 17. My doctors were aggressively trying to get me to do gastric bypass. When I was on a cruise with my mom she was even saying I should do gastric bypass because I could not do it by myself. Even all my sisters piled on. At first, I was extremely sad and then there was something in me telling me to show them all. After my cruise I started drinking old bags of Shakeology I had laying around and just reducing calories to a somewhat normal level until I got clearance. Then I saw Casey Walkers Yahoo article and I reached out for help. He said he believed in me and the rest was history. Here it was, a complete stranger having faith in me when none of my doctors or family would.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My biggest challenge was I was newly released from workout restriction so I was constantly worried about how my leg would hold up because of the massive amount of weight I was carrying*. At my heaviest I was 410 pounds plus in June and on day officially starting workout plus eating on 8/3/15 I was 366 pounds. I actually started my first week of 21 Day Fix on a work trip in Las Vegas. It was living hell. Not only were there temptations at every corner, I was completely disgusted with how outof shape I was doing workouts. I was literally in tears every day for the first few weeks. The Challenge Group was run by my Coach Casey Walker, and Casey himself kept me on track. He told me just move, dont skip a workout, and take your Shakeology everyday. I would have quit if it wasnt for the group. When I finished my first 21 days and lost 21 pounds and 16 inches I was floored because I felt I was doing terrible. That moment just lit the fire and gave me confidence to keep going.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I chose 22 Minute Hard Corps because I was committed to several travel dates and I felt it would be hard to give the full attention and have access to weights to do Hammer and Chisel properly. I had already tried on demand on preview. I liked that the program was very challenging for the 22 minutes. I was able to modify difficulty and add tweaks to add in more complexity. So I would add more weight or I would do straight through with no breaks. The ab workouts, especially Spec Ops Core, is some of the hardest Beachbody has offered. It was a great follow on for the work I did with INSANITY MAX:30.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?So here are cumulative stats for my four programs (most recently INSANITY MAX:30) and my month of using Shakeology when I was on restriction. 410 pounds to 234 pounds, to total 176 pounds lost! 75+ inches! Bodyfat % from 51% to 19%! My A1C improved! Triglycerides improved! I was also excited to have my abs come in more, but the coolest thing to do was to tear myself out of my comfort zone and do a Tough Mudder on May 6th with a group of guys including my accountability partner Doug. I was able to do the whole 11+ mile course attacking it the whole time. I was even able to run down some youngsters. It was awesome to see how relevant the exercises I did in MAX:30 and 22 Minute Hard Corps translated to the course. My cardiovascular fitness is through the roof now.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I am a new person! My posture is different, my attitude is different, my relationships are stronger, and my earning potential at work as increased significantly. I have also been given a platform to help others which has been a true blessing. The last couple of weeks have been surreal as I have been doing a lot of partner events with peers and sales people I had not seen in over 10 months, at least 10 people came by and asked if John still worked at Gigamon and didnt even realize it was me. The others used words of profanity to describe their excitement. Most assumed I had done Gastric Bypass and when I told them diet and exercise they were stunned. Also during 22HC I got certified as an INSANITY instructor hoping to teach classes at local gyms. I am even scheduled for Country Heat certification at Summit which will be perfect as I complete Hammer and Chisel.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?The Challenge Group was huge! We were all strangers but the support and positivity bonded all of us very quickly. Any moment I had a minute of self doubt about being able to do the program or if I wanted to skip a workout, peoples posts about doing their workouts kept me in check. We shared all the time, and it made doing the program very enjoyable. The Challenge Group also broke me out of my lone wolf mentality and allowed me to open up, share, and rely on others for support. I have formed a very special bound with one of my Challenge Group members, Doug. He is now my success partner working with me on combined challenge groups with over 40 people in them! We talk with each other everyday and I know if I even think about straying he is a call away. I participate in our Challenge Groups we run like it is my first Challenge Group to keep me honest and to model the appropriate behaviors to people new to their own journeyHow did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?I think almost every other day I tell Casey Walker thank you for saving my life! That moment he said he believed in me changed me forever. He was always there for me and he was pushing me every day making sure I stay grounded in my journey. He even helped me regain my faith in God where I was recently baptized in January. I was even able to help him most recently when his Auto-Immune disease flared up again. I was there almost every day he was in hospital and it brought us even closer together. He thanks me, but I still tell him this is the least I can do; I was dead without him. He is just so genuine and so real, and he has a huge heart. I was also able to thank Casey and take him as my plus one to my Italy Top Sellers Club trip. It was awesome to let him do something he had never done before. We still talk or chat every day to push each other.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?As mentioned previously Shakeology was so huge in curbing sugar and coffee cravings. It is well worth its price! It was a lynchpin in my eating strategy I dont know what I would do without it. I have been using Beachbody Performance the whole time after 21 Day Fix, and I cannot say enough about the quality. All I can say is they flat out work, and I dont know how I would have been able to attack the programs with a consistent intensity without them. I had not been using Creatine but am now using it at the start of Hammer and Chisel as I am more focused on shaping my body now thatI am less then 20 pounds away from mygoal weight.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

In Memory: Steve Edwards
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/ask-the-expert-beachbody-programs/in-memory-steve-edwards,"Beachbody Vice President of Fitness and Nutrition Steve Edwards died the morning of February 25th after a long battle against an especially aggressive form of mantle cell lymphoma. He went after it with everything he had, fighting courageously to his final moments. I know this because I had the honor of being with him to the end. Steve may have been my boss for 13 years, but more importantly, he was one of my best friends.Beachbody President Jon Congdon (also Steves longtime friend) and CEO Carl Daikeler hired Steve in the early 2000s to help legitimize their budding fitness companyand legitimize it he did. Few people understand, live, breathe, and eat fitness the way Steve did. Whether he was writing the definitive rock climbing guide to Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, competing in a mountain bike race across the Himalayas, executing one of his awesomely impossible birthday challenges, or playing a pivotal role in the creation of P90X and countless other Beachbody programs, Steve was undeniably The Man when it came to fitness.I was the first member of Steves teama group that would eventually become the Beachbody Fitness and Nutrition Experts, or FNE. Were the ones who answer your fitness and nutrition questions, either on the message boards, on this blog, or over social media. (Always one for a good, longwinded answer, Steve struggled with Twitter. You cant solve peoples problems in 143 characters! hed protest.) Behind the scenes, its also our job to make sure the programs you buy actually work and the content you read is actually accurate.Much like the goofy old ensemble war movies he loved so much, Steve picked a pack of oddballsall with our own unique skillsand let us work the way we needed to work, as long as the job got done. We became the Kellys Heroes or Dirty Dozen of the company. I dont know if this was Steves orchestrated vision per se. As his right hand man, I would often discuss strategy with him, but hed usually give me just enough intel to keep me inspired and busy. Hed leave meand everyone elseout of the loop on key points on how he planned to deliver on the challenges our job presented. In retrospect, I think thats because he was Captain Kirk-ing his way through the situation, betting on knowledge and guts to bluff his way to success. Its not chess, Mister Spock, hed say in his best William Shatner impersonation when Id press him for strategy. Poker! Do you know the game?He would also remind FNE regularly to keep our egos in check and focus on the work. Theres well over a century worth of combined knowledge in the department and with that comes some fairly strong views. Thats just, like, your opinion, man, he would remind us, quoting one of his favorite movies, The Big Lebowski. And he was right. When we let go of our pride, embraced the fact that fitness and nutrition knowledge doesnt equate to marketing acumen, and played nicely with the other departments, good things always happened. Products were always better. As Steve would say, Were just here to help and thats it.In all the years we worked together, he only saw fit to chastise me once (although I deserved it many more times). One beautiful autumn morning a couple years ago, I played hooky to go kayaking in Redondo Beach, where a pod of blue whales was feeding. In so doing, I blew off an important meeting with several C-something-Os. When I got home, Steve called. So you missed that meeting and Im supposed to let you know thats not okay. What happened? When I told him about my aquatic adventure, he exploded. You kayaked with blue whales?!? Thats rad!!! Okay, look, dont worry about it, but, you know, dont do that again, okay?And I never did. Because thats how Steve worked. He inspired you to do better by your own rules. Hed just as soon help a 300-pound man walk around the block as he would coach a pro cyclist on how to crush his next race. He was the only person Ive ever known who approached everyone around him completely free of judgment. (Except every now and then, which was okay because there was nothing funnier than the rare, consternated Steve Edwards.)This Monday, Jon and Carl posthumously awarded Steve the Beachbody Founders Award. As they presented it, Carl told the story of an exchange he had with Steve a couple months ago. They were discussing Beachbody on Demand (BOD) and all the things they could do with it. Carl was considering the epic scope of the project and the role of FNE. As BOD grows, theres going to be more and more demand for expertise and advice. Because the more people engage in these programs, the more questions it raises. Carl pondered, how were they going to address that?There was a beat. Then Steve said in that laidback tone he maintained under even the worst conditions, This is what weve done since day one, man. We got this. No other company could do what were about to do. We got this.No one could ever fill the shoes of Steve Edwards. Theres a hole there now, but were going to do our best to continue with style. Rest easy, my friend. You fought the good fight and now its our turn. We got this, Steve. We got this."

What Happened When I Gave Up Sugar For Three Weeks (And How You Can Too)
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/sugar-detox,"For as long as I can remember, Ive been a sugar junkie. I probably got this trait from my dad, who can make half a pan of brownies disappear in a day. I can devour a pack of sour candies in 30 minutes flat, or pop 10 Hersheys Kisses into my mouth without batting an eye. I love healthy and nutritious foods and eat a salad almost every day for lunch, but my self-control is non-existent when it comes to baked goods, candy, and ice cream.Unfortunately, a tendency to over-indulge in sugar can lead to health issues, so at the beginning of the new year, I decided to really embrace a healthy lifestyle and ditch sugar for a week. Hey, anyone can go a week without sugar, right? But Beachbodys Senior Director of Nutrition Content, Denis Faye, immediately (and, I should point out, enthusiastically) increased my sugar timeout to three weeks. I regretted ever mentioning the idea. Regardless, I let him explain how to rid a life of the joys of sugar and I drafted a set of rules to follow over the course of those three weeks.Heres how I, a hopeless sugar addict, gave up added sugar  and how you can do it, too.The RulesNo added sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and no alcohol.First, I had to figure out what in my diet had to go. For three weeks I wouldnt add honey to my overnight oats, I would make my own salad dressing instead of buying it from the store, and I would drink plain black coffee for an afternoon pick-me-up instead of a handful of chocolate chips. I swapped out my vanilla almond milk for the unsweetened version, and I chose plain Greek yogurt instead of a flavored kind. My options to satisfy my sweet tooth began and ended with fruit. What joy, muttered my inner chocoholic.In addition to added sugar, artificial sweeteners also went on the no-eat list. You dont absorb artificial sweeteners the same as natural sugar, and they dont have any calories, but theyre weird chemicals and they put your palate off. explained Faye.Many experts dont count Stevia as an artificial sweetener given it comes from a natural source. Thats sound logic, Faye added, but if youre trying to reboot your taste buds, you might as well skip it too. I was interested to see if my sweet tooth would change by not eating added or artificial sugar, so I opted to remove all forms of sweetener for this experiment.And finally, alcohol. A moderate amount of red wine is permitted in The Sugar Detox plan, thanks to the fact it contains the antioxidant resveratrol. But it does contain a lot of sugar and it lowers your inhibitions, which meant it would make it that much harder for me to resist a sugary snack. It looked like Id have to find another way to consume my grapes.Of course, just because I was giving up added sugar for a few weeks didnt mean I had to walk away from it forever. Sugar can be useful at times, particularly if youre an endurance athlete trying to manage glycogen, Faye said. Also, it can be an ingredient in perfectly healthy recipes. The key is moderation. Since moderation is clearly what I lack when it comes to sugar, I decided it was best to start from zero  which is exactly what I set out to do.The ExperienceThe first week was incredible. The second week I wanted to quit. And, the third week I questioned everything about life.After reading The Sugar Detox and the 10-Day Detox Diet, I decided to go cold turkey starting January 1. Unfortunately, I just had baked 40 cupcakes for an eight-person New Years Eve party. So, on Day 1 of my three weeks without sugar, I was surrounded with about two dozen cupcakes. Not a great way to start. Since January 1 was a Friday, I adjusted my plan begin on Monday. Because all good diets start at the beginning of the week, right?Some people claim to gain a heap of energy when they wean themselves off sugar. I was not one of those people. I did experience a more even energy level, void of extreme highs and subsequent crashes, which is the normal rollercoaster I ride when I eat all the sugar I please. This made me feel great during the first week, but after the honeymoon phase, my cravings took over my brain. This was partially due to the fact that I was extremely tired, and it was difficult to fight off my desire for cookies and also the temptation to fall asleep at my desk. I had to make a conscious effort to choose plain black coffee instead of a pack of peach rings. It was harder to plan out all my meals, but I did it anyway. Otherwise, Id be scrambling to find something without a sugary sauce from the food trucks lurking outside.Despite my exhausted willpower, I survived the second week, and, surprisingly, entered the homestretch of this treacherous experiment with a new kind of motivation. I had yet to give up, and I had proven to myself that I could actually do this thing! Although my sweet tooth still wouldnt grant me a reprieve in the final week, I had tamed it. Overnight oats sweetened only by blueberries tasted like a treat. Water infused with watermelon sustained me through a rough afternoon. Was I really turning into one of those people who found fulfillment in eating natures candy? I felt good about eating clean food, I was happy with how my body looked, and I was thrilled that I wasnt experiencing post-candy crashes. Huh.The Physical ChangesSimply by removing sugar from my diet, I lost three pounds in three weeks. That might not sound remarkable, but my weight has been extremely consistent for the past five years, and I was astonished to see different numbers on the scale. I also had visible abs for three weeks. Three weeks without sugar meant three weeks of a flat, defined stomach. Dare I say I loved that more than a cookie?One physical effect I was anticipating was a change in my complexion. I had been warned that my face might break out when it was freed from the confines of sugar (the whole, it has to get worse before it gets better deal). Thankfully, that didnt happen. Instead, my skin actually got less oily.The AftermathThe first weekend after the sugar ban was lifted, I ate everything. Fries smothered in ketchup, greasy Chinese takeout, waffles, mimosas, and more. I loved ituntil I experienced a mountainous sugar crash and my face broke out. Within 36 hours of eating sugar again, my face had gone from clear and clean to oily, breakout central.As I was assessing my complexion, I had an epiphany. What if I could enjoy sweets in moderation? A novel idea, right? As much as I missed eating whatever I pleased, I hated the bloated, groggy feeling that came with over-indulging in sugary foods, not to mention the giant zit that decided to call my chin home. I also realized that I really didnt enjoy eating every kind of sweet. I didnt care for cheap chocolate or the processed store-bought cookies anymore. My taste buds really had become more discerning.After three weeks without sugar, I had lost weight, gained energy, and refined my palate. I also spent significantly less money on food and drinks. I guess thats what happens when you pass on wine and chocolate-covered candies. Am I going to continue on this sugar-free crusade? Absolutely not. But I am going to continue some of the habits I created. I like my homemade salad dressings, I now prefer a cup of black coffee in the afternoon to chocolate, and fruit for dessert doesnt sound as blasphemous as it once did. I dont think I could permanently say goodbye to my beloved chocolate cupcakes, but Ive gained a much better understanding of moderation and quality.Want to try to giving up sugar? Here are my tips, inspired by what I learned through the experience.Purge your kitchen, home, and workspace of sugar before you begin. I learned this the hard way with those cupcakes. But over that weekend, I got rid of anything that could (and would) tempt me during my three sugar-free weeks. This proved to be the most important act of defense. If it wasnt there, I wasnt going to eat it.Get a support system, and dont be afraid to ask for help. Its a lot harder to cheat on your diet when your friends throw you shade when you reach for something sweet. A good support system can strengthen your willpower when you feel it dwindling. Even if you think your friends wont take your commitment seriously, give them a chance before writing them off. By the end of my three weeks, my friends, family, and coworkers were genuinely interested in how I was doing with my no-sugar diet. (Yes, even my brownie-loving dad.) They wanted to know what foods I was and was not eating, and what physical and mental changes I was experiencing. It became an educational experience for everyone.Set a time frame. Knowing I only had to hold out on eating sugar for three weeks made the task attainable and gave me a definitive finish line.Learn what sugar is. This seems obvious, but sugar hides under a lot of names. My first trip to the grocery store was twice as long as usual because I looked at every single label, and looked up every single ingredient I didnt know. This thing called dextrose in my favorite hummus? Sugar. The rice thats used to make sushi? It has sugar in it. Knowing what to look for, and knowing what products tend to have sugar in them can save a lot of time and confusion.It was also challenging to eat out, since I couldnt look at an ingredient list for every menu item. Did the hamburger buns have sugar in them? Maybe. What exactly is in that special sauce? No idea. Instead of becoming a hermit for three weeks, I maintained a normal social schedule and challenged myself to find sugar-free items on the menu. My go-to option became a burger or chicken sandwich, minus the bun, and a salad. As for the dressing situation, I asked for balsamic vinaigrette on the side. Most balsamic vinaigrettes dont have sugar, but I used it sparingly to make the damage as minimal as possible in case it did.Prep yourself for success. Make sure you always have sugar-free foods on the ready. One weekend, my friends and I went skiing and they brought chips and Pop-Tarts for the trip. I was hungry and irritable for the whole drive because there wasnt anything I could eat. Had I brought my own snacks, it would have been a non-issue.Getting enough sleep is also really important. When my energy was drained, so was my willpower. It was exhausting to fight off my cravings when I was also fighting to stay awake. And thats when I needed toKnow how to cheat. If I were perfect, I would have gone three weeks without added sugar, artificial sweetener, or alcohol. Shockingly, I am not. I had a few bites of dark chocolate one night and a few glasses of wine another evening. I also indulged in Shakeology a few times, even though it does have some stevia in it. But I chose my cheats carefully. I ate dark chocolate because it was allowed in week three of The Sugar Detox, and studies have shown that dark chocolate can be good for your health. My chocolate craving was satisfied much faster than usual, so I really didnt eat that much of it. Shakeology tasted amazing, as per usual, but I noticed that it was pretty sweet compared to the other foods I was eating. As for the wine, I did feel quite giddy after just one glass. This indulgence didnt dramatically change the course of my no-sugar diet, but it definitely could have. No matter how much you drink, alcohol impairs your judgment. And when youre already craving that chocolate chip cookie, a glass wine might convince you that its okay to eat one. Or two. And a scoop of ice cream.Finally, fruit is your best friend. Really. As a devoted sugar consumer, I laughed when people told me that fruit was satisfying dessert. One year my family gave me a birthday cake with fruit and a cool whip topping instead of a heap of buttercream and I thought it was a joke. I was thankful for the effort and graciously enjoyed it, but I absolutely followed it up with a chocolate bar. So when I had to substitute my desserts for fruit, I thought it would be the end of mebut I was wrong. When fruit is the only sweet thing you eat, it tastes really sweet. I couldnt believe it. But watermelon and fresh berries became my candy during those three weeks, and I would gladly make them my after-dinner meal again."

Is It Really a Big Deal If We Don’t Know Where Our Meat Comes From?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-it-really-a-big-deal-if-we-dont-know-where-our-meat-comes-from,"By Laura TedescoFor weeks, the Internet has been abuzz over the removal of a food label that nobody  except maybe die-hard locavores  really cared about until it was gone: the little sticker that told you where the cow or pig thats now your dinner was born, raised, and slaughtered.Of course, if put on the spot, most of us will declare, perhaps in an act of misplaced patriotism, that we want  no, demand!  U.S.-certified meat. In a 2011 University of Kentucky study, for example, U.S. consumers rated domestic beef as the safest and beef of an unknown origin as the riskiest. Another oft-cited study, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, found that shoppers were willing to pay 38 percent more for U.S.-certified steak and 58 percent more for U.S.-certified burgers.But these studies represent only a theoretical shopping trip. How does country-of-origin labeling affect our thinking when were mulling over meat in the supermarketnot being interviewed by a white-coated scientist? Research reveals that, in reality, we may not give the Made in America stamp much thought.Heres proof: The same University of Kentucky study found that only about a third of U.S. consumers consider the origin of their beef a serious concern. And in a 2014 Texas Tech University study, just 1 percent of U.S. beef eaters said country-of-origin is a critical factor when choosing their steaks, rating the type of steak, the appearance of the meat, the price, and the grade of beef as more important than where it came from.Together, these findings suggest that, if asked, most of us will fight for the right to know where our meat was raised  but in truth, we probably didnt pay that much attention to the country-of-origin labels we now claim to so desperately miss.And as adamant as we may be that all things American are best, our tastebuds cant really distinguish between a steak from the States and one from the land of Justin Bieber: In the same Texas Tech study, beef eaters thought U.S. and Canadian steaks were equally palatable. That may be because the beef production system in Canada is strikingly similar to that of U.S. producers, despite the medias recent insistence that unlabeled, imported meat is something to be feared, says Kenneth Burdine, Ph.D., an assistant extension professor of livestock marketing at the University of Kentucky.Canada has a predominantly grain-based system, just like the U.S., leading to the well-marbled, tender beef most of us want, Burdine says. And if youre a fan of grass-fed meat, often touted for its higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, you may actually prefer imported meat, since countries like Australia and Uruguay often rely on grass more than grain, making their meat leaner.Still opposed to the idea of meat from abroad? Keep in mind that only eight to 20 percent of our meat is imported  and its not coming primarily from China. According to USDA data, in 2015, the bulk of imported beef and veal was purchased from Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand. Most of our imported pork came from Canada, and imported lamb from Australia.Much of the beef we import is relegated to ground beef, since the cattle raised in outside countries are often grass-fed, unlike the grain-fed  and fatter  cattle raised stateside. As a result, the ground beef you buy in the supermarket is probably a melting pot of meat: some of the fatty stuff from the States, combined with leaner beef from, say, Australia or New Zealand. Under the now-defunct country-of-origin labeling (COOL) regulations, all of the countries of origin had to be listed on the label  but with a notable loophole: If a processor stopped using ground meat from a particular country, it had 60 days to remove that country from the label, meaning the country-of-origin label may not have been entirely accurate for up to two months, according to University of Idaho experts. So much for total transparency.Another reason why COOL may not be all its cracked up to be: The law never applied to the most concerning meat products on store shelves  hot dogs, sausage, lunch meats, meatloaf, pre-cooked products, or products in which meat is one ingredient among many (e.g. spaghetti sauce, pizza). In other words, under COOL, the mystery meats of the supermarket were allowed to remain, well, a mystery.This doesnt discount the fact that country-of-origin labels can help inform the consumers who choose to use them  and that removing these labels means shoppers have access to one less piece of information about their meat. So, yes, from this perspective, the repeal of COOL is a step backward for consumers.But, the truth is, says Keith Belk, Ph.D., a professor of meat safety and quality at Colorado State University, COOL was never about the people buying meat  it was about the people selling it. At the time, the U.S. was importing lots of really lean cattle, because we didnt have enough cattle to make ground beef with, says Belk, who testified before Congress when COOL was originally proposed. So [cattle producers] would see all these cattle coming across the [U.S.-Canadian] border. They felt the government should do more to protect the prices of their products, instead of bringing product across the border from Canada. So initially, [country-of-origin labeling] was a protectionism effort.Senators from the border states where these cattlemen lived lobbied to add country-of-origin labeling requirements to the 2002 Farm Bill  and they succeeded, which meant that producers of whole muscle cuts and ground beef, chicken, goat, and pork, as well as various non-meat foods, including fresh produce, had to let consumers know where they came from. Congress delayed COOLs implementation twice, but in 2009, the law finally went into effect.In 2013, an additional layer was added: Instead of saying,Product of the U.S., for example, producers had to specify Born, Raised, and Slaughtered in the U.S. or Born in Canada, Raised and Slaughtered in the U.S. This change was an attempt to appease the World Trade Organization (WTO), which had already begun cracking down on country-of-origin labeling, since it was found to violate international trade agreements.If all of this sounds like a move toward greater transparency, think again: The producers that pushed for country-of-origin labeling opposed traceability  that is, the use of barcoded ear tags, retinal scanning, or DNA tracking to follow livestock from birth to slaughter, making it easy to prove whether or not the animal was truly of 100 percent U.S. origin. They didnt want to put themselves in the position of proving that their cattle came from where they said they came from, explains Belk. The result was an honor system of sorts: Under COOL legislation, producers legally only had to sign an affidavit promising their cattle were raised where they advertised. Not all producers are honestmost of them are, but there are some that arent, Belk says.When the U.S. appealed the WTO ruling, the organization stuck by its decision, permitting Mexico and Canadatwo of the countries most significantly affected by COOL  to instate retaliatory trade sanctions against the United States, totaling more than $1 billion. This is what ultimately prompted Congress to repeal the labeling law for beef and pork in December.But before you claim conspiracy the government wants to feed us filthy meat! consider this: The USDA has consistently explained that country-of-origin labeling is a marketing program, not a food-safety measure. It means almost nothing for food safety, contends Edward Mills, Ph.D., an associate professor of meat science at Penn State University. It just makes a difference on what labels are on the boxes and packages. Burdine echoes this sentiment: Country-of-origin does not impact the inspection or food safety standards at allwhether the label is there or not, the same food safety standards apply.Read: Regardless of where the meat is from  whether California or Australia or Uruguaythe product is held to the same rigorous rules, or what the USDA calls equivalency requirements.This means that processing facilities around the world must use the same, or equivalent, safety measures as those implemented in the U.S., says Belk, who has visited a number of plants around the worldand concluded that [imported meat] is at least as safe as the meat youd buy here.In fact, the concern over the origins of meat may simply be due to a lack of understanding of how our food inspection system works. In recent years, with the spate of cases of contaminated produce, theres understandable anxiety about imported fruits and vegetables. But produce is under the jurisdiction of the FDA, while meat is presided over by the USDA  a distinction that matters. The USDA has over 3,000 inspectors for under 3,000 plants, says Mills, whereas FDA has a few hundred inspectors for something like 5,000 plants. As Belk explains, USDA has inspectors in every plant that produces beef that is sold in the United States. FDA has only enough inspectors to look at processing operations once every three years.Bottom line: Country-of-origin labels provided a piece of information  and any information is valuable when it comes to the food we eat. But the labels are not the end-all-be-all for selecting safe, high-quality food. So what should you rely on instead?Look for the USDA stamp of approvalIt should be a given that your meat has been inspected by the USDA  but occasionally, a shipment slips through the cracks, as was recently the case with chicken and beef from a California producer, prompting a recall of the uninspected meat. So scan the package for a stamp that says the USDA inspected  and passed  the meat. The USDA inspection stamp on meat products is a really, really important indicator of safety, says Mills. That tells you that the animal was healthy at slaughter, that it was slaughtered and processed in a sanitary environment, that the appropriate temperatures have been maintained.Be aware that you may occasionally encounter chicken without a USDA stamp  and that doesnt mean it was unintentionally passed over. Small poultry producers are legally exempted from inspection, says Mills, so you wont see the USDA icon on their packaging. In these cases, consider asking the producer to show you third-party certificationfor example, from the Global Food Safety Initiativeso you know that certain safety standards are being upheld.Shop local  with cautionIf you want to know where your meat was slaughtered, you may be tempted to turn to farmers markets for your steaks. But look past the charming chalkboard signs, and you may make an unwelcome discovery. You can find locally raised beef being sold that came out of a Tyson box, says Belk. He suggests visiting the actual farm to make your purchase  that way, you can see exactly how the livestock are being raised, and increase your odds of getting exactly what you think youre buying. Even then, you should ask to see third-party verification and check for the USDA stamp of approval, advises Belk.Visually inspect your beefMills trains chefs to look for two basic signs of high-quality  and therefore, tasty  beef: marbling and minimal amounts of external fat. You want to see the flecks of fat on the inside of the muscle  the marbling part  because thats where the flavor and desirability comes from, he says. From a health perspective, that fat is a very small component of the total composition of the product. The appearance of your steak may also be a clue as to where it came from  if your meat has little to no marbling, it may be from outside our borders. When cattle are grass-fed, as is the case in many of the countries from which the U.S. imports beef, they tend to be leaner, therefore yielding less-marbled meat.Make sure marketing claims are legitIf a products package is littered with stickers  Natural! Free-range! Organic!  look for a second USDA sticker that says process verified or for a Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) stamp. If you see either one, then as a consumer, you would have very good confidence that the producer was doing what they said they were doing, says Belk. In other words, both stamps signal that the companys claims about how the meat was produced have been confirmed by a third party.Shop for USDA-certified meatCountry-of-origin labels arent the only USDA-approved form of marketing for meat. There are several USDA-certified marketing programs  such as the Nolan Ryans Tended Aged Beef Program and Certified Angus Beef  that ensure the meat sold under these names abides by a set of standards above and beyond the law. They have to pass inspection, they have to be safe  but they also have to meet a level of quality that is quite specific, says Mills. If you buy something with the Certified Angus Beef logo on it, you know they selected from the upper two-thirds of choice, that theyve selected cattle that do not have bromine genetics. Meat from bromine cattle tends to not be as tender. So those are excluded. For a complete list of certified programs for beef, veal, pork, and lamb, click here.Go organicAlthough organic wont tell you much about taste, says Mills, it will guarantee that synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, and genetic engineering havent been used during production of your meat; the animals were fed an organic diet; the livestock spent a significant amount of time grazing out on pasture; and the animals have access to the outdoors all year, according to USDA standards."

In 2015 Alysia Lost 65 Pounds, In 2016 She Won $1,500 in the Beachbody Challenge!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/in-2015-alysia-lost-65-pounds-in-2016-she-won-500-in-the-beachbody-challenge,"Alysia Love-Bartley lost 65 lbs. in 11 months with PiYo, CIZE, 21 Day Fix, and 21 Day Fix EXTREME. She entered her results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?In January 2015, I was depressed, discouraged, and had no hope whatsoever in losing all the weight that I had gained. While giving birth to my son in 2014, I broke my tailbone, an injury which kept me from working out and losing weight postpartum.o I slipped into depression, and ended up gaining weight on top of my pregnancy pounds. January 2015 is when I hit the scale at 225 pounds, and my doctor said I had to do something about it. I cringe every time I hear the word obese, and to be described as obese is such a painful thing. I could deny it, and blame it on my injury and pregnancy, but it didnt make it go away. What made it go away was working hard this year,and beingable to trust programs that worked for so many other people that they just had to work for me.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I couldnt look in the mirror and be happy. I wasnt comfortable in my own skin. How was I starting off my new role as a parent by being overweight and hating myself? I really did hate myself. I was broken inside and out, and looked like hell. Then I saw my husband using Body Beast and drinking Shakeology, and getting really awesome results pretty quickly. I decided that I wanted my own workout program, so I started with PiYo along with Shakeology. It didnt look intimidating, it looked relaxing wrong. It was sweat-tastic.But by the end, my body was flexible again, the muscles surrounding my tailbone were stronger and helping hold it in place better,and I was down 25pounds! From there, it was an easy choice to continue with Shakeology and try other Beachbody programs. I went on to lose a total of 65poundsthis year with PiYo, CIZE, 21DF, and 21DFX. My biggest drops in weight were not just in the beginning of my journey, like youd think. I ended up losing 9poundsin just three weeks in December!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The greatest challenge I faced before taking that first step was the price.Financially, I didnt think I could, but in the bigger picture, I couldnt afford not to.Thank god I listened to reasoning, or I wouldnt be where I am today. The emotional challenges I faced were countless, but looking back, they seem silly at times.It helps having the support, encouragement, and inspiration that comes with the program purchase. You dont just purchase a few DVDs of workouts, you get the Beachbody family with that. You have a team of Coaches and other members helping you along, pushing you when you need it the most, and listening when you just need an ear. You really make a whole new group of friends through fitness. There is nothing better than having friends that are interested in the same things, going through the same struggles, and friends that have been where you are and are the result of where you want to be. Nothing is more motivating than that!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?Each program I finished, I felt was my program, like it was made just for me! My favorite is 21DFX, because its only threeweeks, and who doesnt want to drop pant sizes in such a short period of time doing it the right way! I followed a meal plan of healthy foods and never went hungry. It was hard around the holidays being around such tempting foods.But Ill tell ya, after 21 days, you break habits and create new ones. Particularly during the three weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas when all of my non-fitness friends were gaining weight, I ended up dropping nine (very noticeable) pounds! Those sugary foods and drinks didnt taste the same! Too sugaryandtoo salty.There is absolutely nothing better than natural food to me now, which makes it even easier to continue to lose weight!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I went from 225poundsto 160pounds, and from size 16 to size 7/8 over 44 inches! Need I say more?! My results in 2015 achieved with Beachbody programs, Shakeology, and the support of my Beachbody family are huge! Im not obese. People dont recognize me now whoknew me then.People that I meet now dont believe that I was ever that big.Its crazy! Initially, I thought that if I ever could lose the weight, Id be left with sagging loose skin.But these programs tighten and tone you up as you lose the weight.So for me, that didnt happen!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?In January, having to say, I need to lose 70pounds, seemed unrealistic and unobtainable to the point that I didnt think it was possible. Ive lost so much weight, and gained so much determination and confidence. In January, I was unhappy with everything. I even hated my job. Now, here I am in December: I love my body, I love working out, my tailbone is completely stable because of the muscle Ive builto, and I even landed my dream job (and I start January 1st)! I have so many more friends, Im the mom I wanted to be, and Im the wife I should be. Going into 2016, I am the me Ive always wanted to be! My original 2015 goals werefar surpassed, and my new goals dont seem so impossible.In fact, comparatively, they are right within reach!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?I was very shy in Challenge Groups at first. I stood on the sidelines, so to speak, and watched what others posted, which was enough motivation at first. Eventually, actually participating in the Challenge Groups held me accountable. I had other people asking me questions, and people that had been inspiring me were now seeking my help! By December, I was showing over 52,000 people the before pictures I was so ashamed of even my husband seeing. Try that for accountability! This year, I made awesome fitness friends across the country through Beachbody Challenge Groups, who made me feel like I could do it, because theyve done it. I learned how and what to eat, that non-scale victories need to be celebrated, and that sometimes you just need to give the scale time to catch up.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Team Beachbody Coach is actually my best friend, and husband! He inspired me with his own transformation. I saw firsthand the effort and time he put into his diet and exercise. He inspires me daily, and now he says I keep him going! He has the confidence to share his story and help others. That makes me want to push harder, reach higher, go far, and hopefully become a Coach too! Through all of the obstacles and surprises on the scale (both good and bad), he keeps me focused and reminds me how far Ive come and that the possibilities are endless.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?The only way to lose weight that will stay off is to lose fat, gain muscle, and fuel your body with what it needs healthy, balanced nutrition and thats exactly what Shakeology has in it. I know that when I drink my drink, it has all the nutrients I need for the day.Im not depriving my bodyby just drinking some diet shake to replace a meal Im truly fueling my body!You can change your life, too.

9 Yoga Stretches to Help Relieve Hip and Lower Back Pain
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/9-yoga-stretches-to-help-relieve-hip-lower-back-pain,"Tight hips can be debilitating. When things arent working right down there, even sitting or walking can cause pain. Luckily, a little (proper) stretching can ward off this pain, increase the fluidity of mobility, and decrease chances of serious injury in the lower region of your body. It can also take pressure off the lower back, decreasing chances of pain in that area.These 8 simple poses can help both stretch and strengthen your hips, but keep in mind when moving through them to listen to that internal voice of your body that tells you if you are in pain or just feeling a stretch. A stretch may feel a little sore but inevitably it feels like a release of tension. When you feel sharp pain, back out of the pose and consider using a prop or moving on to another stretch.Lizard-Lower LungeApparently, lizards have loose hips and this hip openers moniker is testament to that. Step your left foot forward several feet in front of the right foot. Bend the left knee until it lines up perfectly with the ankle. Drop the right knee to the ground and keep the toes curled under on that foot to stretch the calf muscle. Walk the left foot out to the side and place both elbows on top of blocks on the inside edge of the left foot. Keep hips lined up parallel to each other. You are opening the right psoas muscle and the left inner thigh. To get deeper into the right psoas, lift the right knee into a high lunge.Bound Ankle PoseThis pose requires that you bind your anklesand by doing so youll unbind your hips. Bring the soles of your feet together, pulling the heels close to your groin, bending the knees, and butterfly flare the legs open. If you notice your knees are set too high to relax, simply place a blanket right under the sit bones to prop the hips up. You can also take the feet out further from the pelvic cavity to create a diamond shape with the legs. Keeping your spine straight, lead with the chest, pull your shoulders back, and fold toward your feet. This pose will open and relax the inner thighs and groin.Cow Face PoseBegin by threading the left leg under your right leg. Work toward stacking the knees, while keeping both sit bones on the ground. Tuck the toes in to protect the knees. Sit in the pose for several minutes. When the muscles start to loosen and you no longer feel a stretch, fold forward with a straight spine. If this stretch is too intense, you can situate both sit bones on a blanket and place a block or blanket between the knees.Pigeon PoseStarting in downward facing dog, lift the right leg and step it forward between the hands. Drop the left knee down and untuck the toes. Slide the right foot over toward your left pelvic bone placing the outside edge of the right leg on the floor. Tuck the right toes in (flexing the foot). Line up hips parallel to each other, continually pressing the left hip toward the floor. If this position is too difficult, place a blanket under your bottom. To intensify the stretch, move the right foot away from the left side of your body and drop to the elbows or chest. To make this pose less intense, move the right foot closer to your right leg and stay on the hands instead of folding. This is a profound stretch to the psoas, shin, glutes, and outer hips.Happy BabyIts not likely you will ever hear a baby complaining about hip pain. So, make like a baby and lie flat on your back, grab hold of both feet with each hand, bend the knees and pull them toward your armpits. Once in the proper position rock side to side, keeping your head on the floor. This will externally rotate and stretch the hips, loosen the inner groin muscles, and help realign the spine.Fire Log PoseThis pose should put the fire out in your hips. Sit on the floor with a straight spine, both sit bones pressing against the ground. Take the left leg out in front of you and bend it until it is in a straight line and parallel with your body, knee, and ankle. Stack the right leg on top of the left, lining up the right ankle to the left knee and the right knee to the left ankle. If you find the final position too difficult, you can use blocks as support to lighten the pose. This is a deep stretch to loosen the outer hips and glutes. It also stretches and strengthens the groin, calves, thighs, and abdominal muscles.Goddess PoseGentlemen, do not be deterred by the name of this pose. It will help you open your hips regardless of your gender. Step your feet out very wide, turn the toes outward, bend the knees so they line up with your ankles, and tuck your butt in to engage the core. The further the toes are pointed outward, the deeper the stretch. This will give your groin, inner thighs, and hips a deep stretch. Note: Avoid this pose if you have a knee or hip injury.Half Lord of The Fish PoseSitting on the floor, extend both legs out in front of you. Keep the left leg straight and bend and pull the right leg in. Line the right heel up approximately 2 inches away from the back of the right leg and 2 inches away from the left thigh. Sit up very tall, avoiding sinking in the lower back. Wrap the left arm around the right leg, creating a spinal twist. Move the left shoulder forward as you move the right shoulder back, attempting to line the shoulders up. Take your gaze over the right shoulder. This pose stretches out the hips, glutes, lower back, spine, chest, shoulders, and neck.Garland PoseThis pose is so effective for opening the hips that its the position most women use to give birth. Turn your heels so they line up with your hips, turn your toes outward. Bend the knees until you reach a squatted position. Place a blanket under the heels if they have to be lifted while squatting. You can also stack two blocks to sit on to work up to the full integrity of the pose. The Garland Pose increases fluidity in the hips, and stretches the ankles, knees, and lower back.

P90X3 Results: Military Vet Lost 45 Pounds with P90X3, Wins $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/military-vet-lost-45-pounds-with-p90x3-wins-500,"SharesKenny Baum, age 31, lost 45 lbs. in 180days with P90X3. He entered his results into the Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I have never been in amazing shape. My life revolved around fatty foods and sweets. When I was in the military, I was deployed to Iraq in 2008. During that year, I was at the gym a lot, and was in the best shape I thought I could be in. During my deployment, my wife gave birth to our first son. The day after he was born, we found out he had two severe congenital heart defects. Thankfully, the Lord gave us five months with him, but after five months and three open heart surgeries, our little boy went home to be with our Lord. Since then, we have had two healthy children. Life got busy, and my health was on the back burner. I gained a lot of weight, and was not happy about the way I looked. We were always telling ourselveswe were going to get in shape, but never did. Once we found out about P90X3, we were excited and on fire to get in shape. Now, I feel wonderful about how I look and feel. I no longer skip out on events because of my appearance. I enjoy my life now, and the transformation is not over!What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I am a very self-conscious person. When my clothes stopped fitting, I knew I needed to change something. After turning 30, I determined that I was going to be in the best shape of my life in my 30s and beyond. I was very unhealthy in my early 20s, so I had to make a change. Keeping up with my children after work was proving to be very difficult and exhausting. I wanted to be able to run and keep up with them, and not have to take a break! Two rounds of P90X3 and a healthy diet have gotten me to that goal. But the journey has just begun. I am determined to see an ab someday. I have always wanted to have a six-pack, but have never seen my elusive abs!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Time! Time was a challenge! After work, all I wanted to do was nothing. P90X3s 30-minute workouts helped me overcome the time issue. It was easy to fit it into my schedule. I will continue buying Beachbody programs, because they make sense of my busy schedule. No trips to the gym, no babysitters just plug it in and get your burn on! Thanks, Beachbody!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I loved how fast I could get my workout done and continue on with the rest of my day. Muscle confusion worked wonders! It helped keep my focus. There are so many workouts to do and so many different ways of targeting muscles. Each day, you were sore in a different area, but it was a good sore. It was akind of sore that made you know you targeted that muscle group and that you were gaining strength.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?At first, I was out of shape, had horrible back pain, got a poor nights sleep (including arms that fall asleep), and had bad heartburn. I hadshort-sleeve shirts that I could no longer wear, and was self-conscious around friends andfamily members. I hated the way I looked and the way I felt. But after P90X3, I took my life back into control and gained my health, confidence, and self-control. My wife was by my side the whole time, and we completed the program together with great results! We helped each other push through the tough times, and are now closer because of it!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I have more confidence in my everyday life! I feel great about how I look, and cant wait to complete another program!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach provided words of encouragement when times were tough, and inspiring posts and motivational phrases to keep me going!You can change your life, too.

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-dennise-lost-20-pounds-with-cize,"Dennise P. was feeling depressed and lackedenergyto play with her son. She had heard aboutCIZEfrom acolleague,but put off ordering it. Finally, her birthday rolled around, and she asked her husband for CIZE. He obliged, and she had great results! After doing CIZE for 6 weeks (adding in21 Day Fixfor the last two weeks), she lost 20 pounds! Check out her story in her own words right here:I was depressed, had no energy, and my 3-year-old was suffering because mommy was too tired to play. I was always grumpy with my husband andthings were just going downhillfor us.On the first day, I had a little frustration. It was difficult to keep up. I took more than 5 breaks on the first and second days. On my third and fourthdays, I was doing much better. Now I love it I always feel great, full of energy andif I ever feel down, I just dance my emotions away.Best cure ever!My favorite workout isFull Out! Thats a beast! I love Chandelier, but Im really slow at it, and hoping to get better soon!I like that I never get sore. I sweat like a pig, but I dont get sore and that is extremely important for me.I can do CIZEevery day of the week and still feel amazing.That is very good for me because Im a massage therapist and the main reason I never wanted to do exercise was because I was avoiding to get more sore or injure myself and not be able to work.My favorite thing about Shaun T is his voice talking to me. It is like he has all the patience in the world, and he is just waiting for me to get it. He sings his instructions and makes everything so smooth. Before starting CIZE, my dance skills were really bad!After completing CIZE, my dance skills are good!I used CIZE for the first 30days,and a hybrid of CIZE & 21 Day Fix for two more weeks.I lost 6 pounds in my first week, and my husband was so impressed with my results and my mood change that he ordered his own challenge pack. Now we are both coaches and on our way to being fit and healthy again.I have lost 20 pounds in less than 60 days, and I still have 50 more pounds to go!

Transformation Tuesday: Kim Lost 50.5 Pounds With FOCUS T25!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-kim-lost-50-5-pounds-with-focus-t25,"2Shares2Kim was extremely depressed and unhappy with her weight. She felt like no matter how hard she worked out at the gym, she couldnt lose the weight. She would cut her food intake drastically and avoided the mirror. After seeing a photo of herself in her bathing suit, she decided to take the leap with Beachbody. She lost 50.5 pounds and 31 inches in 22 weeks withFOCUS T25! Read her amazing story in her own words below:My favorite thing to do is to be on the water or by the pool, but I started hating it because I was so unhappy with my appearance. On my 31st birthday, my husband asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate. He knows how much I love going on the boat and spending time with him and my friends. However, I was hesitant, becauseall my friends are small, and I wasnt.My husband has always been my rock. He loves me no matter what, and told me I need to stop worrying and just enjoy life. So we decided to have all our friends join us on the river for a day of celebrating. The next day I looked at the pictures, and was disgusted by the girl who was staring back at me. Who was she? I mean she looked like me, but I could see the pain in her eyes.She wasnt the happy person I once knew.My biggest challenge was self-confidence! I let my weight control my life. I would avoid parties and get-togethers so that I didnt have to be seen. I felt like I didnt have time and nothing worked.FOCUS T25 eliminated that excuse because it was only 25 minutes a day, 5 days a week.I did one round of Alpha and Beta, two rounds of Gamma, another round of Beta, and a final round of Alpha. I loved Gamma and did 2 rounds because I was seeing such a change in my body. My orinigal goal was to lose 15-20 pounds. I achieved my goals and even surpassed them! I never thought I could get in this great ofshape, especially after 2 C-sections and being in my 30s.I lost more than 50 pounds, reduced my body fat, and have energy that never stops.I never thought I would say this, I am blown away by the results I got with FOCUS T25! I couldnt be happier or more proud of myself or my body.I worked hard for it, and I earned it!I literally melted! If someone told me that I could lose 50 pounds by working out 25 minutes a night, I would have never believed them. This program is for real. I still get excited when I talk about it! Its just such an amzing program.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

David’s New Year’s Resolution Paid Off — Literally
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/davids-new-years-resolution-paid-off-literally,"David C., age 45 from Springfield, MO, lost 42 lbs. with P90X3 and INSANITY. He entered his results into The Beachbody Challenge and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I felt like crap. Period. I was overweight, unhealthy, depressed, on daily medication, not sleeping well, and the list goes on. My jeans had gone from a loose 32-inch waistline to a tight 36 inches. I kept wearing looser and looser fitting clothing to hide my gut. I was embarrassed and ashamed of how far I had let myself go, and worse, how long I had been stuck there. I woke up almost every single day with a headache.I also had poor digestion, a horrible diet, and always got sick. I carried around tons of guilt for my weight,because ofhow it had affected my marriage (my wife Kelly always picked up my slack), for not being able to keep up with my kids, and for the bad example I was giving them.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?For a New Years resolution, I told my wife this would be the year I would finally get back in shape before our family summer vacation to the beach. By the third week in January, I had not done a thing to change and my wife showed me a picture of her friends husbands before and after pictures from his Challenge Group. The pictures were unbelievable but I knew this guy;he was my old friend, Chris Pinkston. I was envious, jealous, skeptical, and then also upset and ashamed, and my wife immediately apologized for showing me his success. Well, that was it for me. There I sat with my wife trying to convince me that I looked okay and I didnt need to do anything drastic. Nothing could have been further from the truth. I could see it in her eyes. I wanted to dig a hole and crawl into it. I texted my friend Chris that minute and told him that whatever he did, I wanted in, and no matter what happened or what excuse I made, tonot give up on me.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?Before Beachbody, I had given up. When I got married in 2000, I weighed 160 pounds. After 15 years of marriage, four kids, a business failure, and some difficult financial times, I found myself almost 50 pounds heavier, in terrible health, with no motivation, and depressed.Even my wife was beginning to lose faith in me ever doing anything more than just getting by. I had become accountable to no one. Beachbody saved my life. My Coach and good friend Chris Pinkston helped me turn it all around. Chris kept me accountable to myself and my goals. I put my P90X3 workout calendar on my wall and started making Xs for every workout. I printed out clean eating and Shakeology recipes from my Coach, and taped them up in my kitchen. I weighed in once a week, and for the first time in over 15 years, I finally saw the numbers on the scale going down.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I started with P90X3 and Tony Horton is the man. I love his wit and humor. I could not believe his age when he would be doing as many pull-ups as the younger guys, and then look at the camera and say, I believe I am 55 and they are 30.That always kept me going since I am 45 andbelieved lately that I was past my prime, never to get back in shape again. My second Challenge Group was INSANITY, with Shaun T he is an animal. I was always impressed that he would not just lead the workout, but do it all with us. I rarely kept up, but always enjoyed the challenge of trying to put as much energy into the workout as Shaun would.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?What do they say, a picture is worth a thousand words? Did you see the guy in the before photo? I have a lot more of them at the lake, the park, all with the same tired expression.I had sore knees, a weak back and core, headaches, and would catch every little bug the kids brought home. I was always trying to just survive the days activities rather than enjoy them. I am a whole new man now. A phoenix has risen from the ashes! I feel great, have more energy, am more confident, and happier. Complete strangers smile back at me rather than look away. I just enrolled for class this fall at MSU to finish my degree. On my 45th birthday in April, I ran 45 kilometers (about 28 miles) it took me almost 6 hours nonstop, but I finished just to prove to myself that I wasnt past my prime or giving up on life. All of this is great, but the single greatest achievement, the one that means most to me, the only one that matters, is how my wife, Kelly, looks at me. I know Ive made her proud.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My friends and family are all beside themselves. I cant go to work,church, or anywhere without seeing someone and getting the Holy cow! and Dude! and How did you do it? responses. I gotta say, it feels really good to hear and see everyones reactions. I am married with fourkids; the oldest, my son Mitchell, is 14 and has already outgrown me. He used to shoot hoops alone in the backyard while I laid on the couch. Now, he has a hard time keeping up with me as we go one-on-one. My wife and I take our four young kids on hikes rather than sit around the house watching TV or staring atour devices (iPhones). I feel like someone could take a snapshot of my life right now and create a Norman Rockwell painting.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?I love the Challenge Groups! I tried INSANITY without a Challenge Group a couple of years ago, and lasted two weeks before I told myself that it was too hard, I was past my prime, and that I could never be in the same shape as the people in the video. I immediately put back on the few pounds I had lost and more. I recently completed my second Challenge Group. My first was P90X3 for 90 days, and then I did the original INSANITY for the last 60 days. I loved checking in with everyone daily getting motivation and tips from my Coach, and being inspired to keep up with it as I saw everyone elses progress. I have made so many new friends in just the last few months from just these two Challenge Groups.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?It is not possible to over-praise my Coach, Chris. I have tried to work out, get in shape, and lose weight on my own for years, and I even tried a Beachbody program in the past on my own but with little to no success. The only reason I signed up for a Challenge Group with Beachbody wasbecause I saw an incredible before and after transformation on social media, and then I realized that the guy in the pictures was a friend of mine. I have always wondered if the photos you see online are legitimate transformations, but knowing that my friend had just completed it, I knew it was possible for me too. My Coach, Chris, was constantly there to help, answer questions, give support and guidance, pick me up after I fell off my clean eating wagon, and encourage and push me to be the absolute best that I can. I would not have lasted a week without him. I owe the 20or more years that Ive added to my life all to him.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?I am sure everyone says this, but Shakeology is the best. I have always used protein powder shakes and supplements, and I have shopped at places like GNC since high school, but nothing has given me the boost I got from Shakeology. My favorite thing now is just a simple chocolate Shakeology with ice, 1/4 cup oatmeal, half a banana, and a splash of skim milk.How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you have?Before starting Beachbody, I wason a prescription migraine medication, Sumatriptan 100 mg, for over 10 years. I used to take an as needed pill on almost a daily basis. The last appointment I had with my doctor was so that I could be switched to a daily prescription medication, because I was overusing the as needed one. I was constantly missing out on family activities and missing work, because my head was throbbing, I couldnt see straight, and Iwanted to puke. It was so badthatit even wore out my wife having to pick up my slack with our kids. Since starting the P90X3 program, I have gone from an almost daily pill the first month, to taking fivepills the second month, to only onein the third month, and during the last twomonths of INSANITY, I have not needed any. I am completely off a 10-year prescription for migraines, and I have never felt better in my life! My wife is beside herself and convinced that Ihave added 20 years to my life.Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (e.g. blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides, etc.)?When I started the first Challenge Group on Feb. 2, I was in the obese category on the BMI rating scale. I couldnt believe it when my body fat percentage came in at 29.5 percent. Two days ago, I tested it again and it is 17.9 percent! Sweet! Also, my blood pressure before was always in the 160 over 115 range. Yesterday, my blood pressure was 126 over 92. Booyah!You can change your life, too.

Fitspiration Friday: How I Got the Strength to Save Three People
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/fitspiration-friday-how-i-got-the-strength-to-save-three-people,"If youve tried a Beachbody program, youve probably had a goal in mind that you wanted to achieve. Maybe you wanted to lose weight. Maybe you wanted to get stronger. Maybe you wanted to improve your health. Maybe it was a mix of all three, or something else entirely. But, along the way, no matter what your goal, everyone needs a little inspiration. Every other Friday, the Beachbody Success Stories team will be sharing inspirational fitness stories from some of the folks who have done Beachbody programs. Maybe one will inspire you!Meet Dennis, a Florida man who not only got fit using T25 andP90X3,but who also used his newfound strength in an incredible way.I was driving to pick up my daughter from school when, suddenly, a car sped out in front of me. It jumped the curb and went down a hill into the lake. I immediately pulled my truck over, jumped out, and ran to the edge of the water. The car was already floating towards the center.I thought,Ive told my kids nevergo into a lake because of alligators. I dismissed the thought and ran into the lake. I swam to the car as it floated further in. Finally, I grabbed the door handle of the driver side. It was locked. I couldnt see in the car because only my head was sticking out of the water and the car was higher than I was. The windows were up. I banged on the window and yelled. There was no immediate answer.Then, I heard a man inside say, I cant. My heart dropped because I knew there was no way I would be able to get inside. It was terrifying knowing I couldbe watching someone die in front of me and was completely helpless. I yelled to him. You have to get out!Then the window went down. I boosted myself up on the windowsill. Inside was a man in his thirties. His kids were in the backseat. I asked if they could swim. He said that his seven-year-old daughter could, but his four-year-old son could not. I could feel panic start to come on, but I stayed focused. He put the back window down as far as it would go.I tried to pull the daughter out through the window, but she was stuck. She had grabbed her bookbag and it wouldnt fit through the window. The car had started to nosedive in the water. I had no leverage, because the front of the car was sinking and the back of the car was up in the air. I finally got her, her bookbag, and her brother out. The man climbed out and we started to swim to shore, which was about 25 yards away.The two kids were holding on my back and I had the girls bag on my arm. The man swam next to us. About 5-10 yards from the edge, I began to run out of energy and knew I was very close to complete exhaustion. I started to scream for help. I didnt realize that I was only feet from being able to touch the lake bottom until a man ran into the water and pulled me and the kids to the shallow edge. We had made it.Later on, I talked with my wife Cindy (who is also my coach) about the experience. If she hadnt talked me into changing my workout routine, I dont know if I could have saved those people. Since 1995, I had been just pumping iron. Cindy got me doingFOCUS T25, and I dropped 20-25 pounds which made me lighter in the water. Then I didP90X3, which had been making me stronger and helped me build full body strength and endurance. I know God works in mysterious ways, and I believe it was Gods intervention that made me change a 19-year habit of doing things my way. I always had the heart to do what I did that day, but I dont think I would have had the strength and endurance to do it. Since then, Ive completedBody Beast, as well.I was awarded a Certificate of Commendation from the local Fire Department. A year later I received a Good Samarian Award from the Sherriffs Office. I feel like my lifes purpose has been fulfilled. Three people are alive today. Oh, and one more note: The 4-year-old boy? He celebrated his 5thbirthday the next day."

The Ultimate Comeback Story: Sober, Strong, and Swaggerlicious!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/everything-is-better-everything,"Greg Cordosi, age 54, lost 53 lbs with Body Beast and P90X3. He entered his results into The Beachbody Challenge, and won $1,500!Greg is an Independent Beachbody Coach.Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?This is my second session with Beachbody. I did the Body Beast workout from February 2, 2015 until the middle of July (I was a daily Prize winner of $500!), then started the P90X3 program and became a Coach! I had almost the same experience all over again it was amazing. My body continues to change in ways I would never have thought possible. I wanted Tony Horton to tone me up and lean me out and thats exactly what he did. Im still shocked when I see myself in the mirror. Everywhere I go people comment on how amazing I look. I maxed out at 275 and now I weigh just 178, and I am hard! I know it sounds self aggrandizing but I have never met anyone who has done what I did. Honestly I cant think of anyone who even got close without some surgery or fad diet. I did it the right way with a nice healthy diet, Shakeology, protein powder, lean meats, fruits, and veggies. I took my time, never panicked, and let the workouts work their magic on me, and they did.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I was a savage alcoholic for a few years after losing everything in my life when the recession hit. I lost my business of 20 years, the building it was housed in, my home, my wife, almost three million dollars, and ultimately my sobriety. It nearly cost me my life. I finally was able to put that experience behind me last June by checking myself into rehab. I was a total physical mess. My BP when I checked in was 212/115. I was on the verge of death. I got sober in rehab and then continued that path when I got out. I got involved in AA, and actually started volunteering my time at the rehab I was a patient in as my sober journey continued. My sober b-day is the same as my belly button birthday May 31st. I turned 54 years old, and was one year sober on 5/31/15. Im about to graduate from college (12/15), the last thing I needed to change was my body and my confidence. Ive done that! I am Swaggerlicious!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My confidence level was at an all time low. I was a guy who grew up with mad swag and confidence, but I had lost so much so fast that it all went away. I felt like an absolute loser, and I let myself go because I simply didnt care. When I got sober (5/31/14), and my mind started to heal I knew I had to do something to really jump start my confidence again and honestly this was a total shot in the dark. I thought I was too old, too far gone, and could never stay interested long enough for it to work. I was wrong! The changes in my body, spurred my mind into a positive thought mode, and the craziest thing happened, my mind and my body just fed off one another. Suddenly my whole life had a momentum that it had never had before, and I rode it to where I am today. Beachbody is the single greatest thing to happen to my mind and body. I have a loyal FB following that love to see my progress and cheer me on. Its been so much fun. I love Tony, Sagi, and everything about Beachbody!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I liked the P90X3 even more than Body Beast. I thought Tony Horton was absolutely perfect for me. I loved the way he explained the workouts, what they did for the body, and the way he conducted the workouts themselves. I was never bored, and always engaged in the process. I looked forward to every single day, and found myself starting to panic as the 90 day mark was getting closer and closer. The best thing about the workouts themselves was they were just complicated enough to keep my mind busy on what my mind was doing allowing me to just work hard and not dread the exercise itself at all. The thirty minutes flew by!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I am most proud of the huge weight loss, and the effect it had on me mentally. I have lost almost 60 pounds in just eight total months between the two programs (Body Beast and P90X3), and I dont just walk the walk I strut it. Doing these programs allowed me to believe in myself again. When I bought the Body Beast DVDs I didnt really believe they would work, or that I had the discipline to do it the right way, but after that experience I knew the day I ordered the P90X3 DVDs that I was going to be done 90 days later and I was. Thats the difference in who I am today. I know its going to happen because I am totally in control of my mind and body!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?Everything is better, everything! I feel great, I look great, I get tons of compliments, and I can wear anything in my closet. My mental attitude is 100% positive. I am really as happy as I can be right now. I still have a lot of struggles ahead of me, but this program has given me the confidence that I can change anything in my life that I put my mind too. Just look at my before and after photos. What an amazing difference. The other major change is the respect I have earned from virtually everyone. Even my evil brother (lol), has had to begrudgingly give me my props for the changes I made. I have no doubt that after graduation in December of 2015 this program will play a huge role in the next job I land. If I can do this anyone can, and I believe it with all my heart!You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

What You May Not Know About Postpartum Depression
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/what-you-may-not-know-about-postpartum-depression,"Its not surprising that many new moms find themselves in a funk right after having a baby. Hormones are out of whack, sleep is a distant memory, and your entire life has been turned upside down by an adorable little squish, who is (no pressure!) totally dependent on you for everything.So, yeah, a mild case of the baby blues is both normal and understandable.But for many women, the funk doesnt go away after those first few weeks. According to the American Psychological Association, as many as 16 percent of women experience postpartum depression, a more prolonged and severe illness.Postpartum depression and the baby blues share many symptoms, including mood swings, crying jags, sadness, insomnia, and irritability, says Dr. Michelle Golland, a clinical psychologist in Hollywood, CA. But while the baby blues only last a few weeks, PPD symptoms stick around longer, andsymptoms can be more severe, including finding difficulty in caring for your newborn and suicidal thoughts.Many people think of postpartum depression as something that only strikes during the first few months of mommyhood. New moms are typically screened for postpartum depression after the birth and again at their post-baby checkup.But PPD can actually strike anytime within the first postpartum year. Researchers at Olmsted Medical Center recently discovered that when follow-up screenings were given at the six-month and one-year marks, there was a significant increase in the number of PPD cases. This may not be late-onset PPD. It may be the emergence of symptoms that have been lingering under the surface,  says Karen Kleiman, MSW, LCSW, founder of The Postpartum Stress Center and author ofTherapy and the Postpartum Woman.How can postpartum depression go unnoticed for so long?For starters, the symptoms of depression mirror the symptoms ofwellhaving a newborn in the house. Youre stressed, youre exhausted, you see your friends less, and you find yourself weeping at home makeover shows. (Erso Ive heard.)Kleiman says moms, may confuse their symptoms for normal postpartum experiences and not be able to tell the difference between being tired and being unable to function well.At that first post-baby checkup, none of those things might seem worth mentioning. But screen again at six months, and a woman may think: Hey, this has been going on for a while now, and it doesnt feel normal.Even if a new mom does suspect somethings wrong, she may put off reporting her symptoms due to the stigma surrounding mental illnessespecially since societal expectations tell her shes expected to be bursting with baby bliss. They may be getting messages from their support network to be strong or power through, Kleiman says. They may feel if they tell anyone what they are really thinking, someone will think they are crazyor worse, take their baby away from them.The recent research indicates that additional screenings could play a key role in helping to identify more women who may be at risk, so theyre able to get the treatment they need. Postpartum women should be screened repeatedly, Kleiman says. A low screen score does not necessarily mean she is out of the woods. A woman is most at risk for emotional illness during and after pregnancy than at any other time in her life. She should be monitored closely during these times.Until these additional screenings become the norm, its important to tune in to your own emotionsand listen to concerned friends who may be able to recognize your symptoms before you can. There is no shame in seeking help.Please remember that self-care is not selfish and that your baby needs you to be emotionally well, says Dr. Golland, who struggled with PPD herself as a new mom. Give yourself breaks when needed: baths, time with friends, and whatever else your brain and body need to feel solid and grounded. Its also critical that you get enough sleep; being sleep-deprived can have a snowball effect for new moms leading to PPD. Talk about how youre feeling and the symptoms youre struggling to manage. I would also encourage fathers and other family members to know the warning signs of PPD and to intervene when needed."

“I Lost Weight and Kept it Off!”
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/i-lost-weight-and-kept-it-off,"Meet Pam L., age 61 from Flowery Branch, GA.She has been workinghard to avoid type II diabetes and the heart diseases that run in her family,and she won $1,500 in theBeachbody Challenge!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?For years I exercised 3-4 times a week, yet continued to gain weight. Id fluctuate by 10 pounds, but nothing more. In the summer of 2013, I suffered a knee injury that a few months later required surgery. At that time I weighed 235 pounds. I was frustrated and depressed by my inability to change my situation. I was truly terrified that I wouldnt be able to avoid the diabetes, asthma and COPD issues that seemed to plague my family.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I had been fighting the battle of the bulge since my 40th birthday, but I was losing. I was well on my way to contracting the family tendency toward type II diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure, etc. I was looking for a solution that would work for me in town and while traveling. In January 2014. I started drinking Shakeology and moving towards healthier eating. I lost weight and kept it off ! It was so inspiring that I decided to take it to the next level and incorporate home workouts that I could do at home and when traveling.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?The biggest challenge remaining was how to eat healthy when out of town and eating out. Im not always in charge of the food selections and counting calories was difficult because I wouldnt know how the food was prepared. with the containers, Ive been able to visualize the portion size and cut down on overeating when in these eating out circumstances. Now, I can eat just what would have fit into a container and select dishes more compatible with my bodys needs.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I liked the portion control and the use of weights and resistance band to increase my strength in my arms and legs.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?Even though I still have a way to go to reach my personal weight and fitness goals, I remain determined. Im currently proud of the fact that I dont look like Im 61. It feels good when people notice the changes Ive been able to accomplish.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I tell anyone who will listen how I changed my life and saved myself from the illness path common to my family. Im also proud of the fact that several family members have begun their own fitness journeys after seeing what Ive been able to accomplish. It doesnt hurt that Ive had to go to a smaller size clothing either.How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Doing the work was necessary to gain the strength and sculpting that occurred. The challenge group was very supportive, especially when I went on business trips. I continued to work out every day and the group acknowledged and supported my efforts. It kept me going!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach supported me through her posts and participation in the Challenge Group herself.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?I drink Shakeology every day, usually for breakfast. It gives me the energy to do the things that I want to do, including my workouts. I know that I can count on being alert and energetic.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?Im not scheduled for a physical until May, but I havent been sick since I started drinking Shakeology. However, Im expecting to see that Ive moved away from the pre-diabetic level when it rolls around again. At my last physical, my triglycerides were phenomenal; cholesterol was lower and my HemoA1c number was holding steady. This was an important number for me as it meant I might be winning against my familys tendency to develop Type II diabetes. In fact, at my last physical, the nurse wanted to know how I mange such a great triglycerides number!Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)The workout programs that Ive participated in have allowed me to strengthen my weak knee and reduce the pain I had previously experienced. Without these programs, including 21 Day Fix EXTREME, and Shakeology, I would not have been able to reduce my BMI to a healthier level. I continue to work out daily and am confident that Ill reach my fitness goal soon.You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Transformation Tuesday: Chanelle Lost 18.6 Pounds with FOCUS T25!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-chanelle-lost-18-6-pounds-with-focus-t25,"Chanelle M. was tired, unhealthy, and she wanted to make a change. She couldnt afford the time or money it took to join a gym, so she boughtFOCUS T25and got to work. In two rounds, she lost 18.6 lbs and 22.5 inches! Read her story in her own words right here:In January of 2014, as my birthday approached, I started to reflect on the past year and the year ahead. I purposely didnt make a New Years Resolution that year because it was always the same thing and I rarely reached it- to get myself back into shape. My neighbor had mentioned FOCUS T25 to me a couple of times, but I knew myself and workout DVDs: I would start them and never keep up with them. As I was driving home from work one day in tears because I was so frustrated thatI was tired and exhausted all of them time and I just wasnt happy with myself, I knew I had to change something and that I was the only person that could make that change.I wanted to be a happy mom and one that had energy for my boys. I was so self-conscious that I was still hanging onto pre-pregnancy weight and my youngest son was almost 16 months old. I would go to get ready for work, a date with my husband or a girls night and end up crying in the closet because my clothes wouldnt fit right, and it made me not want to go anywhere. No matter how hard I worked with making healthier choices,the weight just wouldnt leave. I decided I had enough.I told my husband the week of my birthday that I was going to order FOCUS T25 and I didnt care if it had to be a birthday present.Our ten year anniversary was in August andI really wanted to fit back into the dress I wore for our rehearsal dinnerand we were also going to the beach with my family in June, so I had two things to set in front of me as goals. Honestly though, I just wanted my body back and to feel better about who I was.I wanted to show my boys how to live a healthy life, butI didnt have the money for a gym membershipand I knew I didnt have the time to leave my family and go to the gym to workout.With two little ones, both my husband and I working, time was a big excuse for me.FOCUS T25 eliminated those excuses!I could always make time for 25 minutes. We didnt just have the extra money laying around to buy FOCUS T25 so I actually purchased it on our credit card. I hadnt ever stuck with a DVD workout and spending that money I think pushed me to really dedicate myself because I knew my husband thought it was just one more thing I was trying and I wanted to prove that the money I spent was worth it!About a week after I purchased the program my friend posted on Facebook that she was going to be leading a FOCUS T25 accountability group. She had just finished month 1 of the program and shared her results and I was inspired! Her before and after pictures looked amazing and she was my friend, I knew her! So having that personal connection to her made me really want to stick with FOCUS T25. I asked to join her group and worked out with other moms all over to keep me motivated through the private Facebook group that she set up.That challenge group was exactly what I needed!My friend, now coach, was motivating and encouraging throughout the entire challenge and I felt like I connected with the other women in the group, as well. It was nice to be able to workout at home but still have a connection with other women. I also realizedaccountability with my nutrition and my workouts was the missing piece in my life.When it was time for me to do my weigh in the first week, I was shocked! I not only had lost 2 pounds, but I had lost 2 inches off of my waist. I was sore and I was frustrated because the workout was harder for me, butseeing results within the first week was so encouraging!I was working on eating clean as well, and it was easier to do with that accountability. Throughout my first month I started to also notice that I was getting stronger, I was able to do more moves and I had more energy to play with my boys. I noticed it was easier to get the large double stroller in and out of the back of my trunk of the car, these little things all started to show me that FOCUS T25 was doing so much for me.Throughout the weeks, I started to notice my moods were better, I had more energy and didnt just want to come home and sit on the couch; I wanted to be up and active with my boys. By the end of the program, I was amazed because I had never had completed anything like FOCUS T25 or had results like what I was experiencing. I had gone to gyms before and taken exercise classes, butI had never had results like I was having.To see the numbers on the scale continue to drop and my clothes getting too big felt amazing!One of the greatest results from FOCUS T25, though, was thatI gained my confidence back.That right there is what I want for my kids. I want to be a confident mom, and I am now! My boys are 4  and 2  and now they enjoy working out with me when they can, and talk about healthier food choices on their own. I want to be an example for them now so that as they grow up they know how to take care of their bodies. I didnt grow up eating clean foods and that is something that FOCUS T25 helped me with as well. Our family eats clean now, we follow the 80/20 rule as much as we can. TodayI am smiling more, I am a better momand I enjoy shopping and going out with friends and family again.After having such amazing results, I decided to sign up to be a coach. I wanted the ongoing accountability with my health and fitness but I also really wanted to pay it forward and help other women just like me that were moms who believed their bodies were just going to look a certain way after having kids. To this day I know I will never go back to where I was.I feel absolutely amazing, I am in the best shape of my life after having kidsand I want others to have the same results! FOCUS T25 really taught me that we are made to thrive and not just survive. When you take ownership for where you are, have accountability and are responsible for doing your part and are consistent, you can achieve anything and will have great results!I tried on that dress I wanted to wear to celebrate our 10thwedding anniversary and it was way too big! I not only reached my goals with FOCUS T25, I exceeded them, which shows me I really am in the best shape of my life!I am holding onto that dress as a reminder of how far I have come.You can change your life, too.

Beachbody Results: Stephanie Lost 169 Pounds
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/that-warrior-spirit-is-awake-in-me,"Meet independent Beachbody Coach Stephanie T., age 42 from Tallahassee, FL.She enteredThe Beachbody Challengein May 2015 and won $1,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I have always had a struggle with my weight. In school, I can remember kids making up a song about me, and they would sing it every time I would walk by  BBTbye bye tree. It was their way of calling me big butt. From the time I was young, I had people continuously tell me that I wasnt good enough. And I believed them. I let those voices define my life, so I buried myself under baggy clothes and continued to gain weight into my adult life. My life was on cruise control, but no one was behind the wheel. I was tired and sluggish all the time. After a meal, I would often have to go lay down for awhile. Going back to graduate school in my late 30s just added to the mix of stress and life issues. Sleep was a luxury. Sometimes I would forget to eat, and then when I did eat, it was just whatever I could find to stuff in my face at the time. My hair was starting to fall out in clumps from stress and poor nutrition  at age 39, I was going bald, and I was miserable.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?I was tired of always being the fat friend. I was tired of feeling like all eyes were on me when I ate. I was tired of never having any energy to do things. I had a friend ask me to go kayaking with her, which is something that I have always wanted to do, but I knew that I couldnt go because the kayaks wouldnt hold my weight. I felt like I died a little inside that day. I realized that I was letting my weight control me, the stress take over. My 40th birthday was approaching, and I knew it was time to take control of my body. I wanted to prove all the voices wrong  all those who told me throughout my life that I wasnt good enough or that I wouldnt amount to anything. It was time to reclaim and re-energize my life. This was my time to stop burying my true self beneath all this weight and let my light shine. I was ready to make a change and was willing to step up to do whatever I needed to do to make it happen.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My greatest challenge was my self-esteem and energy to exercise. I had convinced myself over a long period of time that I was never going to be active again, and so when I did exercise, I gave up really quickly. My self-esteem was so low, that I hated having photos taken. I couldnt stand to look at myself. Finding Beachbodychanged that.Beachbody programsbrought me mentally/spiritually/physically to an entirely different level  one that is much more centered and confident. The energy of the music and the spirit of the trainers made me want to push play every dayregardless of what was going on outside my time (my workout time). Going through dissolving a marriage, finishing graduate school, and piecing life back togetherBeachbody hasgiven me the strength to move forward and reach for the possibilities held in tomorrows sunrise.What in particular did you like about the program you chose?Beachbody programschallengedme in all ways  physically, spiritually, and mentally. The music used in the program is fantastic and keeps me going, and I simply just love the energy of the team of trainers. I love the strength and endurance I get from this workout program, not to mention that I feel so athletic doing it. Ive always wanted to feel and look like an athlete.Beachbodyis making that a reality for me. It was so cool to put on a tank top the other day and watch as my friends jaw hit the floor and hear her say Wow! You look so athletic!Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I love feeling and looking like an athlete. I feel stronger, inside and out. And I am so proud of the fact that I can now look at myself in the mirror and smile. I see those little bones right below my neck. I see curves in my shoulders and all my muscles taking shape. I love the compliments that I receive. Someone said you look like an entirely different person! The thing is, I feel like an entirely different person! I am not the same person who started this program back in December 2012. I have muscles. I have definition. I have confidence. I am more aware of how my body operates and what it takes to make it change for the better. And defeating those burpees  that in and of itself is a milestone of an accomplishment! The first time I completed every burpee in a workout, I cant tell you how happy that made me! At 42 yrs of age, I feel better now than I have ever felt in my life.How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?I have become addicted to fitness. I cant wait to push play. I believewhen they sayif you think youre tough, you probably will be tough. I feel tougher. I am thankful every single day that I get to keep changing my body and my spirit. Ive come a long way, but every day, every round, I challenge myself to master something new. I feel like I can take on any and all obstacles that stand in my path because I now have the confidence to make change happen. Working withBeachbodyopened the door to becoming a Coach. I love being able to give to others what this journey of fitness has given to me. I just started Round 14!Beachbody programs aremy energy, heart, and soul therapy! That warrior-spirit is awake in me, and I feel alive again!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?The Challenge Group keeps me focused. The group members have been my rock and my family. When I feel like the world is crushing down around me, my group lifts me up and keeps me going. And when they have bad days, I am able to give back to them what they have given to me. We give each other hope. Having a Challenge Group has kept me motivated. I know that I am responsible to check in with them every day. So good days or bad days, I know that I cannot let my team down  I must push play and keep moving forward.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?Christina is an amazing woman and Coach. Shes very encouraging and incredibly genuine in her desire to see each member of her team succeed with their programs. She always leaves small notes of encouragement in my inbox on Facebook or on our team pages. Each day, she keeps encouraging us to reach our goals. I am grateful for having met Christina and becoming a part of her Beachbody team. She has become my good friend, my hero, and mentor. She has seen the potential in me, even when I havent been able to see it. I cannot thank her enough for believing in me. In the times when I didnt or couldnt believe in myself, Christina believed for me. She reached out to me in a time of need and lifted me up.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Shakeology has become a part of my life  daily. I crave my daily dose of nutrition every morning. It makes me feel like Im doing something great for my body, for my health. It has helped reduce my junk food cravings, and it has helped me change the way I eat because my body wants healthy foods now. I also use Energy and Endurance and Results and Recovery for my workouts, and I can say that both of these products have helped me dig deeper and push through the longer workouts when my body normally would say no more. I love that these all of these products are natural because I know Im doing something good for myself every time I use them. My body thanks me, too. Then came this 3-Day Refresh program holy canolis, batman! What an amazing program! The first day was grueling, but as time passed, I felt healthier and lighter. It made me feel like my body was working to full capacity again. I will definitely be revisiting 3DR in the future.Results vary based on starting point and effort.You can change your life, too.

Beachbody Results: Justin Lost 164 lbs. and Won $106,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/i-began-to-feel-unstoppable,"Meet Justin Wells, age 35 from Frenchburg, Kentucky. He lost 164lbs with Beachbodys system of fitness, nutrition, and support, andyour votes helped him win a total of $106,500 in theBeachbody Challenge!Results achieved with 21 Day Fix, 21 Day Fix Extreme,INSANITY MAX:30,P90X3, and Shakeology. See his storyTell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?I was disgusted by what I saw and full of self-loathing for letting myself get that badly overweight and out of shape. I knew that I was slowly killing myself with my terrible diet and lack of activity. I often isolated myself from others because I could never seem to shake the feeling that I was being judged every time I got around anyone else. It always seemed that all eyes were on me and my size. I hated the way I looked to the point that I felt things had become essentially hopeless for me to ever change anything about myself. Food was my only source of comfort more often than not, and I developed such a sense of shame that I continually went back to this comfort source. This cycle repeated itself so many times it was my crippling normal. I hoped things would get better, but I honestly did not hold out a great deal of hope that they would.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My sons birth was my main motivator to get me started. I teach parenting classes as part of my job, and I would tell everyone in the class how important a fathers example is in a childs life. In my own life, however, I was setting a terrible example. Not only was I on a course to likely deprive my son of a father at a young age, I was also set to teach him my terrible habits and potentially doom him to a similar life. Aside from all those factors, my son was looking at the prospect of having to sit on the sidelines and watch all the other children play with their fathers as I had to sit yet again due to exhaustion. Merely thinking of these factors drove me in the beginning, and as I went along I began to want to keep going for myself as well. I began to realize I deserved to feel better about myself, and frankly just to feel better overall. As more and more goals fell I began to feel unstoppable!What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?My greatest challenge was lack of discipline, which drove me to do the wrong things and avoid the right ones. I was, for lack of better terms, a food addict, and this addiction drove me to seek out foods that were fried, sugary, salty, and/or void of nutrition. I was also not disciplined enough to make exercise a part of my daily life. At 360 pounds, workouts are very difficult, and it takes a tremendous amount of fortitude to keep pushing play. I had great difficulty finding that fortitude at first. Beachbody and its programs have breathed a breath of refreshing hope into my lungs. As I began to eat better and build exercise programs into my life, my numbers on the scale began to get smaller and smaller. This motivated me to keep going and made me realize that if we keep doing the right things only good things will happen to us. I cannot help but feel that Beachbody helped me get my life back, and I cannot express my gratitude enough!What in particular did you like about the program you chose?I liked the portion control aspect as well as the structured workouts. I knew to a degree what to eat and what not to eat, but I was not always sure how much to eat or how to balance it. The 21 Day Fix and 21 Day Fix EXTREME eliminated the guesswork for me, and I now have so much more knowledge about how to fuel my body properly. I also had no idea how to structure an effective workout. I did not have a clue about how to warm up, which moves worked best in concert, and how to cool back down afterward. Shaun T and Autumn showed me the right way to exercise, and they also made it enjoyable enough that I would stick with it long-term. My old haphazard style of exercising has been replaced by effective workouts led by experts, and my colossal increase in results reflects that rather well.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?I have lost [over 160]pounds and likely over 100 inches, but just as importantly I feel as if I have altered my body composition in a pretty dramatic way. I would describe my appearance most of my adult life as being quite doughy. Now I am beginning to see more and more muscle definition. Much of my body fat aside from the last vestiges of stubborn belly fat is all but a thing of the past. I can now wear clothing sizes that once seemed impossible to ever see again. I wore 4X T-shirts much of my adult life, but now I can wear XL, and my jeans have gone from size 44 to size 34. My appearance has altered to the point that I recently stood across from my former neighbor of 22 years and she had no idea it was me! Besides the appearance factor, I am also proud that I can now exert myself without gasping for air. In the past most activities would leave me heavily winded, but now I have to work much harder to become out of breath. I have a long way to go yet, but I have come far!How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?My life has totally changed since I have made Beachbody a part of my life! I used to be consumed by a constant sense of pessimism and a focus on my limitations, but now I look at myself and my life and I see opportunity! I feel so much more confident about myself and my ability to accomplish personal goals than I once did. I have learned to not only set goals for myself, but set big goals for myself. I also feel like I have much more life ahead now, both in quantity and quality! At 360 pounds I knew I was facing a short life if nothing changed, but now I see no reason I cannot reach my 80s or beyond. My remaining years will also be more fruitful as I can engage in far more activities than I once thought possible. I feel like a vastly improved version of my former self, and I cannot imagine how great I will feel as I continue to follow Beachbodys amazing programs!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?I felt as if the Group looked at me as an example of the good results that could be achieved over the long term, and I felt as if I would be letting them down if I faltered. Many of them had also met their personal goals, so I also drew inspiration from their awesome results!How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?He was there to answer any questions about nutrition (my main area of ignorance) and offer words of encouragement. He has been available any time I have needed his guidance, whether it was about nutrition, new programs to purchase, or anything else I needed to ask. He has probably received little compensation for all the work he has done for me, but he has done so with great kindness and respect, and I cannot thank him enough for that!You can change your life, too.

“I’m a Strong Mommy Ninja!”
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/strong-mommy-ninja,"Meet Jessica P, age 29 from Indian Land, SC.She enteredThe Beachbody Challenge and won $2,500!Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?Before Beachbody I was out of shape from 2 C-Sections and losing my gallbladder and appendix in between. Before my babies, I was an obese wreck from years of toxic medications. I had illnesses that made losing weight impossible. Hashimotos Disease = Zero Metabolism. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome = Zero Energy. Fibromyalgia = Severe Pain. All of these illnesses occurred due to a miss-diagnosis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. I was only given 7 years to live. Not good news for a college athlete. During my organ removal a biopsy showed no PBC but now Fatty Liver Disease. From a suggested lack of activity and poor nutrition due to financial hardships. I gained 120 Pounds in my 20s. I was embarrassed and had anxiety attacks if I saw anyone from my Athletic Past. I feared stairs especially with kids in my arms. I needed a miracle. As soon as I was cleared for exercise knowing I had no expiration date I turned to Beachbody Programs, Shakeology, and my Coach Brianne for help.What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?My children are my world. They deserve a Mom who can pass on the Athletic Skills she poses. I want to play at their park as if it were my own. Without fear of busting their equipment. I made a promise to my family that I wouldnt just sit and feed the birds. I want their joys to be filled with happy memories of a fun and athletic mommy enjoying life along their sides. Also, I had some serious rage from the injustices my body has endured through the past decade. I needed to channel the negative energy into erasing the damage. I changed my diet, started pressing play daily, drank Shakeology for breakfast, and instead of a being a spectator I joined the party.What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?I was starting from the bottom and couldnt see the top. I knew I just had to tap into my athlete and just get it done but I was guilty about stealing an hour away from my babies. It hurt my soul. I knew every time I trained I was gaining life to live with them so I did it for our future. I was a skeptic. I tried numerous things that only provided short term results and now was not the time to fail. My mission was finding myself and then making improvements. I did not want to lose the game. This was my time. The programs I followed helped me find my fitness again and aided my diet and nutrition. I no longer fear stairs.Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?60 Pounds + 65 Inches in 4 Months!Im so proud that Slim in 6 + Keep it up, Slim Series + S.S Express destroyed 2 years of pregnancy gain. It helped me address my medical issues so much sooner. Thanks Debbie Siebers!I then lost22 Pounds + 29 Inches in 2 Months.My metabolism shot through the roof. Im so proud this program put my hormones back in balance.Later, I lost28 Pounds + 46 Inches in 4 Months.Muscles do burn fat! My Total Results. 110 Pounds + 140 Inches in 10 Months! Ive lost 18.5 off my Chest, 20 off my Waist, 20 off my Hips, and 25 off my Thighs! Ive lost 21% Body Fat and 20.1 BMI. Jean size was 22/24 now 8/10. T-shirt size was 2xl now medium. Thanks BeachbodyHow has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?Im no longer wearing pregnancy clothing. No more huge elastic waste bands. No more bras with adjustable straps. I can fit into normal clothing from a regular clothing store. No more special ordering bras from risky websites. I no longer cry trying things on because I know they wont fit or the store doesnt carry my size. Beachbody has completely changed my life in every way imaginable. I can recognize myself in the mirror again; there isnt a stranger looking back at me. I love taking my sweaty selfies during my fitness challenges now. I used to dread them. I can do push ups with my 2 year old on my back. Like real push ups not girl push ups. I could probably knock your lights out if I had to defend myself  hehe. And the air I can catch with jumping moves  whoa. 100 pounds lost never to be found again. There is no part of me that hasnt completely transformed. And I love it.I love me My legs dont have fatigue + pain. My back pain has dwindled. Im not scared of stairs and I no longer have panic attacks. I no longer have hypothyroidism or fatty liver disease. I harbor zero negative energy. I can play with my babies using their equipment. Im a Strong Mommy Ninja! Im a complete overhaul. Thanks again Beachbody!!How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?Participating in a Challenge Group helped me reach my goal because these ladies are in the same boat as me. Struggling mothers trying to fit everyone elses busy day into their schedules while trying to better ourselves. The support was fantastic. Ive made life long friends and we are challenging each other in every aspect of life. Just logging on everyday to track food, water, exercise, etc. was enough to keep us accountable and allowed us all to see great results.How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?My Coach helped keep me accountable also made suggestions I wouldnt have thought of to keep me motivated. She shared her journey which inspired me to keep pushing play. Knowing that I wasnt the only one feeling the way I felt and how she was able to turn things around helped me realize it is possible to focus on me, and not feel guilty about taking time away from the family to be able to put fitness and health back into my life. And make me a priority right alongside everyone else. Thanks Coach Brianne!How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?Shakeology has healed me from within. Feeding my body what it needed with superfoods gave me energy for my workouts. My hair and nails feel strong and healthy. My skin is glowing and it isnt from pregnancy or childbirth. My Mommy brain fog has lifted and instead of feeling like Im 2 steps behind trying to catch up, Im always 1 step ahead. It tastes great and is a very versatile product. I also use the 3-Day Refresh. It opened my eyes to what a fruit and veggie portion looks like, and helped me realize if Im ever hungry I can always turn to a low calorie healthy snacks, feel full, and not give into temptations.How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?I no longer have hypothyroidism and have been taken off medications completely. My liver test results show that I am within normal ranges which means I no longer have fatty liver disease. My skin is so healthy. My hair is growing like weeds. My nails are strong. My immune system is strong. My digestion is strong. I am strong. Completely different body inside and out. I have never felt as good as I do today. Shakeology is not only the boost of energy I needed to really make me push hard, it has also healed me from deep within. I am a complete transformation. Mind, body + soul.Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)Ive seen such great results that my doctor said Im now one of her healthiest patients. The opposite from 10 months ago. She is so proud of me she asked for a picture of me tackling the Warrior Dash to post in her office. To help inspire and motivate her other clients! The Beachbody Programs, Shakeology, my Coach Brianne, and Primary Care Physician Dr. Wilson all helped save my life. I shed 110 Pounds + 140 Inches in 10 Months from my Skeleton. Thanks everyone! Happy Mothers Day! You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Ask the Expert: Are Cheat Meals OK?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/ask-expert-cheat-meals-ok,"The Short Answer:Its absolutely OK to have a cheat meal! If the rest of your diet plan is tight, theres nothing wrong with cutting loose once or twice a week. In fact, the shift in calories may help you avoid plateaus. Also, it keeps you sane. After all, life is too short not to eat the occasional donut.The Long Answer:Now that youve stopped twerking for joy around the room and returned to your screen, Ill explain why the occasional cheat meal is OK. As I said, they are a good way to ward off potential plateaus. They also break up the stress commonlyassociated with a diet and keep you on track.Cheat meals fight plateaus.While we live in a modern world, our bodies still operate under some very primitive rules. When you eat at a calorie deficit while working out regularly, your body doesnt get the memo that you could stop at any time. Instead, it assumes youre trudging across a desolate African plain with nary a Souplantation in sight, desperately tracking a wildebeest in hopes of feeding your starving family. (Some might argue that Plyo X offers a similar sensation.)To deal with this stress, your body will sometimes slow down its metabolism and hold on to emergency fuel stores (body fat) to survive. We call this starvation mode and because youre not burning fat, it creates a weight-loss plateau. While the obvious solution is to increase your calories in general, cheat meals are also effective because they give your body a little feast break in the middle of the famine to convince it to keep burning those love handles away.In fact, we often suggest people zigzag their calories from a large deficit to a slight surplus over the course of a week to break this type of plateau. A cheat meal or two, provided the rest of your eating is extremely clean, can create such a zigzag.Cheat meals strengthen willpower.In their excellent book Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength, Dr. Roy Baumeister and science writer John Tierney discuss the concept of decision fatigue, the idea that willpower, just like our muscles, can give out after a while. When asked whether making decisions would deplete their willpower and make them vulnerable to temptation, most people say no. They dont realize that decision fatigue helps explain why ordinary, sensible people get angry at their colleagues and family, splurge on clothes, buy junk food at the supermarket, and cant resist the car dealers offer to rustproof their new sedan.Think of cheat meals the same way you think of recovery days. They give your willpower a chance to rest and restore, reducing the chance that youll fall off the wagon in a bigger way.Cheat meals relieve stress.Survival mode suggests cheat meals relieve physical stress. Decision fatigue suggests they relieve mental stress. Theres also a third type of stress they relieve: emotional stress. Turning around your diet can be really hard. Sometimes, eating clean means youre walking away from foods youve looked to your whole life for comfort, nourishment, celebration, and security. The fact that they are absolute crap and they were slowly killing you is beside the point. They still have an enormous amount of emotional resonance. As long as you dont think itll cause a relapse, theres no reason to completely walk away from cake on your birthday or a hot dog at the baseball game. Whenever Im visiting my parents in Atlanta, you better believe I help myself to my moms epic banana cream pie. In fact, only having it on special occasions makes it all the more delicious.What if I dont want a cheat meal?Although Ive put forth some compelling arguments for a cheat meal, I dont want to strong-arm you into succumbing to temptation. If youre keeping it 100% clean and that works for you, go for it. For some people cold turkey is the only way to avoid stumbling into bad habits.On a semi-side note, a funny thing happens when you eat healthy for a while. Your idea of a cheat meal redefines itself. As a teenager, I could polish off a large meat lovers pizza and two liters of Coke. Today, two slices of veggie pizza, a huge salad, and a 12-ounce craft beer is my idea of indulgence. As for my moms banana cream pie, anything more than a medium-sized slice and I get ill. (You dont want to know how much of it I used to eat.)As you enjoy your cheat meals, pay attention to how your body reacts. When abused, refined sugar is toxic, but most Americans have built up a tolerance. They cant feel how it tears them apart, spiking blood sugar and torquing their hormones. When you dont normally consume it in excess, occasional consumption can make you feel sick. Thats your body telling you to eat less next time.Finally, a couple of cheat meal myths.Some experts claim that binging on a cheat meal to the point of illness is a good thing because it keeps you on the straight and narrow for the rest of the week. This is stupid advice given by fools who dont understand the brief gorging refractory period involved with being a chronic overeater. If a meal makes you sick, youve poisoned yourselfnot something you want to do on a regular basis.Lastly, if someone suggests post-cheat meal tricks to mitigate the damage, dont bother. Its too late. A glass of lemon water or a series of antiquated calisthenics will be about as effective as trying to pop the Goodyear Blimp with a toothpick.So if you think its right for you, go ahead and have a cheat meal. Anticipate it before you eat it, enjoy it while its happening, and own it once its done. Then get back on your horse in the morning."

Transformation Tuesday: Kristen Lost 23 Pounds with ASYLUM!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-kristen-lost-23-pounds-asylum,"KristenK. has a very busy life, and was excited by the idea ofINSANITY: THE ASYLUM, a program so tough her coach said people could barely even finish it.She finished ittwice! She lost 23 pounds and 20 inches over two rounds ofASYLUM. Heres her story, in her own words:I have a 2 year old son and a 9 month old daughter so my life is very busy. I had been a coach for 2 years and decided after the birth of my daughter I needed to get in shape again. I was told I had to wait 6 weeks before doing any workout program since I had a c-section. Itwas very hard for me to look in the mirror and see the extra weight that I had gained, but I knew with motivation and determination through Beachbody I would be able to achieve my goals.In two years I had two surgeries and I was told multiple times to rest and wait on any workout program. I wanted to change my lifestyle and when I was given the go-aheadto start working out, I was beyond ready.Getting up and pushing play was the hardest since sleep was lacking with a baby, but after I started to see results in the mirror and my clothes were fitting again it became easier. It took a year to lose the weight aftermy first child, but my eating plans and workout challenges made this weight loss easier!I was given INSANITY: ASYLUM Vol.1 by my coach and was told, Here, try this 30 day challenge. Just to let you know,most dont finish the program. Well, I was going to show my coach- I was going to finish this challenge, and I did! I loved it, so I purchased INSANITY: ASYLUM Vol. 2! I love having a schedule to follow and needed to start something new since I was in this workout routine. My husband, who is in great shape, started working out with me at 5:15 AM everyday because he could see the difference in how I felt and looked!This is a fast-paced challenge. I love the way you feel after working out and the sweat dripping off your face knowing Wow, did I just do that! The name INSANITY comes not from being able to do the insane moves, but from how it takes over your body and mind and makes you want to workout!I love my stomach! I had a baby 9 months ago via c-section, and look at my definition and without doing hundreds of sit-ups daily. My arms show that multiple push-ups pay off. Who knew that push-ups would be the easiest part of the program?I have confidence in myself now. I feel as though I can take on a challenge and actually complete it. The results are rewarding. When others ask mehow Ilost the weight so fast I reply, Beachbody and determination. I post pictures of my journey on my Facebook page and when the family goes out, people come up to me and say, I have been following you and you are a big motivation for me! My husband replied, I didnt realize you had so many fans. This makes me feel good, knowing I am helping others too.SharesYou can change your life, too.

Transformation Tuesday: Ann Lost 67 Pounds with INSANITY
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday,"Check out Anns amazingINSANITY transformation! In three rounds, she lost 67 pounds and 37.5 inches! What an accomplishment! Check out her story in her own words:I gained 70 lbs duringmy 3rd pregnancy, and I was put on bed rests at 27 weeks and had torefrain from any physical activity. After giving birth I felt weak, tired all the time, and didnt feel good inside and out. I was not myself! I was struggling just to get up a flight of stairs. After I had my complete physical my cholesterol was out of control and my blood pressure increased significantly. Having family history of Coronary Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and High Blood Pressure and my doctor recommended I take cholesterol medication to control it. As a nurse I refused (medical people are the worst patients)- I wanted to work on my health my own way, the natural way.As a nurse I felt its my job to inspire my patients as well as others to live a healthy lifestyle. I felt like I couldnt teach my patients healthy lifestyle if I couldnt do it myself. I wanted to lead by example and be able to run around and play with my kids. Im always up for a good challenge, but mostly I wanted to do it for myself. I wanted to be a good example for my kids and wanted to be around long enough to see them grow. I also wanted to feel great again, feel the energy and live actively. I must say that watching the Team Beachbody infomercials inspired me, the success stories and before and after photos are amazing and I said to myself, If they can do it, I can do it.Isaw an infomercial for INSANITY. I thought to myself, My goodness that looks like a challenge. I wonder if I can do that? The funny part is, I wanted to do it because I wanted to earn the T-shirt that says I earned it. To me, that was the trophy I could show around. And I knew I was going to be up for a challenge. After I purchased the program I met my coach, and she definitely helped me. Hearing about her own success story and seeing how amazing she looks now just motivated me even more.I like INSANITY for the cardio, and it challenges me to push myself. I dont get bored. Its the combination of cardio and core exercise that I like, and it targets all muscle groups with no equipment required. When I first started even if I could finish just half the workout, you know Igot my workout by how much Isweat and how intense Ifelt.I no longer shop in Plus size anymore! I used to be a 1X and now I shop in the junior sections! I am proud that I am able to do the extreme workout and from zero push ups I can now do all sorts of push ups. I loved the program so much that I became INSANITY certified this year andamproud to teach the program and help people.I definitely feel more alive! I have a lot of energy and I look forward everyday to my different workout programs. Since completing the program and asan instructor I can use my own success story to help other people. Its great to see more and more people coming in on a regular basis and knowing that people are willing to travel a little bit more just to take my class is very rewarding.Taking the Beachbody Challenge was the best decision Ive made for myself. Seeing the before and after results motivated me. Seeing people posting their workout, food and the support you get from everyone definitely helped me push through.I have Shakeology for dinner every night and I absolutely love it!

Transformation Tuesday: Ashley Lost 34 Pounds with PiYo and FOCUS T25!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-ashley-lost-34-pounds-piyo-focus-t25,"Ashley was a new mom who had just given birth to her third child. When she found the weight was not dropping off as easily as it had with her first two children, she foundPiYoandFOCUS T25to help her get back in shape. In 4 months, she lost 34 lbs and 25 inches! Read her story in her own words, below:In November 2013, I gave birth to my thirdbaby. After my first two pregnancies, the pregnancy weight quickly fell off. Once I had given birth to my third, I realized the weight was not going anywhere. I developed poor eating habits during pregnancy (eating for two, right?!) and they continued after his birth.I was tired not just new mom tired, but completely exhausted. I had promised my older two children that after the baby was born, I would have more energy and be able to play like I had before, but I couldnt. There was so much guilt. Guilt for letting myself get to this point, for letting my children down, for setting a poor example for them.I reluctantly borrowed some size 16 pants from a friend because I refused to buy a larger size when I had a closet full of size 10 clothes that I would eventually fit into right? Wrong. The pants fit. It was a sad realization for me of how much I needed this change.I decided to fully commit to transforming my life.I began with PiYo. I stuck to the workout schedule and the nutrition guide. I lost 6 lbs my first week!I lost weight every weekafter. More than that, I lost inches week after week. Once I had completed PiYo, I started Focus T25. Every week, I kept expecting to see that weight loss plateau but it didnt! I just kept losing and I kept getting stronger.My diet did a complete 180. I am eating clean and being an example for my children. Theyre even starting to eat the vegetables without too many complaints! Through eating clean, drinkingShakeology, and daily exercise, I have all of the energy I had hoped for, that I was certain I would never have again! I thought I might never be myself again before I started with Beachbody, butI finally feel like I am back to the person I was long ago!I can keep up with my kids and I am not begging for daily naps.My strength, flexibility, and endurance have improved drastically. In total, I have lost 34 lbs (20 lbs with PiYo and an additional 14 lbs with T25) and 25 inches! Losing 6 inches in your waist and 7 inches in your hips is shocking! I dropped from those size 16 pants all the way down to a size 8! I feel amazing.I can be the mom I promised my children I would be. I am committed to a healthy lifestyle and I am ready to tackle the next challenge!You can change your life, too. Take theBeachbody Challenge, for the ultimate motivation to get fit!

The pig replies, Thats fine, but while youre making a contribution, Im making a real commitment!The same adage holds true to anyone trying to get in (and stay in) shape. If you simply get involved in your nutrition and fitness plan, and contribute some time and effort toward living healthy, you will most likely achieve some results. You may feel stronger, more confident, and pleased with your progress. However, these feelings wont compare to the satisfaction youll experience if you are 100% committed to each training session and meal.Committing wholeheartedly to your health is not easy. There will be times when youll experience temporary physical, psychological, or emotional discomfort. You may feel torn between ordering that 350-calorie blended coffee drink or unsweetened peppermint tea. You may be hesitant to attempt more pull-ups today than you did last week for fear of failing. We all struggle to eat healthy when you have a late night craving (trust me, Ive been there). In these moments of weakness, its only natural to want to waver on your commitment to the goals you set. But committing to your plan makes it possible to admire yourself both inside and out. Youll stand more confidently. Youll feel sexier. Youll discover your true sense of well-being, purpose, and personal worth. Youll feel grounded, energized, and intact. Youll simply be happier in mind, body, and spirit.Here are three ways to help you stay committed to achieving your goals that can help you stay strong when youre struggling:1. Post your goals on your bathroom mirror.Posting your short-term daily goals in a place where you automatically see them each day will help you to stay focused, motivated, and committed to staying on task. Your bathroom mirror is the perfect place because youll see your goals first thing in the morning and right before you go to sleep at night. For greater results, also post your primary purpose for setting your goals (e.g., wanting to have more energy to play with your kids, to go on an adventure trip, to live longer, to feel more confident, etc.).2. Prepare daily for what-ifs.Before your day begins, ask yourself if there are any challenges that may interfere with your daily goals. For example, what if you get called in to a last-minute lunch meeting? What if your child asks you to play during the time you blocked off for training? What if youre going out to celebrate a friends birthday? For each what-if make a plan to cope with the challenge while still staying committed to your fitness and nutrition. Of course, there are plenty of uncontrollable distractions, but strategizing on how to cope with your most common challenges will set you up to deal with anything that happens during you day.3. Journal your daily effort.There is no doubt that tracking your nutrition and fitness improves your chances of achieving your goals. But I recommend also keeping a diary in which you answer the following question each day: Did I exert every ounce of effort to achieving my goals today? If your answer is yes, great! If your answer is no, write down one thing you can do tomorrow to be better than you were today.When you follow these three tips, your level of commitment for fitness and nutrition will skyrocket, giving you the best shot at achieving your goals and feeling ultimate satisfaction. Better yet, when these three tips become part of your daily ritual, not only will you achieve your goals, but get results that will last!What are your tips and tricks to staying committed to reaching your goals?"

39 Great Supermarket Foods
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/great-supermarket-foods,"Rule #13: Shop the Periphery of the Supermarket and Stay Out of the Middle.Michael Pollan,Food RulesShopping for ingredients can be daunting. Even if you take noted nutrition writer Michael Pollans advice and stick to the perimeter of the store, where you can gather your fresh produce, dairy products, and meat (or better yet, shop at a farmers market), what about when youneedto venture into the center aisles, where youll find packaged and processed goods for, say, condiments or chicken broth? Which deli meat is nitrite free? Which veggie burgers arent chock full of filler?Some of the food products out there are downright scary, so to help you navigate the grocery store minefielddangerous territory that extends to the deli section and the dairywe sent our intrepid reporters to examine the many brands out there, in hopes of finding the best food products* available at most supermarkets or online. An interesting discovery during our investigation: Not all food products created by the same brand earned our thumbs up. Some were okay, others were not. These suggestions are not exhaustivethere are a lot of great products out there. If you cant find the products we mention below, read the label first. Not sure if a product is ok? Ask us in the comments below.Before your next trip to the supermarket, print out the list at the end of this article and bring it with you. Youll save time and avoid the weird stuff.CONDIMENTS & SPREADSKetchupKetchup, while delicious, is not the best condiment for you. By nature, it contains a sweetenerwhether thats sugar, cane syrup, or (gasp) high fructose corn syrup.Our Pick:Whole Foods 365 Organic Tomato Ketchup ($1.99/24 oz.)The Whole Foods brand of ketchup contains only the ingredients ketchup needs to be ketchuptomato puree, evaporated cane juice, white vinegar, salt, onion powder, and spices. If you dont have a Whole Foods nearby, Heinzs Simply Heinz is the next best option, as it contains sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. The best way to know exactly what is in your ketchup is to make your own. Try this easy homemade ketchup recipe.MustardMustard is an almost calorie-free way to give a flavor boost to sauces and proteins. But some mustards also include natural flavors. And because natural flavors are not always natural,1,2were going with the one that doesnt have them.Our Pick:Morehouse Yellow Mustard ($2.49/20 oz.)Morehouses Yellow Mustard contains only distilled vinegar, mustard seed, sea salt, turmeric, paprika, and spices. Were okay with spices being left a mystery because food labeling laws require these ingredients to be from thislist of seasonings.3MayonnaiseReal mayonnaise is made from eggs, oil, and sometimes lemon juice or vinegar. Most store brands stray pretty far from this recipe. Miracle Whip adds high fructose corn syrup, natural flavor, and potassium sorbate (a synthetic preservative that is also used in industrial coatings4). Best Foods/Hellmanns adds calcium sodium EDTA.Our Pick:Spectrum Organic Mayonnaise ($3.99/11.25 oz.)Spectrum makes several mayonnaises that meet our high standard. All of the ingredients are organic and are actually food.Hot SauceHot sauce adds flavor, but can also add unnecessary sugar or sodium.Our Pick:Tabasco Pepper Sauce ($2.49/2 oz.)It doesnt take a lot of ingredients to turn up the heat. Classic Tabasco only has three ingredients: red peppers, salt, and distilled vinegar. Many Mexican hot sauces come in a healthy(ish) second. All you need to do is read the ingredients list.Soy SauceTheres no getting around the fact that soy sauce is loaded with sodium. But, grab a random bottle from the shelf and it might also include modified food starch or sugar.Our Pick:Kikkoman Low-Sodium Soy Sauce ($3.49/10 oz.)This soy sauce is tasty, though dont mistake it for a low-sodium food! We dont love that it includes sodium benzoate and lactic acid, but weve seen worse. If you have a Trader Joes nearby, theirs is best as it contains only water, soybeans, wheat, and salt. Plus, it has 460mg of sodium (vs. Kikkomans 575 mg).Peanut ButterPeanut butter thats perfectly smooth and spreadable (even the crunchy kind) is made with added hydrogenated vegetable oil or palm oil (and usually a ton of sugar). Dont want to stir your all-natural peanut butter every time you eat it? We dont either. Stir it once, and then store it in your fridge.Our Pick:Laura Scudders All-Natural Peanut Butter ($3.29/16 oz.)Laura Scudders All-Natural Peanut Butter contains only peanuts and touch of salt. It is also available in organic and unsalted varieties.JamThe jam, jelly, and fruit preserves aisle is full of trouble. Reach willy-nilly for any jam jar on the shelf and you might be picking up a jar of fruit laced with high fructose corn syrup, tons of added sugar, aspartame, and Red 40.Our Pick:St. Dalfour ($3.99/10 oz.)St. Dalfour is pure, old-fashioned fruit spread: fruit, fruit juice, and pectin (a natural thickener). A widely available alternative, Bonne Maman Fruit Preserves ($4.99/13 oz.), gets high marks from us for its real fruit flavor and similarly simple recipe (they sweeten with sugar instead of juice).Salad DressingThe best way to have healthysalad dressingis to make it from scratch. Otherwise you risk ingesting a wide range of nasty stuff like corn syrup, artificial colors, and phosphoric acida tangy-tasting corrosive chemical.5We found all of these ingredients in Kraft Free Caesar Italian).Our Pick:Annies Naturals Balsamic Vinaigrette ($3.99/8 oz.)Annies Naturals uses common, known ingredients: water, oil, vinegar, honey, mustard, and salt.DAIRY & NON-DAIRYGreek YogurtGreek yogurts are made from the same stuff as regular yogurt, are strained to achieve a thicker consistency, and contain more protein. For the most part, they all get our stamp of approval.Our Picks:Fage Total 0% Plain ($6.99/32 oz.)orChobani Nonfat Plain ($6.49/32 oz.)The key is to buyplainGreek yogurt and add your own fresh fruit or honey. Heres why. In those little pre-flavored cups, theres a lot of added sugar. 8 ounces of plain nonfat Fage has 100 calories, 23 g of protein, and 6 g of sugar (from the milk). One 5.3-oz. container of Blueberry Fage has 120 calories, 13 g of protein, and 16 g of sugar (from the milk, blueberries, and added sugar). Eating more yogurt and consuming more protein, fewer calories, and less sugar sounds good to us.Regular YogurtOnce again, plain is best. The flavored yogurts we inspected contained a lot more than the fruits showcased on the labels. Light yogurts were even worse with ingredient labels that listed aspartame, gelatin, and modified cornstarch.Our Pick:DANNON all-natural plain nonfat yogurt ($4.19/32 oz.)DANNON plain nonfat yogurt contains 100 calories and 11 grams of protein per cup. The only ingredients? Cultured Grade A nonfat milk, live active cultures (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, bifidus, L. caseithe bacteria strains that make yogurt yogurt), and pectin (a thickener made from fruit).A side note: Though we mostly recommend the low-fat and nonfat dairy products in our guides and recipes, its OKAY to eat full-fat dairy products. Theyre less processed than their nonfat cousins.Cottage CheeseNearly every Beachbody program nutrition guide includes cottage cheese, because it is a low-calorie, protein-rich, versatile anytime snack. But some brands of low-fat cottage cheese also contain suspect ingredients like modified food starch, mono- and diglycerides, and artificial color.Our Pick:Daisy Low-fat Cottage Cheese ($3.29/16 oz.)Daisy Low-fat Cottage Cheese contains only milk, cream, salt, and vitamin A palmitate (a plant-based source of vitamin A added to replace the nutrients lost when fat is removed). Want to avoid the palmitate? Eat the full-fat version.Cream CheeseSpreadable cream cheese packs big flavor and protein in just a tablespoon or two. But some brands, like Weight Watchers, contain extra ingredients like maltodextrin and inulin (a sweetener). Flavored cream cheeses often contain artificial flavors and colors.Our Pick:Organic Valley ($4.29/8 oz.)Organic is always best, especially when it comes to dairy. Organic Valley cream cheese is made from organic milk, organic cream, organic lactose powder, salt, and organic locust bean guma natural thickener made from carob seeds.6If you cant spring for organic, we also recommend Philadelphia Original Cream Cheese ($2.29/8 oz.).Half and HalfTechnically, half and half is a blend of cream and milk, but many brands add color, preservatives, corn syrup, and mono- and diglycerides. Fat-free versions replace cream with fillers, emulsifiers, and chemicals.Our Pick:Horizon Organic Half & Half ($2.99/pint)Horizon Organic Half & Half contains only organic Grade A whole milk and organic cream. If you have a hankering for flavors, try adding a few drops of all-natural vanilla, rum, or hazelnut extract instead of flavored creamers.Soy MilkEver looked at the ingredient list on non-dairy milk? Theres a lot there that might cause your eyebrow (and your blood sugar) to rise, including all kinds of sugars and preservatives.Our Pick:Organic Edensoy ($2.39/32 oz)Organic Unsweetened Edensoy contains two ingredients: water and organic soybeans. Plus, it has 12 grams of protein and only 5 mg of sodium per 8-oz. serving (compared to 7 g and 70 mg in Silk).Almond MilkWith just 30 calories per serving, almond milk has one-third the calories of nonfat milk. Made from scratch, it contains only almonds and water, but some brands recipes include a long list of other ingredients, including sugars.Our Pick:Pacific Almond Milk ($2.99/32 oz.)This almond milk contains almonds, sea salt, vanilla, rice starch, carrageenan (from seaweed), and natural flavors. Plus, its fortified with the same nutrients as milk. Welltake it.Rice MilkRice milk is a simple beverage at its core. Thats why we were surprised to see so many extra ingredients and sweeteners in some brands. However, unlike other milk alternatives, rice milk has low nutritional value and provides very little protein. It is not our first choice for your balanced diet.Our Pick:Rice Dream ($1.69/32 oz.)Rice Dream has a handful of ingredients (water, brown rice, expeller pressed high oleic safflower oil, and sea salt), and we like that its made from brown rice.BREAD PRODUCTSBreadManythough not allbreads that claim to be whole-grain contain processed flours, sugars, and dough conditioners, and that is just the beginning.Our Pick:Food for Life 7 Sprouted Grains Bread ($3.49/24 oz.)Why? Whats in it: brown rice, whole sprouted grains and lentils, wheat gluten, and sea salt. Everything is organic, and each slice has 80 calories, 3 g of fiber, 4 g of protein, and 0.5 g of fat. They also offer a gluten-free version. Another option? Freshly baked, whole-grain bread from your local bakery.English MuffinsThomas whole wheat English muffins contain preservatives, artificial color, and a host of chemicals including azodicarbonamide, a bleaching agent that is used in plastics and which is banned for food use inof all placesEngland!Our Pick:Food for Life 7 Sprouted Grains English Muffins ($4.59/6 muffins)Like their bread, Food for Lifes English muffins contain only organic sprouted grains, yeast, gluten, and salt. Half of one muffin has 80 calories, 4 g of protein, and 3 g of fiber.Whole-Grain TortillasMany whole-grain tortillas, like Mission multi-grain flour tortillas, look deceptively healthy, but are made with evil hydrogenated oils, sugar, preservatives, and chemical dough conditioners.Our Pick:Food for LifeEzekiel 4:9 Taco Size Whole-Grain TortillasFood for Lifes tortillas are made from organic sprouted grains, seeds, lentils, water, sea salt, and nothing else. Their ideal size (80 calories, 3 g protein, and 2 g fiber) and clean ingredients list make them the healthiest choice for wraps and personal pizzas.Hamburger BunsEvery hamburger bun we inspected contained a long list of undesirable ingredients like ethoxylated diglycerides, high fructose corn syrup, and chemical dough conditioners.Our Pick:Food for Life Sprouted Whole-Grain Burger BunsFood for Life is the clear winner of the bread category. Their buns are made from organic sprouted 100% whole wheat and 100% whole wheat flour (always look for the 100%). Or you can use freshly baked bread. Just check the ingredients before you purchase.CerealWe picked up nearly every box in the cereal aisle, reaching instinctively for cereals we thought were made with basic ingredientsthey werentand ogling the crazy ingredient lists on some: brown rice syrup, cane syrup, high fructose corn syrup, preservatives, fillers, artificial colors, coatings, refined flours.Our Pick:Engine 2 Rips Big Bowl ($4.99/13-oz. box)This was our greatest find of the day. After giving up hope that an ideal breakfast cereal existed, we found this little red box and snatched one for further research. Its hearty whole and sprouted grains and flakes did not disappoint. Their Triple Berry Walnut cereal contains real fruit (actual strawberries and blackberries!) that provides a hint of sweetness. There are no added sweeteners of any kind. They have a diet plan that we dont necessarily endorse for everyone, but we cant say enough good things about their cereal.Frozen WafflesWhen it comes to frozen waffles, were not touching the highly processed yellow variety (seriously, they add artificial yellow color). But even some whole-grain waffles can add sugar and preservatives to your most important meal of the day.Our Pick:Kashi 7-Grain Waffles ($3.49/8 waffles)We chose these because, while they do contain sugar from cane juice and molasses, two of their whole-grain waffles have more protein (4 g) and fiber (7 g) than other brands. Serve with fruit instead of syrup.Pancake MixTony Horton likens pancakes to eating birthday cake for breakfast. And its no wonder why. Original Bisquick is made from processed flour and partially hydrogenated oils. Top that with butter and maple syrup and youre on your way to fewer birthday cakes in the long run.Our Pick:Baker Mills Kodiak Cakes ($5.99/24 oz.)We were impressed by the 100% whole-grain flour, 7 g of protein, and 4 g of fiber per serving of Baker Mills Kodiak Cakes mix. Sweetened only with honey, it contains no preservatives or industrial sweeteners.PROTEINSPrepackaged Deli Turkey or HamLuncheon meats can be scary territory in the grocery store. What looks like sliced turkey breast is often poultry pieces that have been ground into a paste, processed with chemical binders and nitrites, flavored with corn syrup and artificial flavors, and molded into a cylinder, then sliced. Ew. Whats the big deal about nitrites and why do we suggest all your meats be nitrite-free? Because nitrates and nitrites have been linked to increased risk of cancer,7 heart disease, and diabetes.8Our Pick:Applegate FarmsApplegates packaged deli products are made from cage-free animals that were never treated with hormones or antibiotics. Their meats have no nitrites or fillers and stick to the basicssliced protein, water, salt, and carrageenan obtained from seaweed.Vegetarian BurgersA vegetarian diet is supposed to be good for you. Which is why some of the ingredients in veggie burgers were so shocking. Artificial flavor? Modified vegetable gum? Natural butter flavor?Our Pick:Asherahs Gourmet Vegan Burgers ($4.99/4 burgers)Made from organic quinoa, organic sweet potatoesorganic everything down to the spices. Each patty has 180 calories, 190 mg of sodium, 30 g of carbs, 5 g of fat, and 6 g of protein. Our second choice, Original Sunshine Burgers, are also packed with organic goodness. These are made from sunflower seeds, so each burger is higher in fat and calories, but provides double the protein (350 calories, 21 g of fat, 12 g of protein).Hot DogsHot dogs are famously made from mystery meat. This takes on new meaning now that the world has been introduced to the horrors of pink slime and horsemeat. Then there are all the artificial flavors, preservatives, sodium, chemical fillers, and corn syrup.Our Pick:Applegate Great Organic Beef Hot Dogs ($4.99/8 franks)Applegate Farms links contain only organic grass-fed beef and organic spices. At 110 calories per link, 8 g of fat, and 330 mg of sodiumand the knowledge that their animals are cage- and crate-freewhen it comes to hot dogs, these are a good choice.DIPS, SAUCES, & SOUPHummusHummus is easy to make and we recommend that.Heres oneyou can try. But if youre going to buy prepared hummus, selecting one that is close to how you would make it from scratch is best.Our Pick:Haigs Hummus ($3.79/8 oz.)Haigs original hummus contains garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, water, garlic, spices, and salt. With four flavors to choose from, you wont get bored.ApplesauceApplesauce is a tasty way to add fruit to your diet, as long as its all-natural. Motts and Musselmans add high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar to some of their applesauces.Our Pick:Santa Cruz Organic Applesauce ($3.89/23 oz.)Apples are one the most insecticide-treated fruits, so youll definitely want to buy organic. Santa Cruz Organic Applesauce contains only organic apples and vitamin C, for freshness.Jarred SalsaSalsa is the healthy mans condiment of choice. But some are healthier than others. We passed on Pace Picante Sauce because it has 250 mg of sodium per serving.Our Pick:Newmans Own Medium Salsa ($3.49/16 oz.)Look for jarred salsa without any added sugar, excessive salt, or preservatives. We chose Newmans Own for its all-natural ingredients and lower sodium content (105 mg/2 Tbsp.). It does have added sugar, but only 1 g per serving.SoupSoup is filling, often low in calories, and can help you feel satisfied. But, canned soup can be extremely high in sodium, and contain ingredients like hydrolyzed corn protein. A classic like Campbells Regular Chicken and Rice contains MSG and mechanically separated chicken.Our Pick:Amys Light in Sodium Soups ($3.49/can)From Butternut Squash to Minestrone to Chicken Noodle, all of these soups are made with the same ingredients your grandmother would put in soupalong with the occasional addition of cane juice. Each can has two servings.COMPONENTSChicken StockPrepared chicken stock can be aggressively high in sodium and may even contain MSG! Not to mention corn syrup and artificial flavorings.Our Pick:Pacific Organic Free Range Low-Sodium Chicken Broth ($3.99/32 oz.)Making chicken stock at home is best. And its not hard. But, if you have to buy one, Pacific Organic makes the best we found, even though it does contain chicken flavor. Whatever that is.Vegetable StockAs with chicken stock, making your own is best and can be done with as little as an onion, some celery, a carrot, and water.Our Pick:Kitchen Basics Vegetable Cooking Stock, Unsalted ($3.99/32 oz.)Made from just vegetables, its hard to find a better option. Cant find it at your local store? Its available online.BreadcrumbsDo your breadcrumbs contain ammonium sulfate? Progressos do. Besides being a dough conditioner, ammonium sulfates other uses include plant fertilizer, herbicide, and fire extinguisher powder.9Our Pick:Ians Whole Wheat Panko Breadcrumbs ($3.59/9 oz.)Ians Whole Wheat Panko Breadcrumbs contain only unbleached whole wheat flour, malt extract, yeast, and sea salt. Basically, theyre made of bread.Marinara SauceIf you cant find the time to make simple marinara sauce from canned tomatoes, make sure your jarred sauce is made from natural ingredients and is low in sodium and added sugars. Hunts Traditional Marinara Sauce sneaks in high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup,andsugar. Many jarred sauces cut corners by using soybean oil instead of olive oil.Our Pick:Silver Palate Low-Sodium Marinara Pasta Sauce ($5.29/25 oz.)This award-winning marinara sauce has no added sugar or soybean oil. It has ingredients that should be in marinara saucetomatoes, olive oil, onions, carrots, and garlicand is sweetened with pear concentrate instead of sugar.OlivesOlives are high in iron and vitamin E and impart a nice umami to your salad or sandwich. Kalamata olives are higher in sodium than black olives but, unlike that popular variety, they dont contain ferrous gluconate, an additive that turns green or brown olives jet black and can upset sensitive stomachs. 10Our Pick:Early California Pitted Kalamata Greek Olives ($5.49/6 oz.)Early Californias Pitted Kalamata Greek Olives contain the essential ingredients: olives, water, salt, and red wine vinegar.SNACKSCrackersCrackers can be packed with all sorts of scientific-sounding ingredients that help them last indefinitely in packaging. Trying to find whole-grain ones? Good luck.Our Pick:Wasa Hearty Grain or Whole Grain ($2.99/21 crispbreads)Wasa crispbreads are tasty even though they contain just the basics: whole grains, salt, water, and yeast. Their size, hearty crunch, and versatility with toppings make them a good choice for healthy snacks and small meals too!Tortilla ChipsIf you want salsa and chips, try baked chips. Theyre lower in fat than their fried cousins and still have that satisfying crunch.Our Pick:Guiltless Gourmet Unsalted ($2.99/7 oz.)These contain just organic yellow corn, oil (canola, safflower, or sunflower), and lime. With just 26 mg of sodium per serving and 120 calories for 18 chips, you can snack without feeling guilty. We recommend serving the correct portion of chips in a bowl rather than digging into the whole bag.Beef JerkyJerky is made with salt and sugartheres no getting around that. Avoid brands that use additives like MSG, oleoresin, hydrolyzed soy protein, and sodium erythorbate, and whatever you do,do notsnap into a Slim Jim.Our Pick:Oberto All Natural Beef Jerky (6.99/3.25 oz.)Oberto All Natural Jerkies are seasoned and preserved with ingredients you would have in your own home, like salt, sugar, vinegar, and beef stock. This brands worst offense is natural smoke flavor. Their turkey jerky is up to snuff as well. Just remember, those small bags are not single servings!Iced TeaTea leaves, waterand voila! How could something so simple have gone so wrong? Look at the ingredients list of many bottled iced teas and youll see added sugar, sucralose, aspartame, or acesulfame potassium. Youll also see 150 calories and 38 grams of sugar per serving.Our Pick:Tejava Iced Tea ($2.09/liter)We stumbled onto Tejava a few years ago and havent looked back. When it comes to iced tea, this is our hands-down favorite. This microbrewed black tea is simply delicious and refreshing on ice. It contains nothing but brewed handpicked tea leavesno sweeteners, no fillers, no added flavors.

Ask the Expert: What Are Probiotics and Why Do You Need Them?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/ask-expert-probiotics-need,"The short answer:Your gut is filled with bacteria, good and bad. Good bacteria aids digestion, boosts immunity, and combats a number of gut-related illnesses. Emerging research shows it may also impact weight loss and influence mood. Bad bacteria hampers good bacteria and can make you sick in an assortment of ways, oftentimes involving repeated trips to the bathroom.The two fight constantly.Probiotics contain good bacteria. Youll find them either in supplement form or through real foods like yogurt, tempeh, kimchi, miso, and kombucha. By taking them, youre fortifying the troops. While theyre generally an excellent idea, theyre particularly important after youve had an infection or youve taken a round of antibiotics, because these things tend to wipe out the populations in your gut.The long answer:The therapeutic use of probiotics is an excellent example of ancient wisdom existing long before Western science could pull its head out. There are references to curdled milk in the Bible (Genesis 18:8 and Isaiah 7:15 if youre keeping score), but the party really got started around the start of the 20th century when Nobel Prizewinning scientist Dr. Elias Metchnikoff reported that Bulgarian shepherds tended to live almost twice as long as urban Parisians where he was living. He pinned this on the formers intake of fermented milk, which he felt contained good and anti-putrefactive microorganisms.Its unclear how Metchnikoff made the connection between these two rather disparate groups, but it gave birth to the modern investigation of probiotics, so lets not complain. For the last hundred plus years, science continues to discover more and more good things about the bugs living in our intestines.The 100 trillion (give or take a trillion) bacteria that live in your gut can be divided into over 500 types. Many of the important ones fall into one of two genera, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Under that, there are several species, many of which have specific benefits. For example, Lactobacillus acidophilus has been shown to be especially effective in combating lactose intolerance and Montezumas Revenge (or travelers diarrhea if you want to be boring about it). However, unless you have a specific issue that youre trying to address, you probably dont need to stress about all the species.Fun fact one: the bad bacteria youre working to keep in check include Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and salmonella.Fun fact two: were born without bacteria in our guts, but the populating begins when we pass through the birth canal. Our first gasps of air provide yet more bacteria, as does breast milk, which is especially rich in probiotics.Its well-established that probiotic consumption helps with almost any intestinal issue you can think of, including constipation, lactose intolerance, GI infections, gas, diarrhea, Crohns disease, IBS, and IBD. Its been shown to be effective in treating vaginal and urinary tract infections and atopic eczema. Theres also research showing probiotics may reduce the risk of colon cancer.There are a few theories as to how this all happens. One is that good bacteria simply take up the space in the gut that the bad bacteria would take over. Theres also the fact that some good bacteria stimulate the immune system by promoting the release of various white blood cells that kill pathogens. A third idea is that many bacteria use the same fuel sources. For example, Clostridium difficile, which causes diarrhea and inflames the colon, is dependent on sugarbut so are many good bacteria. It all comes down to balance. If you have plenty of good bacteria in your gut, theyre going to dominate the monosaccharide buffet.Look beyond GI issues, and current science on gut bacteria and probiotics gets even more amazing. A Washington University study on identical twinsone overweight and one thinshowed that they had entirely different gut microbiota, suggesting certain bacteria in your system promotes weight gain. (A separate UC Berkeley study suggests the evolutionary reason for this is that people in northern climates need more body fat, so their gut bacteria actually shifts to promote weight gain.)But if you think popping the right probiotics will soon be the key to dropping pounds, dont get too excited. Yet another study on mice shows that weight loss bacteria doesnt seem to thrive on a high in saturated fat, low-fiber diet. However, they tend to propagate when fed a diet filled with fruits and veggies.Researchers are also looking seriously into the gut-brain axis. In other words, those little bugs in your belly might actually have a say in your decision-making process. For instance, gut bacteria produce 95% of your serotonin, a powerful feel-good neurotransmitter.And a Texas Tech University study on mice found that feeding mice the bad bacterium Campylobacter jejuni drove up their anxiety levels.So, yes, you should consume probiotics. How many depends on your situation. Antibiotics wipe out the microbes in your gut, so a supplement is an excellent idea after a round of those. Beyond that, if you have a gut-related issue, its worth researching which probiotic might help and supplement thusly.Quality probiotic supplements can be pricey though. For most people, a solid diet filled with probiotic foods should do the trick. (For the record, Shakeology contains Bacillus coagulans, an especially hearty probiotic that can survive at room temperature when many probiotics require refrigeration.)Yogurt is also a great source. However, its important to read the label. The bacteria that make the flavor and texture that Western society considers yogurt cant survive the voyage through our GI tract, so manufacturers enhance the stuff with other strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum.Kombucha, or fermented tea, is another great probiotic food thats especially trendy right now. It may take a while to learn to appreciate its tangy taste, but its worth it. Another benefit of kombucha is that its incredibly simple to make.Beyond that, there are tons of other foods out there that are technically probiotic, including tempeh, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, and various cheeses. Unfortunately, these foods are often heated or pasteurized in such a way that kills the bacteria, so check on the label to verify if the probiotics are still active. Another option is to seek out a boutique producer who deliberately maintains the bacteria in their foods. Or you might want to make them yourself. Sandor Ellix Katzs The Art of Fermentation is an excellent resource for your bacterial DIY needs.On a final note, remember that fruit and veggie thing a few paragraphs up? Well, it applies to all the benefits of probiotics. Gut bacteria thrives on certain foods called prebiotics, so its crucial to make them part of your diet. Foods especially high in prebiotics include asparagus, onion, leek, garlic, artichokes, oats, and bananas. Yacon root, which youll find in Shakeology, also contains prebiotics.So make prebiotics and probiotics a cornerstone of your diet because if youre good to all those little bugs in your gut, theyll return the favor tenfold.Do you have a question for our experts?

How ASYLUM Can Spike Your Fitness
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/how-asylum-can-spike-your-fitness,"THE ASYLUM Volumes 1 and 2 may be billed as athletic training, but in reality theyre far more than that. Those ready to withstand their rigors will find a veritable fountain of youth. Lets lift the hood on Shaun Ts latest exercise programs to see if youre ready to get in the game.ASYLUM Volumes 1 and 2 mimic athletic training, but these programs are not just for athletes. The movements youll learn are the same you use in your day-to-day life to stand up, sit down, clean house, do yard work, and so on. These movement patterns regress as we age, both naturally and because we stop pushing our limits. Training with THE ASYLUM will awaken long-dormant neuromuscular connections that will have you moving in ways you may not have done since you were a kid. There is a catch, though: Youre going to have to work for it.How is ASYLUM different from INSANITYShaun says in one of the workouts, Its not INSANITY. What he means is that its harder than INSANITY. Since most of you are aware that INSANITY is very difficult, this may be a daunting statement.But that should not deter you. Beachbody offers several training programs that will get you ready. You dont necessarily even have to do INSANITY first. P90X, TurboFire, and even RevAbs will prepare you adequately. Trying THE ASYLUM off the couch is not recommended. You likely wouldnt make it through the warm-up.However, if you find yourself in this situation, dont fret. Heres a 4-week ASYLUM prep schedule thatll get you where you need to be.Because the workouts in THE ASYLUM series are more targeted, the load is more spread out. This allows you more recovery time between similar workouts. Yes, there will be moments in each workout where you cant imagine finishing, but the cumulative effect is easier on your body and youll recover faster than you think. Also, since most of the individual workouts are under 45 minutes, and both volumes of THE ASYLUM are only one-month training phases, theres always a light at the end of the tunnel to keep you going.What is the difference between ASYLUM Volume 1 and Volume 2?Volume 1Start here first. Volume 1 has 6 workouts, each of which train the body in a different way: Speed & Agility, Strength, Vertical Plyo, Back to Core, Relief, and Game Day. Theres also a bonus 10-minute workout called Overtime thats used to add a brutally hard finish to any workout.The workouts are aptly titled; they tell you how theyre going to exhaust you. Game Day is the culmination of your training and mimics playing a bunch of sports in one day, all condensed into an hour. For those of you who want more details, click on the links below to read my analysis of each individual workout.Workouts: Strength,Vertical, Back to Core, Relief, Overtime, Speed & Agility, and Game DayVolume 2Nailed Volume 1? Welcome to Volume 2! Part deux follows the same pattern, but ramps things up a notch. The workouts are a little longer and a little harder for the most part, but follow the same pattern.Whats so special about THE ASYLUM?There are two aspects of THE ASYLUM that make it unique. First and foremost, its fun. Any egghead can design a technically-advanced training system, but it takes a great trainer to make it entertaining. More than anything, ASYLUM workouts are a blast. Shaun T takes you through myriad movements in each workout that mimic playing sports. If you were ever an athlete, a lot of this training will seem familiar. But, unlike your old coach, hes combined these sports with movements based on the latest research in applied science. The results are workouts that are both scientifically sound and fun. But dont equate fun with easy. Workouts in THE ASYLUM will be a challenge, no matter who you are. Even Shaun himself struggles throughout the program. Elite fitness always must be earned.So its fun. But does it work?Absolutely. The second key aspect to ASYLUM is the science. The programs are based on something we call the Athletic Matrix. Essentially, its a system utilizing a wide spectrum of sports-specific training techniques that are modified to offer fitness and performance benefits beyond those sports.We coined the term because our harder programs are based on the same kind of structure used to train professional athletes. It can cover a range of techniques. For example, P90X is like training for a sport in that you isolate various functions (flexibility, individual muscle groups, cardiovascular conditioning, etc.) and focus on them separately using the different workouts. On the other hand, INSANITY is like playing the sport because you train everything at once.The P90X2/ASYLUM analogy is similar, but slightly more targeted. P90X2 is like off-season training. Its what you do when you have time to systematically break down your body and build it back up to be better than it was. THE ASYLUM, with its frenetic time-efficient structure, is more like footballs tradition of Hell Weekwhat you do to get ready when the season is about to start.With P90X and P90X2, you work across 90 daysa lengthy periodization structure where you work on specific elements of fitness, switching from one to another. In THE ASYLUM, we distill 90 days of training into a single month. This means youre training all of the physiological needs of an athlete at once. There are always some sacrifices when you do this. THE ASYLUM is less versatile than P90X2 and doesnt go as deep at training certain areas, but it does whip you into condition quicker.Both variations are ideal for athletic training, but the Athletic Matrix provides benefits far beyond the playing field. Youre building muscle, teaching the muscle how to move in all directions, and improving your cardiovascular system, flexibility, and power. Youll be stronger, run faster, jump higher, be more flexible, and basically move like you did when you were younger. This works to your advantage whether youre throwing a 45-yard pass, dancing at your 45th birthday party, or chasing four 5-year-olds around the room.Its game night at THE ASYLUM. You ready to play?"

Do Crash Diets Work?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/crash-diets-work,"Elvis Presley, the king of rock n roll, pelvic thrusts, and peanut butter and bacon sandwiches, was rumored to have once heavily sedated himself for 2 weeks in an attempt to continually sleep and lose weight. While he might have removed the bags from under his eyes, Elvis crash diet did nothing to help him cram into that jumpsuit, and he ended up gaining 10 pounds. As far back as the binge-and-purge bacchanalias of ancient Rome, people have been trying to lose weight in the fastest and sometimes strangest ways. With tactics ranging from subsisting on baby food to ingesting live tapeworms, crash diets promise quick and efficient weight loss, but at what price?What is a crash diet?A crash diet is any nutritional plan that severely reduces calories, is nutritionally restrictive, and is supposed to promote quick weight loss. Often the diet focuses on one food group or type, and is not usually intended for long-term use. Any diet that goes below 1,000 calories a day is considered extremely dangerous, and just one step away from starvation.What is the benefit?Do crash diets actually work? According to Dr. Susan Roberts, a professor of nutrition and psychiatry at Tufts University, crash diets are (at least temporarily) effective for disinhibited eaters, or those who are easily tempted by food. (Thats all of us, isnt it?) According to her study, by dropping weight quickly, those who are easily discouraged by slow and steady weight loss get instant gratification, and therefore, results. The problem, of course, is that you cant maintain a crash diet forever. Donald Hensrud, chairman of preventive medicine at Mayo Clinic, said: People could eat nothing but jelly beans and if they were eating just a small amount, they would lose weight. You might be able to get away with it for a period of time, but the more restrictive the diet isand the longer you follow itthe greater the risks.What are those risks?The first issue is usually nutrient deficiency, as one cannot get all of the nutrients he or she needs from a bowl of cabbage soup. It is difficult to get a sufficient amount of calcium, vitamin D, or iron on a very low-calorie diet. You can do permanent damage to your organs by not providing them with their required fuel. If you lose too much fluid, you can damage your electrolyte level, and become easily dehydrated. We know low levels of potassium and sodium can cause cramping, fainting, and even heart failure.The next thing youre looking at is a slower metabolism. Your body is an extremely efficient machine and will slow down its resting metabolic rate in order to survive longer. This is how our ancestors made it through famine, floods, and sometimes, just winter. Over time, you will lose lean muscle without the proper nutrients to maintain it, which will lower your metabolism even further. With that slower metabolism comes decreased energy. Not only will that affect your home and work life, it will destroy your workouts.Should you continue on the super low-cal path, you are likely to suffer catabolic reactions. You would expect to lose weight as long as your metabolism uses up more chemicals and energy than it is replacing, right? In fact, weight loss may occur for a short period resulting not from fat loss, but from breakdown of cell structures, organ tissue, bone, and muscle. The body then uses up structural proteins in order to survive. So, yes, your body will begin to consume itself.Your emotional state will usually alter with the lower number on the scale, which is not quite low enough to compensate for how yucky you feel. Irritability, depression, and lack of patience are very common with calorie restriction. Your sleep state will be affected, as severe caloric restriction often disrupts sleep patterns and can cause insomnia. Lack of sleep, in turn, will not assist in muscle recovery, your mood, or your energy. And eventually when you return to a rational eating plan, your body will be all the more likely to store everything you eat, as it thinks it has been starving for the last few weeks.Why, why, why?So, why on earth would anyone do this to themselves, especially if it means only drinking lemon juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper? The quick fix. We are a drive-thru nation that believes instant gratification is our birthright. If we can get it in a pill or hire someone to do it for us, we will. We also live in a culture obsessed with thinness, and we seldom take into consideration how much lean muscle can actually do for us, and how much better it looks than skinny fat. So we torture ourselves with the path of least resistance and end up right back where we started, often before that high school reunion or Christmas party actually happens. And we still cant fit into that darn dress.What is the answer?The answer is, as it has been for centuries, to make a decision to change your life, and then to have the motivation and discipline to stick with it. Eat a clean diet, somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 calories depending on your needs, split up over 5 to 6 meals a day with an appropriate balance of protein, carbs, and fats. Perform intense exercise that burns 500 to 800 calories a day, creating a greater caloric deficit, and speeding up your metabolism. Drink lots of water; get 8 hours of sleep; and try to avoid alcohol, refined sugar, and processed foods. Losing 1 to 2 pounds a week is not really hard to figure out, but it does take hard work and commitment to a plan.ConclusionCyril Connolly, the famous writer and critic, once said, The one way to get thin is to reestablish a purpose in life. And truly, that is the kind of commitment it takes. If weight loss were easy, everyone in the world would pop a pill, subsist on only bananas, and walk for just 30 minutes a day. If weight loss were easy, we would not be inundated with Jenny Craig commercials and weight loss-based reality shows. If weight loss were easy, all of those New Years resolutions would have come to fruition. But diets alone, especially the crash variety, do not work. So stay off the diet merry-go-round and stay committed to the control of your health and your appearance. Just because Elvis couldnt lose weight without extreme means doesnt mean you cant. Of course, you probably cant get paid thousands to wear a rhinestoned spandex jumpsuit, so it evens out."

10 Ways to Incorporate Dance into Your Exercise Routine
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/10-ways-incorporate-dance-exercise-routine,"Dance is arguably the most popular form of exercise in the world. We do it to celebrate, to mourn, to mate, to express ourselves, and, most importantly, to get on reality television. Not only is it one of those magic workouts that doesnt feel like a workout, but this successive group of rhythmical steps usually set to music is a major calorie burner. It stimulates coordination, stamina, and cardiovascular conditioning, and it builds muscles. The average 130-pound woman can burn more than 300 calories doing an hour of ballet. But if pink tights and pirouettes arent your thing, there are dance styles to meet every skill level and interest, from pole dancing to dangling from a piece of material attached to the ceiling. Which form is right for you? Lets look at some options.1. BalletBallet is considered the basis of most dance disciplines. It was first introduced in 1581 as a form of entertainment in the European courts and has evolved into the most strenuous of all performing arts. Ballet classes are usually divided into two parts, the first of which involves holding onto a bar that is attached to the wall. This is where you get a lot of the benefits of placement, core work, and muscle building. The rest of the class is usually completed in the center of the room, where you get the cardiovascular benefits as well as coordination and stamina. Should you be a bit timid about the class option, a program like Yoga Booty Ballet Ab & Butt Makeover can give you many of the same benefits without you having to leave your living room. Getting that toned and lithe ballerina body without having to remove your pajamas? Priceless.2. JazzJazz is a form of dance that is often difficult to define because so many styles fall under this category. The style seems to have emerged in the late 1800s, and until the 1950s, it included the cakewalk, the jitterbug, African-American vernacular dance, and the Charleston. With the emergence of Broadway, the now smooth style of jazz dance came into being. And still, there are endless types of jazz dance, all of which are amazing forms of exercise. Because jazz is fast-paced, high-energy movement, you will burn numerous calories, increase your flexibility and stamina, and shape your thighs and butt better than any ThighMaster will. Classes for people of all ages and skill levels can be found at studios, community centers, and universities.3. Tap danceWhile being incredibly intricate, tap dance seems to be one of the easiest forms of dance for an adult to learn. Tap is creating music with your feet, and anyone with a sense of rhythm and loose ankles can become proficient with enough practice. The downside of tap is that because it is so detailed, the smaller movements can mean that you burn fewer calories. Still, the ability to move like Gene Kelly can well compensate for the fact that you might still need your Turbo Jam workouts to shed the pounds.4. Hip HopHip hop dancing started in the early 1970s, with its roots in break dancing and popping and locking. As hip hop music evolved in the 1980s, so did the many styles of street dancing that we call hip hop today. Hip hop is fun, high energy, and often set to popular music. Hip hop also works your core, which is why a program like Hip Hop Abs can be so effective. Classes can be found all over the place, including gyms, dance studios, and even through park and recreation departments. Just think about how great you will look.5. Contemporary and ModernAlthough based in ballet, contemporary and modern dance styles were a direct rebellion against the rigid discipline and rules of ballet. Contemporary and modern dance are concerned with expression yet still require a degree of technical proficiency that often means years of practice. The focus of most forms of contemporary dance is the center, or your core, which means that you will easily work on and strengthen your stomach and back muscles. These forms of dance are readily found in the university system but can also be found at dance studios.6. Ballroom and LatinBallroom and Latin dance styles have been around for as long as people have danced in Europe and South America, but theyve become widely popular in the U.S. in the last century, thanks to Fred Astaire, Arthur Murray, and Dancing with the Stars. Ballroom dance styles are particularly enjoyable as they are done with a partner, and you only need a few hours to learn some of the most basic steps. Because of its low-impact nature, ballroom dancing is appropriate for all age groups, does not require extreme flexibility, and can range from a slow waltz to a boppin Texas two-step to a fast West Coast swing. Whats more, while youre shedding pounds, youre preparing for your cousins wedding, your class reunion, and possibly an inauguration ball. Talk about motivation.7. AlternativeAlternative dance styles, or PG-13 classes, include pole dancing, stripteasing, and burlesque dancing. As these new expressions of movement become more mainstream, everyone from the sorority girl to the grandmother is giving them a shot. Besides the obvious advantage to learning these dance styles, the upper-body strength required for dancing on a pole is rather amazing. Whats more is that these adult dance styles not only move you toward having a fitter body, but even before getting that fitter body, many women gain self-confidence.8. TissueTissue dancing is a form of aerial acrobatics that is often seen in circus-style shows like Cirque du Soleil. Remember 10th-grade gym class and climbing the rope? Now imagine wrapping yourself up in the rope, hanging upside down like a bat, and quickly unraveling yourself until you almost hit the floor. This, and hundreds of other tricks, is done with a very strong piece of material hung from the ceiling and very daring participants who are willing to be sore for many days following the class. There is a huge emphasis on upper-body strength, flexibility, and the core in tissue dancing. Classes are readily available in most metropolitan cities, and workshops are offered through many companies that travel nationwide.9. BellyBelly dancing, or Middle Eastern-style dancing, can be traced back to the 12th century, but its exact origin is a giant controversy. Some believe it has religious origins, others think that it was a part of childbirth, and still more fight over it whether it originated in Egypt, Africa, or Greece. In the Middle East, its taught to both boys and girls very casually, and its become increasingly popular in the U.S. in the last 20 years. Belly dancing requires great control of the stomach muscles and the ability to move different parts of the body while isolating and holding others still. As a quick note, belly dancing tends to favor curves, so if youre a woman who prefers to bask in the glory of her natural lines, this is the perfect art form for you.10. FolkEach culture has held on to a piece of its history by imparting the dances of its ancestors to its young. Just as each cultural dance is completely different, so is the amount of calories you might expend or the different muscle groups that might get stimulated. For instance, Irish stepping or Bollywood dancing might be the equivalent of running 5 miles, while Japanese fan dancing might be more akin to doing laundry. Regardless, if the style of dance is meaningful to you, and you are exercising, the fact that you are moving is the most important thing! Find the type of folk dance that interests you and also the kind of music that you enjoy. I spent an afternoon at a Highland dance competition, and after 7 hours of bagpipe music, I was ready to remove my ears.There is a world of dance options out there that can be fun and also help create the body of your dreams. As with all new forms of exercise, do the research and find a qualified instructor, class, or video series before you begin your journey. And if the class option is not for you, go find a dance floor in a local bar or blast the stereo in your living room, and just start dancing. Because if you think you can dance, really, you can."

Eat Your Way to Great Abs with These 7 Tips
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/eat-way-great-abs-7-tips,"When it comes to creating incredible abs, even the most effective workout programs can only bring you so far. Thats because you cant get a flat, hard midsection without losing body fat. No matter how much effort you put into creating a six-pack, no ones going to see it if its covered by a layer of flab.If youre following the dietary guidelines of a Beachbody fitness program, youll automatically be eating the right foods to lose fat as you get in shape. But the following seven principles can give you an extra edge, and will help ensure that the effort youre putting into your abs will bring you the results you want.1. Get plenty of proteinEating enough lean protein promotes fat loss and muscle gain, the two most important elements for developing great abs. It also helps keep you from getting hungry while youre eating right. You dont have to gobble down 12-ounce steaksjust eat a normal portion of lean meat, fish, low-fat dairy, or vegetarian protein with every meal, and make sure your snacks contain some protein, too. If you still have a hard time getting enough in your diet, a daily Shakeology shake can be a perfect addition.By the way, protein is especially important in the morning, when a lot of people dont get as much as they should. A protein-rich breakfast will help keep your blood sugar steady for hours, preventing the dips that can lead to cravings later in the day. (Try some low-fat chicken sausage, or an omelet with one whole egg and three egg whites, along with fruit or whole-grain toast.)2.Reconsider your carbs.Despite the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, the average American meal is still too high in sugar and fast-burning starches to bring body fat down to ab-baring levels. Its time to say goodbye to sweetened soda, ditch the Doritos, and save the cake for your birthday. If your fitness plan calls for a sports drink before a long cardio workout, or a carb-and-protein recovery drink after resistance training, thats fine. But the rest of the time, stick with foods that are on the low end of the glycemic index (refer to GlycemicIndex.com for more information)these foods burn more slowly, so they wont spike your blood sugar and insulin levels.3. Have fun with fiber.Something about the word fiber just doesnt sound appetizing. But high-fiber foods can actually be quite delicious: fresh berries and other fruits, salads loaded with colorful produce, your favorite steamed vegetables or vegetable soup, stews or chili made with beans, chewy whole-grain breads and cerealsYou get the picture. (These foods just happen to be loaded with nutrients as well.) High-fiber foods keep you fuller with fewer calories, and they help keep your digestive system working at its besta double-whammy for getting rid of belly bulge.4. Enjoy some yogurt.Probiotics, the healthful bacteria found in yogurt and other fermented foods, have been proven to help reduce belly fat. In a recent study in Finland, new mothers who took probiotic supplements averaged smaller waist circumferencesand lower body fat in generalthan those who didnt take probiotic supplements. And while the topic is still controversial, studies have found that eating lots of calcium-rich dairy foods like yogurt may increase overall weight loss.5. Dont forget to eat.Tempted to lower your daily calorie count by skipping meals? Dont. Going hungry can raise your levels of the stress-related hormone cortisol, which research has found can increase belly fat even in otherwise thin women. And eating too infrequently can lower your metabolism and energy levels, while increasing the chance that youll get too hungry and decide to chuck your meal plan entirely. If youre eating the right foods, regular meals and snacks will keep your body fueled while youre working toward that strong core.6. Drink more fluids. Hydration is important when youre on a fitness plan, but drinking plenty of water has particular benefits for your midsection. It helps keep your stomach full, so you dont overeat, and it helps flush out excess sodium to prevent belly bloating. (Eating more potassium-rich foods, such as tomatoes and bananas, will also help in this area.) Plain ol H20 cant be beat, but you can also switch it up with flavored waters, iced tea, and anything else you like to drink that isnt full of sweeteners. How much do you need? The old rule of 8 glasses a day is a good start, but everyone is different: drink more if youre exercising or its hot out, and drink less if youre running to the bathroom every 5 minutes.7. With one exception.Its time to cut down on the hooch. The proverbial beer belly isnt just the result of extra caloriesalcohol actually makes it more difficult for your body to metabolize carbs and fat. Booze also stimulates your appetite and lowers your inhibitions, which can lead to bingeing. The best road to flat abs is no alcohol at all, but if you really like a drink now and then, just have one at a time (and no more than a few a week), and stay away from higher-calorie beers and sugary mixed drinks.If you add these rules to your fitness plan, youre sure to see faster improvements in your midsection. Of course, theres an added bonus to eating this way: itll keep you healthier, too. That may not be as big an inducement as great abs, but were throwing it in for free."

What You May Not Know About Postpartum Depression
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/what-you-may-not-know-about-postpartum-depression,"Its not surprising that many new moms find themselves in a funk right after having a baby. Hormones are out of whack, sleep is a distant memory, and your entire life has been turned upside down by an adorable little squish, who is (no pressure!) totally dependent on you for everything.So, yeah, a mild case of the baby blues is both normal and understandable.But for many women, the funk doesnt go away after those first few weeks. According to the American Psychological Association, as many as 16 percent of women experience postpartum depression, a more prolonged and severe illness.Postpartum depression and the baby blues share many symptoms, including mood swings, crying jags, sadness, insomnia, and irritability, says Dr. Michelle Golland, a clinical psychologist in Hollywood, CA. But while the baby blues only last a few weeks, PPD symptoms stick around longer, andsymptoms can be more severe, including finding difficulty in caring for your newborn and suicidal thoughts.Many people think of postpartum depression as something that only strikes during the first few months of mommyhood. New moms are typically screened for postpartum depression after the birth and again at their post-baby checkup.But PPD can actually strike anytime within the first postpartum year. Researchers at Olmsted Medical Center recently discovered that when follow-up screenings were given at the six-month and one-year marks, there was a significant increase in the number of PPD cases. This may not be late-onset PPD. It may be the emergence of symptoms that have been lingering under the surface,  says Karen Kleiman, MSW, LCSW, founder of The Postpartum Stress Center and author ofTherapy and the Postpartum Woman.How can postpartum depression go unnoticed for so long?For starters, the symptoms of depression mirror the symptoms ofwellhaving a newborn in the house. Youre stressed, youre exhausted, you see your friends less, and you find yourself weeping at home makeover shows. (Erso Ive heard.)Kleiman says moms, may confuse their symptoms for normal postpartum experiences and not be able to tell the difference between being tired and being unable to function well.At that first post-baby checkup, none of those things might seem worth mentioning. But screen again at six months, and a woman may think: Hey, this has been going on for a while now, and it doesnt feel normal.Even if a new mom does suspect somethings wrong, she may put off reporting her symptoms due to the stigma surrounding mental illnessespecially since societal expectations tell her shes expected to be bursting with baby bliss. They may be getting messages from their support network to be strong or power through, Kleiman says. They may feel if they tell anyone what they are really thinking, someone will think they are crazyor worse, take their baby away from them.The recent research indicates that additional screenings could play a key role in helping to identify more women who may be at risk, so theyre able to get the treatment they need. Postpartum women should be screened repeatedly, Kleiman says. A low screen score does not necessarily mean she is out of the woods. A woman is most at risk for emotional illness during and after pregnancy than at any other time in her life. She should be monitored closely during these times.Until these additional screenings become the norm, its important to tune in to your own emotionsand listen to concerned friends who may be able to recognize your symptoms before you can. There is no shame in seeking help.Please remember that self-care is not selfish and that your baby needs you to be emotionally well, says Dr. Golland, who struggled with PPD herself as a new mom. Give yourself breaks when needed: baths, time with friends, and whatever else your brain and body need to feel solid and grounded. Its also critical that you get enough sleep; being sleep-deprived can have a snowball effect for new moms leading to PPD. Talk about how youre feeling and the symptoms youre struggling to manage. I would also encourage fathers and other family members to know the warning signs of PPD and to intervene when needed."

Can Exercise Help Relieve Depression?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/can-exercise-help-relieve-depression,"Throughout his life, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffered from depression, a disease he described as the Black Dog. Having wrestled with it myself since childhood, I can say with some authority that theres no more apt description. Although its presence has lessened over the years as Ive done the work, there are still mornings when I awake to find my own, private Black Dog waiting for me at the foot of the bed, its mournful stare setting the tone for the entire day. In my youth, it would follow me for weeks or months, becoming bigger and more menacing the more I tried to ignore it. Today, I have fixes that shorten its stay.Im one of those fortunate depressives who can find solutions without pharmaceuticalsalthough it takes effort. So when the Black Dog visits, after Ive dealt with my usual daily tasks like watering and feeding my charges, feeding and watering myself, and sending a few work emails so that I appear productive (all challenging tasks on a bad day), I slide into my cycling kit, clip on my shoes and helmet, hop on my bike, and head out on the road for some therapy.Although anyone whos ever gone for a walk to clear their head already knows this, the notion that exercise fights depression is fairly well established. A review of 25 studies in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine unveiled strong evidence of its preventative benefits, even if that exercise is just light cardio a few hours each week. Does that make it a great way to shake the occasional blahs? You bet! Will it cure you if you have a major issue? Probably not. Exercise doesnt necessarily solve the whole problem, says Sport & Exercise Psychologist Dr. Haley Perlus, but it alleviates a lot of the day-to-day symptoms.And, as anyone whos ever dealt with depression knows, alleviating those day-to-day symptoms the Black Dog presents can be incredibly powerful, so exercise should surely be one of the primary tools in your psychological toolbox.What is Depression?There are many shades of depression, but its best defined by the Mayo Clinic as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. There are a number of possible causes, including brain chemistry, hormone imbalances, genetics, and life trauma. It can range from temporary melancholy to lifelong clinical depression. Triggers are also varied. Major events such as death of a loved one or divorce may cause it. Many mothers experience postpartum depression. Some people experience Seasonal Affective Disorder, meaning theyre actually impacted by a lack of sunlight. Othersas is my casesimply wake up some mornings feeling rotten without being 100% certain why (although I can usually dig up the root cause with a good meditation session).One tricky aspect of depression is that people whove never experienced it have a hard time sympathizing. Its not like diabetes or a heart condition, with easily comprehensible pathology. You dont just snap out of a depression and you should never write off a friend or family members depression as something thatll just pass. Speaking firsthand, theres a lot of ugly stuff floating around in your gray matter when youre having an episodeincluding thoughts that can lead to choices seemingly illogical to the outside observer. Case in point, the recentand very tragicdeath of comedian Robin Williams.So, its important to address the issue head-on, typically with therapy, medication, or some combination thereof. There are also a number of practices that can help, including meditation, journaling, self-help books, and the focus of this article: exercise.How Does Exercise Help?Exercise makes you feel good. Yes, it can also make you feel sore and exhaustedbut in a good way, on many different levels.For one, it has a direct, chemical impact on your brain. How this happens isnt 100% understood, but in his book Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, Dr. John Ratey does a great job at fleshing out the various hypotheses, which all seem to center around the way exercise impacts your brain in much the same ways antidepressants do.The first theory is that both boost endorphins, the morphine-like hormones responsible, at their most extreme, for the runners high.Another theory looks at neurotransmitters, chemicals in your brain responsible for ushering various specific signals to where they need to go. For example, norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that helps you focus in stressful situations, including exercise. With it, you make smarter choices. Another neurotransmitter, dopamine, motivates you and improves your mood in general. When you exercise, it pushes you to work harder. Serotonin is also released when you exercise, but it has the opposite influence. It improves mood like dopamine, but it mellows you out, counteracting the various stress hormones activated by exercise and helping you wind down after a workout.These neurotransmitters are boosted in various degrees by various antidepressant medications. Theyre also boosted by exercise.Both antidepressants and exercise also increase a substance called brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which protects the brain against the damaging effects of the stress hormone cortisol. It also helps the brain stay strong in general. As Ratey puts it, it serves as a fertilizer that encourages neurons to connect to one another and grow. Its been found to be low in depressed patients.Beyond your cranial chemistry, exercise also helps you feel good about yourself from a psychological standpoint. Working your body is a choice you make to better yourself, so doing it makes you feel better about yourself. Its a process that Dr. Perlus refers to as coping self-esteem, a way of proving to yourself that you have at least some control over your life. If I go outside for a walk, or put on a DVD and do ten minutes of core work, thats a choice I made to help myself and I got through it, and that increases my coping self-esteem, she explains, and thats as important as all the serotonin, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters Ive released.But theres a catch. For exercise to work like this, it needs to be something you actually dig. It needs to be something you choose, that brings you joy otherwise it wont help from a depression standpoint, Perlus adds. This is yet another reason why when people ask me which Beachbody program will give them the best results, I tell them to pick the one that looks the most fun.Does Exercise Replace Antidepressants and Therapy?If youre temporarily down in the dumps, exercise alone might do the trick. If youre having a depressed mood because something negative happened in the day, but you generally have a positive outlook on life, then exercise would be my primary recommendation, says Dr. Perlus.But if its a persistent or intense depression, the answer is no. Depression is a serious medical issue and, like all medical issues, your best path is to seek professional help. Explains Perlus: When were talking about clinical depression, while exercise is an important tool for relieving depression, you need to balance it out with all the other tools. Some people do need to be medicated. Im a high advocate of talk therapy.Dr. Perlus isnt alone in recommending exercise be part of your healing strategy. Its become a common prescription for depression in Europe and in 2013, the Journal of Psychiatric Practice laid out information for doctors wishing to include prescriptive exercise in their recommendation. The guidelines call for exercise 35 times a week (more wouldnt hurt) for 4560 minutes. 1012 weeks of this are needed for maximum anti-depressive effect. Although this is a good starting place, other recommendations vary. Also keep in mind that research shows inactivity to increase the occurrence of depression. In other words, it doesnt matter which exercise you do to beat the blues. But, by all means, get off your butt and do it.I fought depression for years on my own. It wasnt until my mid-twenties, when I embraced therapy and discovered my passion for outdoor sports, that solutions presented themselves. After years of work, Ive reached a point where exercise and meditation are my primary sources of depression management.Today, I know that when the Black Dog randomly visitsor if life issues a blow that knocks me to my kneesgetting on that bike is key. (Sometimes its the surfboard, kayak, or yoga mat, but you get the idea.) Rolling for miles and miles on an open road, feeling my legs burn as I strain up hills, racing fellow cyclists to the nearest stop sign, these things dont solve my problems, but they put my brain in a place where I can cope with the issues. When I come home, sweaty, exhausted, hungry, and (sometimes) smiling, the Black Dog might not be gone, but hes no longer a threat. I now have the strength to simply acknowledge him and go about my dayand thats the best way to make him go away."

Active Maternity First Trimester Workout with Autumn Calabrese
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/active-maternity-first-trimester-workout-with-autumn-calabrese,"Are you a mom to be? If youre looking to stay fit during your pregnancy, make sure to check out the brand-new prenatal workouts designed by Autumn Calabrese, mom and creator of the 21 Day Fix. Before you begin any of these workouts, make sure to check with your doctor and be cleared to exercise.The series of four workouts (so far) includes three prenatal workouts (one for each trimester) and one postnatal workout. The workout designed for the first trimester focuses on building a solid foundation through a series of eight movements. It will help you tone muscle, increase circulation and endurance, and get your body ready to bring your baby into the world.The weighted movements engage your lower body, upper body, and core. If the weights become too heavy, simply put them aside and do the moves without them. Some of these moves test your balance, but dont be concerned if you feel like its all over the place. Autumn explains that this may happen as your body is rapidly changing. But, as your baby grows and as you progress with these workouts, you should begin to gain a better awareness of your body and get better at balancing.Watch the video below for a glimpse at the workout. Once youre through the first trimester, continue to follow along with the rest of the Active Maternity series.

Lifting For Two: Nicole Moneer's Full-Body Pregnancy Workout
The weights don't always have to go back on the rack when you find out you're pregnant. Here's how Bodybuilding.com athlete Nicole Moneer modified her workouts and kept training into the third trimester!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lifting-for-two-nicole-moneer-full-body-pregnancy-workout.html,"The difference between the first trimester in a pregnancy and the second and third is, to say the least, dramatic. As I detailed in my ""Guide to a Fit First Trimester,"" you experience a lot of mysterious and powerful feelings for those initial 12 weeksthirst, sleepiness, nausea, and bizarre cravings in my casebut you don't necessarily feel like you've got a living, wriggling person growing inside you. But then, at some point, that baby announces his or her presence with authority!This is when you start to feel really pregnantespecially in a physical sense. How women respond to this change varies incredibly from person to person. A number of people were shocked to see I was still lifting weights halfway through my pregnancy. I had to remind them that every woman is unique, just like every pregnancy is unique.My hope is that I can help you get the most benefit out of whatever training you can manage during the second and third trimesters of your pregnancy. To be clear, not all women feel like they can work out during this time, and in some cases, it's medically necessary for them not to. So check in frequently with your health care provider.But if you're up for it, join me as I show the modifications that allowed me to keep training all the way through my pregnancy!Nicole Moneer's Full-Body Pregnancy Workout Watch the video - 13:01 Nicole Moneer's Full-Body Pregnancy Workout Squat variations triset1Hip-width squat3 sets of 10-15 reps  Sumo squat3 sets of 10-15 reps  Split-stance lunge squat3 sets of 10-15 reps  2Thigh adductor3 double dropsets of 10 reps (don't take any sets to failure)  3Thigh abductor3 double dropsets of 10 reps (don't take any sets to failure)  4Seated cable rear-delt fly (chest expansion)3 sets of 10-15 reps  Note: Performed seated on exercise ball.5Knee push-up8-10 per side  6Seated dumbbell shoulder press3 sets of 10-15 reps  Superset7Seated biceps curl3 sets of 10-15 reps  Seated overhead triceps extension3 sets of 10-15 reps  Note: Rest 1-2 minutes between sets, or as needed. NotesKeep moving, keep active, and don't overdo it.Focus on opening up posture with arm exercises.Be confident, but reasonable. Every woman comes into pregnancy from a different place, and has different challenges to overcome and choices to make.Rest! A huge part of taking care of yourself and your child isn't working outit's resting.How to Hold On to FitnessDuring the second trimester, making customizations and listening to my body became far more important than it had seemed during the first trimester. If I felt the muscles in my abdomen stretching, I immediately switched to a seated exercise, decreased the weight, or stopped the exercise altogether. If something didn't feel good, I changed it up or didn't do it.You must take care, because reckless movements can lead to bleeding or tightening of the uterus or stomach, among other complications. If you are not a veteran lifter, hire a professional to teach you training adjustments. I accepted that many of my former ""normal"" activities would need modification, and I would probably experience greater muscle soreness.You must take care, because reckless movements can lead to bleeding or tightening of the uterus or stomach, among other complications.Here are some of the major adjustments I made:I kept teaching cardio-kickboxing classes, but I took needed breaks and kept the class moving even when I wasn't.I made the switch to push-ups from the knees. Before, I repped single-arm push-ups!I took Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off from the gym. I eventually worked down to two workouts per week, and that was plenty!I cut my cardio way back. Trust me, once you get past Week 30, just getting around is enough of a battle!No more crunches. I did a modified plank for a while, but eventually, core work ceased to really be feasible or advisable.As a special reward for all of this workand because it just felt greatI got deep-tissue pregnancy massages once a week, with special focus on my TFL [tensor fasciae latae], IT, sartorius, and glutes. I highly recommend this, but make sure your practitioner is trained in pregnancy massage specifically! I would always feel great after my massage, but the next day I was usually tight again from sleeping on my side.Keep on SquattingSquatting isn't just the best lift in weight training; it is also one of 12 natural positions for birth. I wasn't sure if I was going to give birth squatting, but I definitely kept doing squats throughout my pregnancy. This is one of my major messages to pregnant women: Just because you can't do what you used to doesn't mean you can't do anything! We can all benefit from using our muscles in some way.In the second half of my pregnancy, I was doing sets of 12 of unweighted Smith machine squats.It's the reverse of normal lifting, where you exercise, get progressively stronger, and increase the challenge. I lowered the weight, did more reps, and once I couldn't do a lift anymore, I just let it go.Just because you can't do what you used to doesn't mean you can't do anything! We can all benefit from using our muscles in some way.Even with just a few weeks to go, squats felt so good to do. I did multiple variations: sumo, hip-width, and sometimes narrow to strengthen all the muscles around my hips. I also did a lot of lunges. I knew I'd benefit from having a strong and flexible lower body, both during my birth and in those crucial post-partum recovery weeks.In the third trimester I felt the weight pulling as I carried dumbbells, so I carried them by my shoulders. For this reason, I also began relying on the Smith machine. It was safer with the weight, giving me stability and balance so there was little chance of me falling. If you are at home, squat into a chair, sit up, and stand up. Dial things back however you need.Some Numbers Go Down, Others Go UpYeah, about the weight: I allowed myself to gain 20 pounds through 30 weeks without freaking out the slightest bit. Moms need to have a healthy weight to have a healthy baby weight, and the amount that women gain can be widely variable. If you were underweight to begin with, you actually might gain more. It's not unheard of for women to gain 40 or even 50 pounds over the course of a pregnancy, and that's OK.With those crazy first-trimester cravings out of the way, I put my focus on eating quality food and didn't worry about counting calories precisely. I ate lots of protein, vegetables, and healthy fatssound familiar?Supplement-wise, I kept taking my whole food-based prenatal, and since I avoid store-bought dairy, I got extra calcium from leafy greens and supplements. I also started drinking Rejuvalec, a fermented wheatberry drink high in vitamin B, which I felt helped with nausea, my energy levels, and clear skin.  Sleep Get it When and How You CanSure, working out when you're pregnant is hard. But it's not nearly as hard as sleeping. Getting quality rest was the ultimate challenge!Unfortunately, sleeping doesn't get any less important as your pregnancy progresses. In fact, it becomes more precious, especially because you know some seriously sleepless nights are right around the corner once that baby is born.It got to the point where I sometimes needed a hand getting up and getting out of bed. In time, even the simple act of lying on my side became difficult because of all that weight. I slept on my back a lot, but propped upright with pillows. Sitting up helped me sleep slightly better. If I slept on either hip, my muscles would tighten up.My recommendation: Get pillows and a Snoogle. A Snoogle is a pregnancy pillow that helps prop up your legs so you can sleep in the fetal position. I hated sleeping on my side until I got one. If this doesn't work for you, well, keep looking until you find what does!Finding the Perfect LineupThe day I became pregnant, I became part of a clubthe mommy club. I heard all the storiesthe good and the bad, the danger and the joy. I saw that labor and delivery, while scary and overwhelming in many ways, could also be wonderful!I knew I wanted a healthy, natural delivery. I wanted to avoid medical intervention. I wanted a midwife, rather than a doctor. I had a vision and a plan, but also recognized that anything could happen the day of the birth. Still, I planned ahead to have the right team with me: my midwife, my doula, my partner, and my mom's best friendshe was there in my late mother's absence. I know other women who only wanted their partner there with them. That's their team, and it's fine, too. What's important is that you make full use of yours.It's like what do we do at Bodybuilding.com. We surround ourselves with like-minded people who share our goals, people who have overcome challenges and can help us do the same. I took that mentality with my pregnancy and birthing: teamwork, community, support. As the day got closer, I took great comfort in knowing who would be at my side.Fitness can teach you a lot about pregnancy, and vice versa. Set your own goals, then open yourself to others' remarkable stories and use that to keep your mindset positive. Then fearlessly transform your life!"

You have a wonderful new little person in your life who depends on you for everything. This is a magical, important time for both of you, and things like exercise and nutrition are probably far from your mindas they should be.It's important not to rush things. The journey to pregnancy is long, and it can be just as long a journey to get back to your prebaby body. But that doesn't mean you have to sit still. On the contrary, you need to keep moving!Months 1-3 Overview Watch The Video - 09:31In this video and article, I go over everything you can do in the weeks following your delivery to get prepared for when you're ready to begin my Jamie Eason's Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer. I include things you can do in the early days, such as walking, and some simple core and fitness routines for after you get the ""green light"" from your doctor.The Early DaysLet's be realistic. Despite your best intentions for getting back into pre-pregnancy shape, your baby, your bodyand of course, your doctorwill be calling the shots for a while. So while you're adjusting to your new life, keep your focus where it matters most: on you and your baby.It may not feel like it right now, but this time goes by fast, and you don't want to miss anything. You'll be better prepared for the training that's just around the corner if you embrace a healthy approach and set small, achievable goals now. Plus, you'll be less likely to feel discouraged once you're ready to begin working out.While you're adjusting to your new life, keep your focus where it matters most: on you and your baby.For the first few weeks after pregnancy, your primary goal can be as simple as going for a short daily walk. As your doctor will tell you, walking is important to get your blood flowing, prevent blood clots in your lower extremities, and help improve your bladder and bowel function. It's also great for your mental health. So get out the stroller and let's go outside!Once you're up to it, I recommend that you squeeze in walks whenever possible, even if they're just a few minutes long. Try to walk with your baby in a stroller for about 20 minutes a day, but don't worry about measuring it closely. If you need to rest or go home after just a few minutes, that's fine. If you feel good enough to walk more than 20 minutes, great, but don't push yourself.Listen to your body, and rest when it tells you to rest. When you transition to my Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer, you'll be turning up the intensity soon enough.The ""Green Light""Most doctors will give mothers the green light to work out at around 4-6 weeks after a vaginal delivery, and 6-8 weeks after a cesarean birthalthough this may be different in your case. That's why it's crucial that you talk to your doctor and make sure you're OK to start doing more than just your daily walks.Personally, I recommend not starting a full fitness program with strength training and cardio until your baby is sleeping through the night. This might take as long as three months or more. Why is this so important? For you to really benefit from a strength-training fitness routine, you need to be getting more than just a few minutes of rest here and there. You need real recovery, and that means sleep! Plus, by this time, most breastfeeding mothers will have established a consistent milk supply and something resembling a feeding schedule.PlankWhat Do I Do Until Then?Fortunately, there's a lot you can do before that three-month markor wherever it happens to fall for you. Once you have your doctor's permission, you can start doing some simple workouts focusing on your abdominals and your back, in addition to your walking routine. Both of these muscle groups will be considerably weakened by everything you've gone through, but you'll be using them a lot as you lift and move about with the baby.Important note: Be sure to check for diastasis recti (abdominal wall separation) before engaging in any abdominal wall exercise. This video details how to perform a self-check. If you have diastasis, ask your doctor about the therapeutic options available before you start working out.Diastasis Recti  Watch The Video - 01:32I've also created a complete plan for the period after you've gotten permission to begin exercising and you're ready to begin the full training plan detailed in the Training Overview video. For now, you'll be doing short core and back-focused workouts 3-4 times a week along with your normal walking. Do these preparatory workouts until your doctor clears you to increase exercise. Then start Week 1 of my actual Post-Pregnancy Trainer.PREPARATORY WORKOUTS: WEEK 1Monday: WalkingTuesday: Core CircuitWednesday: WalkingThursday: Core CircuitFriday: WalkingSaturday: Core CircuitSunday: WalkingPREPARATORY WORKOUTS: WEEK 2Monday: Core CircuitTuesday: WalkingWednesday: Walking/Core CircuitThursday: WalkingFriday: Walking/Core CircuitSaturday: WalkingSunday: Core CircuitPREPARATORY WORKOUTS: WEEK 3Monday: Walking/Core CircuitTuesday: WalkingWednesday: Walking/Core CircuitThursday: WalkingFriday: Walking/Core CircuitSaturday: WalkingSunday: Core CircuitBut this is important: Only proceed to the next week's workout if this week's workouts were manageable and comfortable. Go at your own pace. I want you to feel like you're getting stronger and making progress.The Journey Has BegunMy hope is that this information will help you figure out where to start to get your body back on track. Slowly begin implementing these practices into your daily routine. I also recommend sharing this plan with your physician, since every woman's recovery is as unique as her pregnancy and delivery.Before starting any exercise, be sure to also watch the Nutrition Overview, Time Management Overview, Supplementation Overview, and Training Overview videos to get all the details about how to keep moving through this plan and getting back to your prebaby body.Week 1: Core Circuit Warm-up1Abdominal Isometric Hold (shown standing)8-10 sets of 10 second holds  Exercise Note: Lying on your back, pull your belly button into your lower back and hold for 10 seconds.2Superman8-10 sets of 10 second holds  Exercise Note: Lie flat on your stomach with your arms extended in front of you.

If you haven't watched the Months 1-3 video and looked at that program, do so before watching this video.For the last couple of weeks of that program, you'll work on your core and back strength, and increase the intensity of your daily walks. Once you're feeling comfortable with those circuits, and if you and your doctor think you're ready, it's time to take it up a notch and begin the circuit training program I created specifically for new moms.It's no coincidence that the Months 1-3 plan, this 12-week plan, and my 12-week LiveFit plan add up to roughly nine months total. That's how long you were pregnant, and my hope is that this three-pronged approach is exactly what you need to recapture your pre-pregnancy physiqueor maybe even your best physique ever. How does that sound?In this video and article, I'll give you an introduction to circuit training, outline the plan you'll be following for the next 12 weeks, and answer some of the questions you may have along the way.Training Overview Watch The Video - 12:42Am I ready for this?Jamie's Nine-Month PlanMonths 1-3: Post-pregnancy circuits Months 4-6: Post-pregnancy fitness trainer Months 7-9: LiveFitIf you've been feeling good and getting stronger, you're likely ready for the next stage of training. But if you're having any lingering pain, or if something simply doesn't feel right, be sure to talk to your doctor before you move on. If you have any symptoms of diastasis recti (abdominal wall separation), you may need more time before starting this section of the program. You can see a video about how to check for diastasis recti in the ""Months 1-3"" page.Of course, I understand that being ready means more than being physically prepared. You're probably still settling into life with your little one, and it can be daunting to think about finding any ""me time"" in your day for working out. The Time Management Overview can help with that to some degree, but missed days are bound to happen, especially in the first phase of the program.Don't sweat it. When this happens, simply start where you left off and keep going. Remember, this is a journey, not a daytrip. The important part is not to give up. This circuit-training program is meant to work with your busy schedule. Morning, noon, or night, fit it in where you can.What is circuit training?Circuit training is a style of training where you perform multiple exercises in a series. Your goal is to complete each exercise with little to no rest in between them, like you're doing one big, giant set. Then you rest and perform either another round or two of the same circuit, or a different circuit of exercises.Circuits are perfect for new moms because they work a lot of muscles in a short amount of time and can be customized for specific goals. Over the coming months, you'll perform circuits that build strength, add muscle mass, increase endurance, and strengthen your core muscles. Routines like my Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute Workoutwhich you'll find within the programare perfect for when you have a short window of time, want to get your heart rate up, and burn some calories.Circuits are perfect for new moms because they work a lot of muscles in a short amount of time and can be customized for specific goals.Another great thing about circuits? You can do them with weights like dumbbells or a medicine ball, or simply using your own body weight. So even if you don't have access to a gym right now, you can still make this plan work in less than half an hour per day. This type of routine is perfect if you can take advantage of your baby's naptime to do your training at home.For the first month of this program, you're going to use only your body weight. I found that with the right combination of exercises, this gave me all the challenge I needed. But if you feel like you want more intensity, feel free to add a medicine ball to some of the exercises.Phase 1 Weeks 1-4For the next eight weeks, you're going to train six days per week, with one well-deserved rest day every Sunday. During the first four weeks, which comprise Phase 1 of the program, you'll be alternating two circuits of bodyweight movements with two core-focused circuits. This arrangement makes it very easy to get back on track if you miss a day.Here's how it looks:WEEK 1-WEEK 3Monday: Napping baby circuitTuesday: Ab circuitWednesday: Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute WorkoutThursday: Swiss ball circuitFriday: Napping baby circuitSaturday: Stroller/carrier workoutSunday: RestWEEK 2-WEEK 4Monday: Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute WorkoutTuesday: Ab circuitWednesday: Napping baby circuitThursday: Swiss ball circuitFriday: Anytime, Anywhere, 15-Minute WorkoutSaturday: Stroller/carrier workoutSunday: RestOnce you're done with the first two weeks, you'll repeat: Week 3 will follow the exact same schedule as Week 1, and Week 4 will look like Week 2.You may have noticed that Saturdays are special during this month. I encourage you to get outside and spend time with your new baby. For this, I've designed two workouts you can do on a walk!The first is a stroller workout you can do on pretty much any street or in any park. You'll do things like bodyweight squats, lunges, and side leg raises while you're pushing the stroller, and step-ups, dips, and push-ups while it's parked.The second option is a workout you can do while your baby is strapped to you in a sling or a carrier. Choose one of these two workouts on Saturday while you're spending time with your baby. It should take no more than 15-20 minutes. Then, on Sunday, you'll rest up for the week to come.I encourage you to get outside and spend time with your new baby.Phase 2 Weeks 5-8After four weeks of alternating these bodyweight circuits, you'll be ready to step up your training and incorporate free weights. In this four-week phase, you'll perform routines I designed and followed myself to begin increasing both strength and muscle mass. This is when you'll really start to feeland possibly seethe gains you've been working for. Your baby is probably sleeping better by now, which means you're likely sleeping better too, and proper rest is really important for reaching your training goals.Just like in Phase One, you'll be training six days per week. But this time around, your week will be split into three strength workouts using a combination of weights and body weight, and three cardio workouts. Also unlike Phase One, each week in Phase Two will look the same:Phase twoMonday: Lower-body strength workoutTuesday: CardioWednesday: Upper-body strength workoutThursday: CardioFriday: Full-body strength workoutSaturday: CardioSunday: RestFor your cardio workouts, you can perform either the nap circuit or the 15-minute workout from Phase One, or if you prefer, 30 minutes of cardio training of your choice. If you're at home, consider running or jumping rope. If you have access to a pool, even swimming laps at a good pace can really get your heart rate up, so consider that as well.Your week will be split into three strength workouts using a combination of weights and body weight.Phase 3 Weeks 8-12Phase 3, the last four weeks of the plan, is where you really start focusing on regaining any muscle you may have lost, and hopefully growing new muscle as well! You'll follow a traditional four-day split:Phase ThreeMonday: Back and bicepsTuesday: RestWednesday: Shoulders and absThursday: RestFriday: Legs and calvesSaturday: Chest, triceps, and absSunday: RestWhere's the cardio, you ask? You can definitely still spend as much time walking the as you want and as your schedule allows, but the focus is to build muscle and strength during final four weeks. Remember, every bit of muscle you add actually burns fat, because muscle is ""metabolically active"" tissue, meaning it burns calories even at rest.Push-upsCan I do this at home?Home workout essentialsAdjustable dumbbellsSwiss/stability ballAdjustable benchJump ropeMedicine ballAdjustable barbellI did many of my workouts at home. Although it's tough to lift as heavy or hit the muscles with as much variety as you can at the gym, with just a little equipment you can still get a great workout.For me, being able to be home with my son and squeeze in a workout here and there was worth investing in a few key pieces of equipment. Dial-up dumbbells are ideal because they take up little space and offer a lot of variety. An adjustable bench or a platform is also a great accessory if you have the space. A jump rope, a medicine ball, and a stability ball don't cost much, and can be used a number of ways as well.If you have room in your life for one more item, I recommend a 25- or 30-pound barbell to which you can add weight plates. You can use it many ways for your legs, chest, shoulders, and arms. Buy new or check the local classifieds, Ebay, and Craigslist for people looking to unload equipment. Often, it has barely been used, and they are willing to sell it for a bargain just to make space.On the other hand, once you're ready, there's nothing wrong with bringing your baby to the daycare at your gym, if it has one. I waited until my son was sitting up and had good neck controlat around 6 monthsto take him.I know it can be hard to be away from your baby even for just an hour or two to exercise, but it's important to remember that your well-being affects the whole family. What's good for you is good for them, too!You can do this!So now that you have your plan to get back to training, be sure to watch the Nutrition Overview, Supplementation Overview, and Time Management Overview videos. Just like any other training plan, this is a complete approach, and making the most of it requires more than just breaking a sweat.JAMIE EASON SIGNATURE SERIESSUPPORT YOUR RESULTS WITH JAMIE EASON'S PERSONAL SUPPLEMENT LINE!

While many doctors will recommend you keep taking your prenatal multi while you're nursing, you want to be really careful taking more than that. There are even some supplements that you should definitely avoid if you're breastfeeding. Be sure to consult with your doctor and get their permission before starting any new supplement regimen, including this one.Truth be told, you really don't need much in the way of supplements post-pregnancy to stay in good health. But in my case, I did find that adding some clean protein made with natural ingredients really helped me meet extra nutritional needs I had after my son was bornespecially once I started training again.In this video and article, we're going to discuss whether supplemental protein has a place in your post-pregnancy plan. I'll share a couple of protein baking recipes that were staples in my house when I began training again. I'll also discuss supplement options for both nursing and non-nursing mothers.Supplementation Overview Watch The Video - 06:08How much protein do I need?Giving birth is hard on you. It takes time, rest, and plenty of calories for you to begin to recover. And if you're breastfeeding, you have a significantly higher demand being placed on your body from milk production.In addition to needing extra calories, nursing mothers also require additional protein. The recommended daily allowance of protein for pregnant and nursing women is nearly 50 percent above what it is for non-nursing women. And if you're looking to start training regularly or add muscle, those needs actually increase so you can adequately support exercise recovery and muscle growth.Once I began the Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer, I raised my daily protein intake to 1.5 grams per pound of body weight, which is what is usually recommended for athletes who are training hard and want to gain muscle. A level this high isn't necessary for everyone, though. The USDA recommends a minimum of just 71 grams of protein per day for breastfeeding moms, but every mom is a different size and weight, and may have different dietary and fitness goals.The recommended daily allowance of protein for pregnant and nursing women is nearly 50 percent above what it is for non-nursing women.A nursing mom needs between 200 and 500 extra calories per day to maintain milk production. But rather than counting calories, I simply listened to my body and paid attention to hunger cues, eating when I felt the urgeusually with additional protein. Since it's important to avoid certain types of fish when breastfeeding and I don't eat much dairy, it was sometimes hard to get enough protein from food alone.For this reason, I often relied on a natural protein powder like the ones I created for my Jamie Eason Signature Line. They're all free of artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, and sweeteners. I would either drink my protein as a shake or make homemade protein cookies, bars, and pancakes.If you know me, you know that I love baking with protein. Before I gave birth, I made all sorts of protein treats and froze them along with lots of other foods. These are easy snacks you can eat any timelike while you're nursing, or when you're too exhausted to even think about cooking.Some of my favorite protein recipes include pumpkin protein bars, cinnamon swirl protein bread, and many others from LiveFit and the Post-Pregnancy nutrition overview page!Beyond ProteinSo now that I've given you an overview of how protein can help you post-pregnancy, let's talk about some other specific supplement recommendations for both nursing and non-nursing moms.Aside from a protein powder made from natural ingredients, other safe options for nursing moms include a probiotic free of artificial sweeteners, as well as essential fatty acids such as krill oil, which is typically lowest in mercury. Another option to consider, especially with life being so busy, is a superfruit or greens product.As Dr. Dugan discusses in the video above, there may be some additional supplements that can help you, depending on your circumstances. Vitamin D, iron, and calcium are common deficiencies in new moms, for instance. Do your research, talk to your doctor, and learn your specific needs!  If you're not nursing, it's still important for you to get adequate protein to help regain any muscle you may have lost, so I recommend a natural protein powder, which you can take any time of daybut especially post-workout.In addition to the supplements I mentioned for nursing moms, you might also consider a pre-workout, multivitamin, and branched-chain amino acids.Supplements for nursing moms Jamie Eason Whey Protein Isolate Jamie Eason Skinny Bugs probiotic Jamie Eason Signature Series Krill oil Greens supplement Depending on needs; ask your doctor Calcium Iron Vitamin D Supplements for Bottle-Feeding Moms Jamie Eason Whey Protein Isolate Jamie Eason Skinny Bugs probiotic Jamie Eason Signature Series Krill oil Greens supplement Pre-workout Jamie Eason Signature Series Multi-vitamin Branched-chain amino acids Keep it simpleLet's be absolutely clear: You shouldn't rely on protein powder as your primary source of protein. This is true for all fit people, new mothers or not. You need whole foods and good nutrition, now more than ever! But if you're looking to fill the gaps in your diet, the ideas and recipes I provided here are a great place to start.Before you start training, be sure to watch the other videos in this series, including the Months 1-3 Overview and the nutrition, training, and time-management videos.

But you can definitely take some steps toward eating a balanced diet.To help you make the most of your time in this trainer, I've outlined some simple strategies you can use to add some predictability to your eating during a crazy time. I'll talk about the old ""eating for two"" myth, and outline a nutritional approach to help you feel your best and work your way back to fitness.Nutrition Overview Watch The Video - 09:10Jamie Eason's Post-Pregnancy Trainer: Nutrition OverviewShare Videohttp://content.jwplatform.com/previews/Y4aIQS8t-HhhvXS5R<iframe src=""http://content.jwplatform.com/players/Y4aIQS8t-HhhvXS5R.html"" width=""320"" height=""260"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""auto""></iframe>Share VideoRelatedNext UpShaun Stafford's Wave-Load Back Workout00:0009:0500:0009:05Nutrition for nursing momsGiving birth is hard on the body. It takes time, rest, and plenty of calories to recover. And if you're breastfeeding, there's extra demand being placed on your body for milk production. When a mom is breastfeeding, she needs additional calories, protein, and other nutrients to both maintain her body and provide protein in breast milk for her baby. On average, a nursing mother needs about 35% more protein a day than a non-nursing mother.If a nursing mother doesn't eat animal products, she may need extra vitamin B12 as well. Other crucial nutrients that new mothers sometimes find themselves deficient in include iron, calcium, and vitamins C and D. Eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, protein, whole grains, and dairy product should be adequate to ensure that a nursing mom gets all that she needs. But stay in dialogue with your doctor to make sure you're avoiding any deficiencies.Eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, protein, whole grains, and dairy product should be adequate to ensure that a nursing mom gets all that she needs.That may sound like a lot to keep in mind, but post-pregnancy rehabilitation expert Dr. Sheila Dugan says you can stay on top of the game by keeping these principles in mind:Prioritize protein at every mealEat whole foods more often than highly processed onesPrioritize nutrients and macronutrients more than caloriesPlan aheadSurround yourself with what you know are good foods.Better planning, better food, better health. That sounds a lot more approachable, doesn't it?The Magic of Meal PrepWhere do I get my extra calories?I'm a fan of protein-rich snacks. To get your extra calories for the day, just pick any two of the snacks on the meal list below, or just follow the sample meal plan for your day of the plan!I knew that once my baby was born, I wouldn't have much time for cooking. So my goal while pregnant was to cook in bulk and freeze individual portions so I'd have healthy meals ready and waiting after we brought the baby home. It was a lifesaver!Of course, meal prep doesn't sound like much fun if you've never done it before. But here's the key: Don't let it sneak up on you. Pick one day a weekpreferably on the weekendand assemble your team and your supplies. You can knock out a week's worth of dinners in a single afternoon.Heading into the store when you're exhausted and in a hurry to get home to your baby is a guaranteed way of forgetting what you need and grabbing lots of stuff you don't want. Instead, have several of your favorite healthy meal recipes printed out and ready to go, so when you go to the store, you'll be sure to get exactly what you need.You may take this approach out of necessity at first, but that could change. Once you get into my training plan and start to see your body change, don't be surprised if you stick with itbecause it works!How much should I eat?When you were pregnant, you probably heard the old saying about ""eating for two."" Unfortunately, this isn't quite true. During pregnancy, your caloric intake only needs to increase by around 300 calories a dayalthough it can sure feel like more than that when you're having a craving!So what about after pregnancy? The general guideline is that you need to take in an additional 200-500 calories more than normal to support milk production. Here's a calculator to help you determine what that number looks like for you.Calorie Calculator WeightSelect OnePoundsKilogramsMinimum caloric intake ***Note: Dont count calories too strictly during this time. Listen to your hunger cues and make sure youre eating enough, especially while training.If you aren't breastfeeding, Dr. Dugan advises, you can get back to your regular pre-pregnancy calorie count once you're done healing from the birth and pregnancy. However, once you start training more intensely, consider raising your calories by about 500 per day, as well as increasing protein intake to around a gram of protein per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight.But bear in mind, these numbers are only guidelines. If you feel hungry, eat moreespecially while you're breastfeeding. I did! This isn't the time to count every calorie. The goal instead should be to make every calorie count. Try to eat the most nutritious foods possible at all opportunities.What types of foods should I eat?Whether you're breastfeeding or not, make every effort to eat wholesome foods that have been minimally processed. Focus on nutrient-packed vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean meats, and healthy fats. The approved foods list from my LiveFit trainer will work perfectly for you here as a reference.Note: I've also included sample meal plans for every day of the trainer, so when you go to get your day's workout, you can see those, too.Whether you're breastfeeding or not, make every effort to eat wholesome foods that have been minimally processed.But if recipes are your thing, here's a comprehensive list of the healthy options listed in the daily pages of the Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainer.

Staying Fit While Pregnant
Not sure how to maintain your fitness while you're pregnant? Fit mama and FitMiss athlete Noora Kuusivuori has the info you're looking for!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/staying-fit-while-pregnant.html,"Being pregnant is an extraordinary experience. There's nothing else like it in the world. Your body goes through amazing changes, and you live each day of those nine months knowing you're growing another human! However, strong opinions abound about what you should and shouldn't do as a pregnant woman, especially when it comes to fitness. The further along I get in my pregnancy, the more likely I am to hear questions like ""Why are you still in the gym?"" and ""Why are you still lifting weights?"" My question back to them is always ""Why not?"" I trained before I was pregnant, and now, well into my third trimester, I'll keep training. Staying active has helped me stay healthy and within the recommended weight-gain guidelines, which is about 30 pounds. This is my second pregnancy, so I know that working out helps my postpartum recovery feel easier, and the road to getting my body back won't seem so overwhelming. Staying active has helped Noora stay healthy and within the recommended weight-gain guidelines.If you're pregnant and want to know a little more about how to train, eat, and use supplements, then read on! I'll go over my pregnancy fitness regimen and how it differs from my usual routine. Then, you can take that gorgeous baby bump of yours and hit the gym!*Before beginning or modifying an exercise program during pregnancy, consult with your doctor or midwife. Lifting Weights If you were training with weights before you were pregnant, it's generally safe to continue while you're pregnant. In fact, current national and international guidelines recommend that healthy women should perform resistance training throughout pregnancy.1-3 However, make sure you check with your doctor or midwife before starting. Lifting weights is important, because strong muscles will help you carry that extra person with you at all times. Having a strong back and legs will also help alleviate some of the pain associated with a growing belly. Improvements in overall body strength, core strength, and posture can prevent musculoskeletal discomforts and help during labor and delivery.4 Working out while you're pregnant can help alleviate pain, improve posture, and strengthen your core.When you're in the gym, make sure you listen to your body. You can't get ""more fit"" while you're pregnant, so adjust your mindset. Stick to maintenance instead of gaining or losing. If something doesn't feel right, just skip it. Exercises that call for you to lie flat on your back or lean your abdomen against a pad may start to feel uncomfortable, so look for alternatives. I love using dumbbells, because I can work them around my kangaroo pouch. In general, I've decreased the weight I use by 30-50 percent. I still want to challenge myself, but I also want to make sure I'm being safe. I like to slow down my repetitions, do negatives, or do more reps than I normally would. You can still feel the burn, even with lighter weight. Stretching I typically don't have the time or patience for yoga classes, but because I can't train as intensely as I usually do, I've started to explore them. And I can honestly say that my body loves doing yoga! As my baby gets bigger, my muscles start to feel more tense. Stretching has helped to loosen me up and keeps me feeling limber and ready for labor. The more flexible I am, the easier it is for me to move around. It's especially important in that third trimester, when it's damned near impossible to bend over or reach anything below my knees!MusclePharm: 100% Whey IsolateUltra-Fast-Release Protein To Accelerate Muscle Building!Go Now!Nutrition I didn't eat enough protein during my first pregnancy. Like most women, I just craved carbohydrates. My son was born two months early, and he was tiny! He was far smaller than a set of twins born at the same gestational age. I asked their mother what she did to make sure that her babies were a healthy weight, and her answer was that she ate lots of protein. So, I took a leaf out of her book during my second pregnancy and made sure to eat more protein. I've used MusclePharm 100% Whey Isolate in shakes and bakes throughout my pregnancy and have done a much better job getting enough protein this time around. I also add my favorite Combat Crunch bars as snacks. To grow big and strong, your baby needs a balanced, varied, and healthy dietjust like you!Along with protein, I eat plenty of carbohydrates. When I'm not pregnant, I usually stick to a pretty low-carb diet, so eating as much fruit, quinoa, oatmeal, and rice as I want has been pretty fun. I also try to eat a good variety of healthy vegetables like spinach, kale, and other greens. For healthy fat sources, I like avocado, olive oil, salmon, nuts, and coconut oil. To grow big and strong, your baby needs a balanced, varied, and healthy dietjust like you! Hydration When you're pregnant, you share fluids with another human, so it's especially important to drink a lot of water. There's no reason to carry around a gallon jug, but instead of those sodas or juices you usually drink, make the switch to water. Supplementation Supplements like fat burners and pre-workouts should be cut as soon as you have a positive pregnancy test, but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy the benefits of other supplements. A prenatal vitamin with folic acid should be first on your list. Besides the MusclePharm Isolate protein powder, I also like to take MusclePharm fish oil, because the DHA is important for my baby's brain and eye development. The 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services dietary guidelines recommend that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding consume 8-12 ounces of seafood per week, or about 300-900 milligrams of EPA+DHA per day.5 Studies suggest that children whose mothers consumed DHA during pregnancy have better problem-solving skills.6,7 Studies suggest that children whose mothers consumed DHA during pregnancy have better problem-solving skills.I've also continued to use BCAAs, which are generally considered safe to use during pregnancy, but I still recommend talking to your doctor before using them. High levels of BCAAs in children may pose some risk, so if you're already getting enough protein via whole foods, you may not need to supplement with additional BCAAs.Mental Health Growing a new life is a magical process, but it can also be scary and stressful. Do your best to enjoy this time. Stop worrying about how you'll lose the baby weight or if you've decorated the baby's room enough. Instead, cherish all the kicks and punches, and remember that the pregnancy period is just a short time of your life. You can start bonding with your baby while he or she is still in your belly.

They're tiny, delicate, a little wild, andof courseadorable. Know what else they are? Unpredictable. Who can blame them? They've been dropped into a brand-new world, and they don't even know what they need yetexcept you, of course.From day one, that little person pretty much owns you and your time. Trust methat will change, but not overnight. And even when you finally feel ready to start working out and your doctor says it's OK, you still might not see how you could possibly find the time.I know the feeling! I was there too. But with experience, I found that post-pregnancy was a great opportunity to examineand attack some of the biggest reasons women say they ""can't"" get fit. That's right: This is an opportunity!On this page, I'll talk about some of the ways you can rebuild your fit life in the middle of a crazy, unpredictable schedule. We'll go over managing your expectations, preparing your space, setting your priorities, and a skill that, let's face it, many moms have trouble mastering: sharing responsibility.Let's figure out how to make this work. You deserve it!Time Management Overview Watch The Video - 10:59Solution 1 Manage your expectations Jamie's Nine-Month PlanMonths 1-3: Post-pregnancy circuitsMonths 4-6: Post-pregnancy fitness trainerMonths 7-9: LiveFitMany women find they are able to exercise to some degree throughout most of their pregnancy, depending on their specific circumstances and what their doctor says is OK. But all of that changes when the baby comes. You don't even know what you'll be recovering fromonly that you'll be recovering. For instance, I developed a painful condition called De Quervain syndrome because I could only nurse my son on one side. I definitely never saw that coming!But acute conditions like that aside, your first couple of months as a mom are still pretty difficult, whether this is your first child or your fourth. People say it's like a haze or a dreamand they're right. You sleep when you canor if you can. You struggle to solve problems you knew you'd have, and some you couldn't have predicted. Plenty of women also have to deal with going back to work, or their partner doing so, before they feel ready.Because there's so much going on, many women gladly wait until they get a ""green light"" from their doctor to begin exercising, usually at around 6-8 weeks. But if it takes longer than that for you, then that's OK. I can't emphasize that enough!I know that when you're in bed and not feeling great about how your body looks, it can be easy to set big, ambitious goals on little, ambitious timelines. Resist the urge! The nine-month plan I describe in the program overview is just one possible outcome. You might need longer than thatmaybe a lot longer. That's fine. What matters far more is simply making progress and making healthy choices.My biggest advice is to make the three-week ramp-up plan to the Post-Pregnancy Fitness Trainerwhich I talk about in the Months 1-3 Overview last as long as you need it to. But while you're keeping things simple, keep your eyes open for opportunities to make a ""system"" to give yourself a bit more time. Maybe it's as simple as having your partner take a daily feeding, so you can slip into your workout clothesor just into bed.And if your body says that you need to hit ""pause"" for a few days, you can just pick up where you left off when you're ready.And if your body says that you need to hit ""pause"" for a few days, you can just pick up where you left off when you're ready.Solution 2 Prepare your spaceHome workout essentialsAdjustable dumbbellsSwiss/stability ballAdjustable bench Jump ropeMedicine ballAdjustable barbellI've heard many, many women say they ""can't"" train effectively at home for one reason or another. They don't have the physical space, for instance, or they simply can't avoid getting pulled in a million different directions. I understand these concerns, but I think that in most cases, there are solutions. Prepare your space before you start working out, and you'll be able to thrive in it!What does this mean? Let me give you a few examples. I did the majority of my workouts during this trainer at home, but make no mistake: I didn't have a ""home gym,"" per se. All I had were a few key implements, but I chose them carefully.Sometimes, you may have to train in one room, sometimes another, depending on what's happening and who's sleeping or playing where.For instance, rather than buying a whole range of dumbbells, I picked out adjustable ones. They take up the same amount of space, but you won't outgrow them in just a few workouts like you do with nonadjustable bells.I could tell you to always train in the same place in your housesay, the garage or the living roombut that doesn't always work. Sometimes, you may have to train in one room, sometimes another, depending on what's happening and who's sleeping or playing where. So instead, I'll just say to have a dedicated space where you store your fitness essentials, so you can find them quickly and take them where you need to go to train.I's crucial to make everything as convenient as possible. All it takes is one excuse like, ""Ugh, I have to go to the garage to find the so-and-so"" to make a workout disappear. That's one reason to train during the morninglike, early morning before your excuses have a chance to wake up and get in the way.Put your workout clothes by your bed so you can scoop them up and not wake anyone. Prepare tomorrow's workout today, and watch your excuses go up in smoke.Solution 3 Establish your fitness prioritiesI know what it's like to feel as if you have to choose between options you'd prefer not to have to choose betweenlike ""sleep or a workout,"" for instance, or ""dinner or cleaning."" But it's a part of parenthood, and especially new parenthood. So what do you do ifor rather, whenyou find yourself in a position where you can't do it all? Stick to your fitness priorities.Here's what they are during this trainer:SleepMovementWorking outNutritionLet me break it down.Sleep: Fitness needs sleep. Even with my background in fitness, getting back to the gym wasn't even on my radar until my son was 3 months oldand barely then. I was waiting for him to get on a more regular sleep schedule, and I was still feeling tired more often than not. I know for some women, even this timeline seems ambitious.But I also knew from experience that without proper sleep, I wouldn't be able to regain my lost muscle anyway, so I was OK waiting. This can be hard for some people to understand, especially if they've never really prioritized sleep in the past. But those of us in the fitness industry know that if you want to change your body, you need sleep. Your baby definitely knows this! So until you are getting sleep regularly, that's your highest fitness priority.Movement: During the first 1-3 months after your pregnancy, you're ahead of the game if you're able to get outside and walk every day. Not run, walk. It's OK if that's as far as your fitness ambitions go for a while. Simply moving is a much higher priority than getting fit.  Working out: If you have family, friends, or a sitter to watch the baby, you might even be able to squeeze in some time at the gym. But, as I mentioned earlier, it's not crucial. When you're ready, simply working out on a consistent basis is a higher priority than crushing it at the gym. A lot of babies enjoy watching their moms exercise, especially with some music on. You can have your own little audience while you take the first steps in regaining your pre-baby body.Nutrition: It may surprise you to see nutrition here, toward the bottom. When you do something like prepare for a competition or event, sure, nutrition is the highest priority. But new moms usually can't afford to be that scientific. Your baby's digestion is still immature, and if you're breastfeeding, some of your favorite fit foods may make for some sleepless nights.Should you make healthy choices? Of course. But understand that, for a while, simply getting enough calories is more important than dialing in your macros. If you're really hungry, it may be a sign that you need to eat more! Your body is going through a lot right now. Babies have a way of complicating the best-laid plans, so get ready for it.Solution 4 Share responsibilityYou've heard people say it takes a village to raise a child. They're not lying! And once you set the goal of reclaiming your fitness level and physique, you'll need make use of whatever support system you have. Those who love you will want you to feel good, and they know that being a mother isn't easy. So let them help you.I know what you're saying: ""It's not that simple."" I said the same thing. But once I began to look for ways I could share responsibility rather than taking everything on myself, my life definitely changed for the better.You've heard people say it takes a village to raise a child. They're not lying! And once you set the goal of reclaiming your fitness level and physique, you'll need make use of whatever support system you have.Let your partner take a feeding or strap on the carrier so you can have a little time to yourself. Invite over a friend or hire a babysitter, even if you're just heading into the garage to lift some dumbbells. If you have family locally, let them watch the baby for an hour or two. When the time comes, consider dropping your little one at your gym's daycare, if it has one.Sure, it can be hard to let go, but think of it this way: You're modeling a healthy, reasonable approach to the fit life for your child to follow. In the long term, isn't that the most important thing?The Time of Your LifeNo two pregnancies are the same, and no two children are the same. So I can't predict the specific challenges that will try to get in the way of your post-pregnancy fitness goals. But with the tools I've outlined here, I hope you'll be better equipped to handle whatever comes your way.Now be sure to watch the Months 1-3 Overview , Training Overview, Nutrition Overview, and Supplementation Overview to learn everything you need to take control of your physique and get back to fit!JAMIE EASON SIGNATURE SERIESSUPPORT YOUR RESULTS WITH JAMIE EASON'S PERSONAL SUPPLEMENT LINE!

Women:  Stay Fit While Pregnant - Here's How!
Are you pregnant and not sure about healthy weight gain and activity level? Moms-to-be you can stay fit during this time by using the following nutrition and training guidelines to ensure both mom and the baby’s health! Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/stay_fit_pregnancy.htm,"Diet  Good pregnancy nutrition is vital to delivering a healthy baby. Your child is totally dependent on you for nourishment, so eating well for two is of utmost importance. It is worth the time and effort to plan a well rounded, balanced diet, which will help insure that your baby is getting adequate nutrients during pregnancy, and which will also provide you the needed energy to get you through the day.  Try not to worry about gaining weight. Pregnancy isn't the time to be cutting back on calories. In fact, a gradual, steady weight gain is a good sign, in making sure your baby is gaining the necessary weight. Cutting calories not only robs your baby's delicate growing organs, but it robs your body of needed nutrition, and has the potential to slow your metabolism, the very thing you do not want.  Pregnancy Articles:  Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide! - By Bryna DeLuca Weight Training & Pregnancy! - By David Robson So You're Pregnant: Now What? - By Shannon Clark Other Pregnancy Articles...  Remember when choosing your diet, quality is more important than quantity. Most pregnant women need about 300 additional calories per day. Daily calories should consist of grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, nuts and dairy products.  Serving size recommendations for the average, healthy pregnant woman include 6-11 servings of breads and grains, two-four servings of fruit, four or more servings of vegetables, four servings of dairy products, and three servings of protein sources (meat, poultry, fish, eggs or nuts).  There is no reason to avoid foods you crave as long as you eat in moderation to avoid excessive weight gain, so limit saturated fats and sweets. Eat 5-6 small meals every two to three hours. Even if you're not hungry, your developing baby needs regular sustenance, and high frequency eating ensures proper blood glucose levels inhibiting the dreaded insulin spike, which causes that afternoon energy crash.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  How Often Should You Eat?  Along with increased attention to your diet, you are likely trying to eat every three hours. Do you have to be anal about this? Absolutely not!   Author: Shannon Clark  As a pregnant mom, you don't need anything else to rob yourself of energy, so avoid skipping meals. Prenatal vitamins and mineral supplements are usually recommended by most prenatal care providers, but should not be used in place of eating a balanced diet, however.  Always consult with your health care provider before taking vitamins or supplements. Most importantly, avoid alcohol, smoking and harmful drugs. Try to avoid caffeine as much as possible. If you need a cup, go decaffeinated. Always keep it safe for baby. View Pre-Natal Vitamins Sorted By Top Seller Here. Exercise  Exercise is also very important, despite the changes in your growing belly. It may seem like a perfect time to sit back and relax, but in fact, pregnancy can be a great time to stay active.  A good pregnancy workout has several benefits for the mom-to-be. It will help increase circulation, improve your posture, help with sleeplessness and help to control your weight while toning your muscles, making it easier to get back into shape after you deliver.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Pregnant & Working Out.   I recently losta lot of weight and now I'm really starting to miss working out. I've been told that I can do cardio but only walking and at low speeds.   Started By: Stoofinoof  Exercise also helps you stay flexible, which will benefit you during labor and delivery. Make sure you do not over do it. Hormones occur during pregnancy, which soften ligaments and connective tissues to prepare your body for labor. Stay away from fast, jerky movements at all costs because it could easily lead to injury.  Focus on moving at a slow and controlled rate. Moderate repetition incorporating low weight or light resistance during this time in your life, will insure an injury-free and healthy pregnancy. Remember, this is not the time to train, but to maintain.  First, be sure to talk with your doctor to make sure it is safe to continue your exercise routine, to identify such conditions as preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy). This time spent with the doctor can help identify any specific risk factors to your individual situation.   Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is a medical condition where hypertension arises in pregnancy in association with significant amounts of protein in the urine.   Because preeclampsia refers to a set of symptoms rather than any causative factor, it is established that there can be many different causes for the syndrome.    Low-Impact Aerobics     An excellent form of  cardiovascular exercise for moms-to-be, is low-impact aerobics. This involves no jumping or hopping movements, or stepping upon any type of platform, putting you at risk of jarred joints, but includes rhythmic movements that keep one foot on the floor at all times. You can find these kinds of classes at your local gym or YMCA. If you prefer working out in the privacy of your own home, pregnancy DVDs/videos are available at most stores.

[ Check Out The Cardio Super Feature Here! ]    Exercising In Water      An ideal aerobic exercise for pregnant women is  swimming. Due to the buoyancy of the water it eliminates any  stress on your joints and provides gentle resistance for maintaining muscle tone. The same goes for pool walking or a water aerobics class, typically done waist deep.   RELATED VIDEO   Water Aerobics Exercises: Deep Water Exercises For Water Aerobics!

Walking     Walking is one of the best and safest ways to get exercise and is easily worked into almost any daily routine. Taking a brisk walk through the mall, around a neighborhood park with a friend, or an after dinner, sunset stroll with your husband, can be a fun and convenient way to stay in shape with little or no cost to you.

Strength Bands     Depending on how you use them, strength bands (also called  resistant bands) can be great for beginners as well as more advanced exercisers, to add some light to medium resistance to your workouts, without the use of free weights. You can use them for basic exercises or to add intensity to traditional moves.   These bands are made from latex material or thick elastic cording and are available with or without handles. Bands range anywhere from $6 to $20, depending on how many you get and where you buy them, which is nice for the budget-conscious mom. They are lightweight and easily transported from home to office or vice versa.

[ Click here to learn more. ] Note: Always use caution when using strength bands, for the possibility of breakage. Weight Training  To insure the safety of you and your future newborn here's some guidelines to follow:  Perform 2 exercises per body part, versus 3 sets each. Increase your rest periods to 2 minutes between sets, to avoid getting too hot and a dangerously elevated heart rate (Keep below 140 beats per minute). And be sure to avoid holding your breath at any given time.  Keep the resistance low to moderate depending on your stage of pregnancy and your reps between 8-10 (Stay away from reaching muscle failure). Eliminate all exercises that require lying on your back. This position may decrease the blood flow to the uterus and therefore the baby. Eliminate all abdominal exercises or exercises that require lying on your stomach (Ex. Lying leg curls). Eliminate exercises that may cause loss of balance. Lunges and squats should be substituted for seated leg curls and leg extensions. Free weights may also add to your loss of balance, so the use of machines is recommended to prevent joint injuries. If free weights are used, you should always pay close attention to your form.

They are also encouraged during the postpartum period to promote healing of perineal tissues, increase urinary control and help these muscles return to their healthy state after giving birth.

Get Plenty Of Rest   Sleep is very important for the mom-to-be. During the first trimester, your body works to protect and nurture the developing baby. Your body makes more blood for the forming placenta (the organ that nourishes the fetus until birth), making your heart pump faster.   As the baby grows, you may find it difficult or uncomfortable to lie down as before. Taking catnaps throughout the day can be a great way to get that extra needed sleep, you may be lacking during the night.

How Preparing For Competition Is Like Pregnancy.
The following article may sound especially familiar to women who are already mothers. Let's take a look at a humorous side of competition training.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/blackburn6.htm,"As I prepared for my most recent figure competition, I could not help but acknowledge the many similarities between the feelings involved when pregnant and when preparing for a competition. The following article may sound especially familiar to women who are already mothers. Let's take a look at a humorous side of competition training.  Planning It Out   To begin with, preparation for ""the big event"" takes planning and a lot of money. After all, you want the best for this new part of your life. There are also many unexpected incidentals that come up which eat at your pocketbook. New clothing, professional experts, pampering, and educational materials all compete for your time and wallet!  When starting to prepare for this endeavor, you find yourself wondering how your body will change and look as time goes by. You are going to go through some big transitions! Will you even recognize yourself after all of this? You may even doubt your abilities to embark on the challenge and wonder if you are up to performing in this important role.  Be careful not to compare yourself to others. You do not have to live up to the image presented by someone else in this same role; you only need do your personal best. Be prepared to be given tons of advice and be willing also to seek out help from those who have already been there.  You'll find yourself really wanting to be the finest you can and savoring this special time in your life. Of course, you will want to do your best as you will not have a chance to do this particular event over again.  You will find that friends and family will be asking you, ""When is the date?"" and ""How much longer do you have?"" You may also feel like your body is on display for others to watch as you make progress towards the end result. As the changes in your body become more noticeable, you may feel like you are the center of attention.  Even strangers may inquire about what you are experiencing. Don't be surprised if you are poked and asked if your stomach can be viewed! Another common question will be about your weight status and how it has changed since you began this experience.  At this wonderful stage in your life you will want to make sure that you get enough of the right vitamins and supplements. A good cream for stretch marks may also be in order. You will need to get plenty of rest and take care of your body. As the big day gets closer, increasingly more ailments begin. The process is getting more difficult! You may get very tired, have achy muscles, and experience mood swings! People will learn not to take your emotions and attitudes personally. You may start to worry what will happen if there are any complications.    Tips & Tricks For The First Time Figure Competitor!  If you think that competing in a figure competition is less strenuous, or requires less dedication than competing in a bodybuilding competition, think again. Find out how I train, diet and much more...  [ Click here to learn more. ] Here is another big one. You will likely find yourself hungry and craving specific foods! You don't want to gain too much weight, though. Making the right kind of gains is important.  Another observation to point out is that if your relationship or marriage is not already strong, this process and event will probably cause strain and not make the relationship any stronger. There is a great deal of stress involved and even though it is a fun time, it can easily overtake the whole family. Make sure all people involved are supportive.  The day is drawing nearer. Your nervousness starts changing into feelings of just wanting it to be over! This is all starting to take its toll on your body and mind.   When the day does arrive, just shoot modesty out the window! There is no place for it in this environment. Your body will be exposed to a multitude of strangers and you will probably be in less clothing than ever before. Did you ever think you would be revealing yourself in this way to so many people and so up close and personal?  Conclusion     How Hard Is Preparing For A Competition? One Of The Hardest Things A Person Could Do.           Pretty Hard, But Not That Hard!           Not Really That Hard.                Finally, the big day arrives. While performing it may seem to take forever! You are really trying to do your best. Yet in other ways it is really quite short compared to the preparation time. When it is all said and done, you may find yourself reflecting on all the months prior to the event.  You prepared and looked forward to this day and now feel a slight sadness that it is over. So much time, effort and care went into preparing and now it is done. Yet, look at what you have accomplished! It is most definitely something for which you can take pride. It was a lot of hard work and you did it! You will be able to enjoy the results of your hard work for a long time to come; the pain was worth it!  Shall we do it again?"

Suggestions For Others  The biggest obstacle for me was the diet, and since diet is 80% of your results, you need to have it perfect. I would suggest hiring a nutritionist to create your diet so you can get the best results possible, and learn about nutrition along the way.  A trainer is a great investment when starting out so you can learn proper form and technique. The biggest key is being patient and believing in yourself. It will take time, hard work, dedication, and sacrifice, but in the end you'll learn a lot about yourself and you'll be stronger and healthier because of it.

It wasn't until I got married and had a baby that I started to gain weight. I spent the next three years overweight and depressed. I hated the way I looked and the way I felt. In my mind, everyone around me seemed smaller and fit. I was living like a couch potato not realizing the lifestyle I was being dragged into. ""Insecure"" is the best word to describe how I felt during that time. My daily routine was getting up early and barely eating anything, mostly junk foods. I spent nights crying because of the way I looked. I didn't want to go shopping for clothes because I would get depressed. The worst part was that I knew what it was like to be skinny and addicted to the gym. And I was so far from it. Getting older and having a family doesn't mean you are supposed to get unhealthy and stop thinking about yourself. I had to make my health a priority. Not being able to look at myself in pictures and not liking what I saw was my turning point. In June of 2008, I decided to change my life. Not only did I want to fit in my old jeans, but I wanted a healthier lifestyle. My aunt had the same struggles and achieved her weight loss goals. She gave me the tools to start my own path. It was up to me to follow in her steps. So I began this journey without any regrets. I knew it was the right thing to do. It took me five months to achieve my weight loss goal. I realized that this is not just a diet. This is a healthy lifestyle. I'm inspired to help other achieve their goals too.  Click Image To Enlarge.I'm Inspired To Help Other Achieve Their Goals Too. How I Did It  First of all, I needed to concentrate on my goal. I set a date, kept a journal, and did research on nutrition and fitness. I knew it was not going to be easy, but I still took the risk. It was all worth it. It was hard at first to take my body out of a sedentary routine and force it to work out. It took help and knowledge of a family member to get me up and going. I had to learn first how to distinguish between what was healthy and what was junk food. My main objective was to replace foods with healthy ones. I started by taking all the junk food out of the kitchen and bought healthy, nutritious foods. Another thing that helped me was looking at old pictures of myself when I used to be fit and imagined myself fitting again in those clothes. I took a lot of before pictures and after pictures to see my progress each month. That alone kept me going. During this journey I completely submitted myself to achieving my weight loss goal.

Diet  I followed a basic eating plan. I kept an eye on the nutritional facts on everything. I didn't deprive myself of food. I replaced them with nutritious ones. I had 5-to-6 meals a day, small portions with snacks in between. I also forced myself to eat more vegetables and fruits. I also had plenty of water during the day and always allowed myself one cheat meal every week. I was always making sure I ate all my portions and keep up with my exercise plan.

Training  My routine included lots of cardio and weights. I remember going to the park and not even knowing if I could run. When I tried it felt like I was carrying shopping bags in my hands. That didn't stop me. First I started walking for half an hour. Then after the weeks passed I moved up to jogging and walking for 30-or-40 minutes. This routine was done five days per week with two days of rest. If there was a day I couldn't go to the park, I would follow kickboxing videos. Besides cardio, my other plan of attack was my weight routine. I did weight training three days per week.Day 1: Cardio And Full Body WorkoutDay 2: Cardio And Full Body WorkoutDay 3: RestDay 4: Cardio And Full Body WorkoutDay 5: CardioDay 6: RestDay 7: Cardio Full Body Workout: Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 15 repsDumbbell Curls: 3 sets of 15 repsMilitary Press: 3 sets of 15 repsBent Over Barbell Rows: 3 sets of 15 repsSeated Triceps Press: 3 sets of 15 repsSeated Calf Raises: 3 sets of 15 repsBarbell Squats: 4 sets of 20 repsDumbbell Lunges: 4 sets of 15 repsCrunches: 3 sets of 20 repsReverse Crunches: 3 sets of 20 repsSide Bends: 3 sets of 15 repsButt-Ups: 3 sets of 15-20 secondsAir Bike: 3 sets of 20 repsquickstart_training(""Full Body Workout"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=Dumbbell+Bench+Press:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Dumbbell+Curls:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Military+Press:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Bent+Over+Barbell+Rows:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Seated+Triceps+Press:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Seated+Calf+Raises:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Barbell+Squats:+4+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Dumbbell+Lunges:+4+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Crunches:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Reverse+Crunches:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Side+Bends:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Butt-Ups:+3+sets+of+15-20+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Air+Bike:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&TotalExercises=13&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=Jesse+Velazquez&name=Full+Body+Workout""); Get A Printable Log Of Full Body Workout.

There's no better reward than knowing that all your hard work is paying off.  Click Image To Enlarge.There's No Better Reward Than KnowingThat All Your Hard Work Is Paying Off. Suggestions For Others  Don't skip meals, and if you don't feel that hungry, eat something light. This will help you avoid sugar and late-night cravings. Don't skip breakfast, it's the most important meal of the day. It will give you energy and make you feel full. If you are in a hurry and don't have time to cook, make a power smoothie that will leave you full.  I find very important that if you drink a lot of protein, you should also get lots of fiber and plenty of water.  Don't deprive yourself of foods. Simply choose the healthy ones! Replace them! Look for new ingredients and learn new recipes.  Don't let other people bring you out of focus. Invite them to join your healthy journey. Find a workout buddy to keep yourself motivated and also help motivate others.  Change your weight lifting routine every 6-to-8 weeks to avoid getting your muscles accustomed.  Give your muscles a break to rest. Avoid doing strength training too many days in a row. Your muscles will build and repair during rest.  Make sure you have quality shoes for your chosen activity. Picking the right shoes for a cardio workout (like running) will prevent injuries.  Try new activities. Doing the same thing can lead to plateaus, boredom and injuries.  To reach a healthy weight you need to be patient. No miracle pills or diet will make you lose weight the right and healthy way.  Practice your favorite sports (like volleyball, softball, tennis, rock climbing, and basketball). It'll be a fun workout when you play with your friends. Personally, I love boxing!

Bodybuilding For Babyboomers - Shaping Up For Summer, The Baby Boomer Way!
Shaping up the baby boomer way means training hard, yet training smart. That means employing science and the wisdom that only comes with age to our training. Learn why!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babyboom27.htm,"Shaping Up For Summer, The Baby Boomer Way!Click Here For Part Two! While many parts of the U.S. continue to be blasted by snowstorms it's hard to change the mindset to think about warmer weather and summer activities. But, beware boomers; bathing suit season is just around the corner. It's time to get ready.  Shaping up the baby boomer way means training hard, yet training smart. This Legendary Fitness team wants you fit for this summer, and many summers to come. That means employing science and the wisdom that only comes with age to our training. Let's let those kids burn themselves out with their training programs that maximize gains at the high cost of lost training time from injuries. We know better.  Get Your Nutrition In Order! Keep a training journal. Write down everything you eat. Every piece of gum, candy and taste of food. Hundreds of calories are ingested each day as a taste or just a bite as we are running to another activity. You need to be aware of exactly how much you are putting in your mouth each day. [Diane: I like to use the Gold's Gym training journal due to the two-page format. It allows you to view daily resistance training, nutrition and cardio. And there's plenty of room for notes. Richard: I don't use anything formal to log daily nutrition. Just one piece of paper lasts a long time as I use my own codes, (EW for egg whites) and eat the same thing on a daily basis when dieting.]  Clean out the pantry. Eliminate temptations by throwing away cookies, cakes and snacks. DON""T feel bad about the waste of money. You're a tough Baby boomer on route to a Legendary Physique this summer and will not let $15 worth of Oreos and pretzels stand in your way of success.  Re-stock the pantry and refrigerator with appropriate foods to build a better body.  Brown rice, oatmeal, steel-cut oats, rye or whole wheat bread Eggs Canned tuna Lean protein such as chicken, fish and beef Green vegetables such as peppers, broccoli, celery, green beans and cucumbers Bagged salads when on the run Fruits that are low on the glycemic index such as strawberries and melon Low sodium soy sauce, salsa, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, non-stick cooking spray Sweet potatoes Non-fat cottage cheese and yogurt Non-fat milk Almonds Sugar-free popsicles when in a pinch  Stock up on protein supplements. Eating small meals about every three hours makes it difficult to consume so many 'real' meals. That's where protein supplements come in handy. You'll need two kinds. Whey Protein. Good to use pre and post workout, or any time as a small meal when you want to keep the carbohydrate content low. [    Diane: I like several different brands and rotate to keep from getting bored.     My favorites include, EAS Precision Protein, EAS Simply Whey, (a great price performer with great taste), Next Designer Whey (always a good taste choice for a beginner) and AST VP2. Richard: I like to get a good blend of the different Proteins including whey isolates and concentrate and caseins, so I choose Pro-blend 55.]  Meal Replacement Shakes. (MRPs) Use these for snack meals and for times when eating a real meal is impossible. Keep a shaker, a bottle of water and an MRP at your desk and in your car so you are always prepared. Personal favorites for both of us include one of the oldest, Met-RX, chocolate and EAS Myoplex Lite or regular Myoplex in Tropical flavors.  Keep protein bars on hand.  It's not always practical to whip out a shaker bottle to mix up an MRP, so protein bars are a great choice. Fat levels tend to be high, so keep that in mind when planning your day. Carbohydrate levels can be extremely high to the point where you just might be better off having a brownie, so please choose wisely. EAS makes a low-carb bar, advertised at 3 grams of carbs. Just remember, they're not counting the carbohydrates from glycerine, which takes the count up to around 20 grams. But, 20 is still a reasonable amount of carbs for a protein bar. Diane's favorite, EAS Low-Carb Strawberry and the new Detour bar, which can satisfy any craving for a Snickers. But, at 9 grams of fat and 290 calories, you better plan this snack carefully into your daily meal plan. Richard's favorite, EAS Advant Chewy Chocolate Chip, nice and cold right out of the refrigerator.  Now that your refrigerator and pantry are well stocked, let's examine putting these ingredients together into meals.  Breakfast:    Steel-cut oats, whey protein and blueberries  OR Egg white omelet, whole-wheat toast and melon  OR Oatmeal, cottage cheese, and strawberries*  Snack One:  Protein Bar OR MRP  OR Whey protein and small piece of fruit  OR Cottage cheese with fruit  OR  Yogurt with strawberries  Lunch:    Grilled chicken, beef or fish with salad and brown rice  OR Tuna on rye bread  OR Oven roasted turkey with sweet potato and green vegetables  Snack Two:   See snack one  Dinner:   Grilled chicken or fish with salad and green vegetables  Snack Three: (if needed)   Whey protein or cottage cheese  Portion size will need to be determined by you. Do you need to lose weight? Then you need to expend more calories than you take in. Is your goal to put on lots of lean, sexy muscle mass? Then, you may need to have seven or eight small meals per day, or keep the five to six meals per day with added calories at each meal.  What you should see from this guide is that there is plenty of lean protein, as well as a good amount of complex carbohydrates to provide the necessary fuel for daily activities, including your job and your training sessions. Taper carbohydrates down to low levels as the day goes on, as you will not need the same levels of fuel for sleeping as with your daily activities.  *Diane: Much to Richard's chagrin, my favorite breakfast is one that I have each day. I mix cottage cheese and cut up strawberries into my cooked oatmeal, then sprinkle with cinnamon and some Sweet 'n Low or Stevia. It's not pretty, but so good. Thanks to Western CT's busiest trainer, Trish Erwin for the breakfast tip.  Getting your nutrition in order takes planning! We won't kid you here. You are going to need to plan ahead and be prepared. Grill up a week's worth of chicken breasts and stick them in the freezer. Prepare several days worth of brown rice and store in throwaway containers. Place a container of rice and a chicken breast in a cooler with a piece of fruit, an individual container of cottage cheese and a protein bar and you've got several meals to eat on the go.  No time for breakfast in the morning? Cook up several days of steel-cut oats or cooked oatmeal and place in Ziploc containers. When mixed with cottage cheese, the oatmeal is great cold. Or try this novel idea?get up 20 minutes early and have a great breakfast of cooked eggs.  It's not easy, but you don't want to look like your peers, do you? It takes effort to have a legendary physique, and we are not looking to be like everyone else, we are looking for health, fitness, vitality, youthfulness and vibrancy.  Get your supplements in order! Our top three picks. Multi-vitamin Super-antioxidant Glutamine Want to take it a bit further? Vitamin C, E, B-complex Calcium One more step? BCAAs Creatine The list goes on and on with supplements. But, we are trying to give you an introductory sampling of possible supplements to add to your daily plan without overloading you. Depending upon the stresses you put on your body in terms of the intensity of your exercise programs will determine the levels of supplementation and the need for additional items not on the above list.  Everyone should check with their physician before adding supplements into their routine. This is critical for Baby boomers and all ages that are a bit overweight. Carrying excess pounds creates imbalances in the system, which makes it difficult for the body to metabolize the supplements properly. Diabetics should NOT use glutamine before checking with their physician and should check protein supplements carefully as many as now including glutamine.  Diane: Here's my glutamine tip. Since glutamine is a supplement that aids with recovery, I want it in my system at the moment I've completed my training session. So, I add a few grams of glutamine to my water bottle that I use during my cardio and resistance training sessions. And then post workout, I'll take a few more grams of glutamine. Try this method of supplementing with glutamine and let me know how it works for you.  Getting In Shape For This Summer Means Movement.  Let's start briefly with a discussion of cardiovascular exercise. Many more details will follow next week on cardio and resistance training.  If you need to shed bodyfat, you need to start moving. If you are brand new to exercise, start slow this week with walking, as walking is easy on the joints and can be done ANYWHERE! If you don't have a treadmill at home and it is cold and rainy where you live, hit the mall for a brisk 30-45 minute walk, five times this week. That's all you have to do. It's simple, it's free and doesn't require any equipment. For those of you lucky enough to live in warm climate get outside and go for a walk. Enjoy the outdoors!  Are you an intermediate or advanced level fitness buff that's already engaged in cardiovascular activity? Then try something new this week. If you are always strapped to a piece of equipment, get outdoors for a walk or bike ride. Go skiing or snowboarding in cold climates. Find an ice skating ring and really burn some calories. Movement is and can be fun, so go and enjoy.  Getting In Shape For This Summer Means Resistance Training!  Once again, much more on resistance training next time.  Are you brand new to weightlifting? Here are your assignments for the week Make the decision to join a gym or create a home gym Purchase your gym membership or equipment for home gym Hire a personal trainer for several sessions to learn about program design and the critical elements of proper technique Hit the bookstore.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babyboom28.htm,"Shaping Up For Summer, The Baby Boomer Way: Part 2!Click Here For Part One! Baby boomers! As promised, here's the second part of the Legendary Fitness plan to shape up for summer. Last week we focused on cleaning out the pantry, stocking up on nutrient dense foods, purchasing supplements and being prepared with protein bars and MRPs for times when a real meal is not possible. This week we turn our focus to the movement end of the Baby boomer shape up plan, cardiovascular exercise and resistance training.  ""Moving is fun,"" said Cat Smiley, Canadian Freestyle skier and host of the new radio talk show, Physically Tweaked, The Cat Smiley Show."" Diane: I had the good fortune to be a guest on this new fitness radio talk show where we talked about the current levels of obesity. So many people believe that cardiovascular activity is boring. But, it doesn't have to be. Just try skiing the Cat Smiley way, and you'll never again believe that cardio is boring. Cat's right! Movement is fun! Interested in hearing this fitness talk show? Check out, http://www.catsmiley.com/pages/635960/index.htm  Click To Enlarge! From skiing to blading, biking and tennis, dancing which served as John Grimek's cardiovascular exercise or running, you don't have to be tied to a piece of cardio equipment in the gym on a daily basis.  The point is to just start moving! How much movement you ask? Great question as this is an area of confusion.  Why is the amount of cardio needed so confusing? Because, there is so much conflicting information that it's hard to decide which advice to follow. The reason for the confusion is surprising, as the public is to blame for the differing information. In 1978 the American College of Sports Medicine recommended vigorous activity such as running, at least three times per week. But, recommendations were drastically scaled back in the 1990's when few were participating in rigorous activities that got their hearts revved up at least three times per week. As a result, intensity was replaced with moderation. Running and sprinting were replaced with brisk walking or gardening.  Boomers, we've discussed the physiological changes that occur after 40 in previous articles. One of the important factors is that the metabolism slows down after the age of 40. That means we need to either consume fewer calories or engage in activities where we burn more. If you want to have a legendary physique, you are going to have to work for it. Make it fun and it won't seem like work.  For all levels engaged in exercise activities, a proper warm-up is required. A moderate walk slowly increasing to a brisk walk for five to twenty minutes will do the trick. Use this walking warm-up before your cardio and resistance training.  Learning To Run. Beginner Cardio Routine Start by walking 3-5 times per week at a moderate pace At the end of the week, start increasing the speed or duration of the walk As your pace and endurance increase, begin interval training which is alternating between very fast and moderate levels of walking for a minute on, followed by a minute off Replace the fast walking with a slow jog and alternate between jogging and walking Increase the duration of the jog. Five minutes of jogging, followed by one minute of walking. Once again, increase the jog up to ten and then fifteen minutes. Reach twenty minutes of jogging and start interval training again, this time alternating between short bursts of running (faster than jogging) and a quick recovery jog. Increase the length of run time. You are now a runner! Some of you will progress through the stages quickly, while others will stay in each stage for several weeks. The point is to keep striving to make progress.  Some of you boomers are already suffering the wrath of Boomeritis with injuries that will not allow you to run. Follow the same routine with biking, working to increase speed, endurance or hill work, or if you must do your cardio in a gym use a recumbent bike or elliptical machine which tend to be easy on the joints.  Intermediate to advanced level running routine. Work to increase endurance by increasing the time of the run Add intensity to your running with interval training. Run sprints for 90 seconds, back off for 60-90 seconds at a moderate run and sprint again. 20-30 minutes of sprint intervals will increase your intensity and will burn many calories. Run sprints up a hill. Walk back down quickly. Boomers watch out for running downhill, as this can be hard on the knees. Intermediate and advanced runners already have their set number of running days per week. Try adding in variety with sprints, interval training or endurance running once per week.  Running can be hard on the knees so run on a track as often as possible. Also, replace your running shoes often. Check the inside of your shoes for wear, not just the outside. Running has wonderful benefits. It doesn't cost anything and provides an efficient means of burning many calories quickly. It also tends to remove the fat pockets from women's problem areas in the hips and thighs. Richard trained Laura Combes when she was crowned the first Ms. America. Running was a part of her routine to remove pockets of fat.  Getting In Shape For Summer Also Means Movement Through Resistance Training.  Beginning weight lifters had several tasks last week including the purchase of a gym membership or equipment for home use. You've done your warm-up and now it's time to begin with a simple circuit training routine. Use this routine for one to four weeks. You will do a full body workout, three times per week. Use fairly light weights so that you can get acclimated to lifting with proper technique and understand how to contract the working muscle, while relaxing others.  Diane: I can't stress enough, the importance of hiring a qualified trainer to teach you proper lifting techniques. Good form is important at all ages, but critical to us baby boomers that are struggling to remain injury free. Trust me on this one; some dollars spent now will save hundreds in medical deductibles later on.

Perform each exercise doing one set of 12-15 reps. If you are not too sore on Day Two, run through the circuit training routine a second time. Follow this advice on the third training day and you'll be running through this routine three times. When ready, it's time to move on to the intermediate routine.  Intermediate Resistance Training  Plan on four workout sessions per week, two for upper body and two for the lower body.

Day Five, repeat workout number one. Evaluate where you are in your periodization training and determine the intensity levels.  While training programs should be tailored towards individual needs, there are several key rules that should be followed by all lifters. Richard recently received an email that is full of questions many lifters share.  Question: 1. How do I increase my poundages?  2. When I try and lift heavy my form becomes bad, so how do I increase my poundages without compromising form.  3. Is it a better idea to lift a bit heavier weight and compromise on the form, or stick to a lower weight (which you have been doing for a couple of months).  4. If you do not increase your weight lifting capabilities, does this stunt muscle growth?  5. How often should one strive to lift heaver weights?  6. Is it a good idea help increase your poundage by taking help from the spotter right from the first rep?  7. How often should one switch between high wt/low rep and low wt/high rep, (is it necessary) or should one just stick to high weights?  I really hope you could help me with the above, as it has been affecting my workouts lately and was sure I could count on an experienced bodybuilder like you.  Tarun N. Answer:  Hi Tarun,  Progressive resistance is the premier principle in strength gains, yet each of us has different potentials. You should NEVER compromise form or you're setting yourself up for injury. You should NEVER (or rarely) do singles; they're just too dangerous, especially without an experienced spotter. The first thing you should do is pick a weight that you can do 6 or 8 repetitions with and work on doing more repetitions of that weight until you can do 10-12 repetitions with it.  Then you add weight until you are back down to 4-6 repetitions and work on doing more repetitions with that weight until you can do 10-12 repetitions with it, etc. You should progress on this simple scheme for years!  Spotters will only help if you only use them on the last repetition if you are lifting to momentary failure. They do no good if you're going to use them to lift the weight for you.  When you begin to experience sticking points here are several things you can do: 1) Take a short layoff and get lots of sleep and think about your diet; make sure you are providing your body with maximum recovery and nutrition and then come back to training with renewed enthusiasm.  2) Work in the power rack on the part of the motion that seems to stall (example: do partials by setting the pins so you are just working the portion of the lift that seems to be giving you problems).  3) Just do high reps (10-15) for a month or so to give your tendons and ligaments a break and build capillaries in the muscles and then go back to the heavier weights and lower reps You just can't keep gaining strength in a linear fashion forever. But these tips should help you achieve your potential.    Happy training,  Richard  For baby boomers of all levels trying to shape up for summer, you should have your training journals in place, logging workouts, cardio and nutrition on a daily basis. Whenever possible, log the information as it happens. It's so easy to forget that you had a MRP at 10 am when it's now twelve hours later.  Reading is motivational at all levels. As discussed last week, we are starting a book discussion group. Dave Draper's, Your Body Revival and Todor Bompa's, Serious Strength Training are our current picks for discussion in April.    Train hard, train smart and get in shape for summer!  Richard and Diane Last call!!! We've been hearing from you and are still gathering your thoughts and views on the current state of bodybuilding.

Baby Bumps And Barbells: How To Stay Fit When You're Pregnant
Assuming your doc gives you the green light, there’s no need to stop training and eating clean, healthy food when you’re pregnant. Here’s how.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/baby-bumps-and-barbells-how-to-stay-fit-when-pregnant.html,"Interest in the topic of weight gain during pregnancy has ballooned. On a recent pregnancy blog, I noticed many women supporting each other in their unhealthy cravings and overindulgences. In response to a picture of a heavy and pregnant Jessica Simpson, women wrote things like: ""If you are worried about your weight then, really, what kind of mother would you be?""""If you're craving something when you are pregnant, you should eat it because the baby wants it!""""It's the only time in a woman's life where weight gain is acceptable; you can wear elastic clothes while you grow!""As a personal trainer and fitness nutritionist, and as a woman who has very recently had a baby, this type of mentality saddens me. Throughout my pregnancy, I was eyed skeptically while I worked out. I heard, ""Don't you need to put on some weight?"" and, ""Aren't you over doing it?""I had to bring the woman who bore me to one of my doctor's appointments so she could hear for herself that my training and my healthy eating habits were not hurting her grandchild in the womb. Because I took such good care of my body, my journey through pregnancy was a breeze. I dodged symptoms that normally plague overweight and sedentary women. I sit here today, a week after giving birth, in my skinny jeans. I have six weeks of rest ahead of me, but I'm at peace with it because I feel phenomenal!There is little in the way of direction for pregnant women looking to stay fit. Most articles just throw in pictures of pregnant ladies holding a 5-pound dumbbell or smiling in yoga pants. There's a lot more to staying fit during pregnancy than just buying a mat a doing some stretches.I'd like to share my knowledge and experience to help pregnant women stay fit and healthy-you AND your baby will be better off with diet and exercise. We should approach these nine months of carrying another human being with more care and attention than we would at any other time! Training While Preggers If you would like to remain or begin working out during pregnancy, begin in the practitioner's office. Find out first what you are allowed to do. The most common restriction is keeping your heart rate down. My doctor told me to keep my heart rate below 140; that was problematic for me because I had to totally tone down my normal cardio routine. My running turned into trotting and became painfully boring. I was relieved when it came to my weight training because I could basically continue my normal routine. I just had to make a few tweaks: Grab dumbbells that you would normally use for a 12-15 rep range and use them for an 8-10 rep set. You're still lifting hard, but not getting your heart rate up too high for too long.After the first trimester, stay away from lying flat on your back whether you are doing abs or bench press. The uterus could potentially compress the vena cava, which may result in a reduced blood flow, leaving you dizzy or nauseated.Sometime during your pregnancy, Relaxin, a hormone that loosens ligaments to prepare your body for delivery, will kick in like a feisty fetus. When you feel it, back off your heavier or more difficult free-weight movements and drift more to the machines for more support and safety.Take your jogging cardio to the elliptical to prevent hip or knee pain.Listen to your body. Adjust your workout accordingly.Sample Workout    Day 1: Legs/Shoulders      Walking, Treadmill20 min on incline     Leg Extensions2 drop sets of 10,12,15 reps     Barbell Squat4 sets of 8-10 reps     Standing Leg Curl2 drop sets of 10,12,15 reps     Romanian Deadlift4 sets of 8-10 reps   Superset:   One Leg Barbell Squat3 sets of 12 reps     Barbell Lunge (Smith Machine)3 sets of 12 reps  Superset:   Arnold Dumbbell Press3 sets of 8-10 reps     Side Lateral Raise3 sets of 20 reps  Superset:   Smith Machine Overhead Shoulder Press3 sets of 8-10 reps     Side Lateral Raise3 sets of 20 reps  Superset:   Reverse Machine Flyes3 sets of 10-12 reps     Face Pull3 sets of 15 reps   quickstart_training_white(""Sample: Legs/Shoulders"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=Incline+walking,+treadmill:+20+min&Sets%5B%5D=1&Exercise%5B%5D=Leg+Extension:+2+drop+sets+of+10,12,15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Barbell+Squat:+4+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Standing+Leg+Curl:+2+drop+sets+of+10,12,15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Romanian+deadlift:+4+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=4&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Bulgarian+Squat:+3+sets+of+12+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Smith+Machine+Lunge:+3+sets+of+12+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Arnold+Press:+3+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Side+Lateral+Raise:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Smith+Machine+Overhead+Press:+3+sets+of+8-10+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Side+Lateral+Raise:+3+sets+of+20+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Superset:&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Reverse+Machine+Flyes:+3+sets+of+10-12+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&Exercise%5B%5D=Cable+Face+Pull:+3+sets+of+15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=3&TotalExercises=17&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=Abigail+Kluttz&name=Sample:+Legs/Shoulders"");Printable PagePDF DocumentEating While PreggersIt's a fact of creating new life: While you're pregnant, you're going to gain weight. Here's Why: on average, women gain 7.5 pounds for the baby, 1.5 pounds for the placenta, 2 pounds for the amniotic fluid, 2 pounds for uterine enlargement, 2 pounds for breast tissue, 2 pounds for blood volume, 4 pounds of fluid in maternal tissue, and 7 pounds of maternal fat stores for an average total of 30 pounds.To stay within that range, you're going to have to use some will-power and restriction. There's no need to satisfy every craving. If that were true, I would have spent my entire pregnancy eating Mexican food and frozen yogurt. Pregnancy does crazy things to your blood sugar, and it's your job to keep it regulated with healthy, clean foods, not Twinkies. Talk to your doctor about your healthy weight gain. Choose a diet plan that will ensure that you're getting the proper nutrients without empty calories:Keep your metabolism revved by eating every 2.5-3 hours. Take advantage of the thermogenic effect, meaning the energy you expend digesting food.Though protein powder labels may suggest not using protein while pregnant, my doctor said it hasn't been studied or tested thoroughly. I found that protein shakes were my best friend! They helped me through some first trimester morning sickness and supplemented my lifting with good calories and lean protein.The National Women's Center of Health recommends eating an extra 300 calories during the last 6 months of pregnancy. Don't add empty calories! Three hundred calories is a half cup of oatmeal and one scoop of protein powder, not an extra cheeseburger. While a clean, healthy diet is important, it's unhealthy to be on a calorie-deficit diet during pregnancy. I'm a 5'9"" figure competitor, and my clean eating plan comprised 2,000 calories per day: 185 carb grams, 170 protein grams and 62 essential fats grams. That might seem like a lot of food, but I was training and eating about 85% clean.Maintaining a good diet keeps your blood sugar from dropping and your waistline from getting bigger than it must. This will also put you on the right track for weight loss after your baby arrives. The healthier you are, the healthier your baby will be. My clean diet and exercise program helped me produce a 7-pound, 5-ounce baby. The chubby cheeks and rolls look amazing where they belong, on him, but not on the post-pregnancy mom!

Body Transformation: Melody Decena Wyatt Went From Baby Body To Hard Body!
Melody discovered the effectiveness of heavy lifting after giving birth to her daughter. See how she torched her baby fat and dominated her first competition in a ripped body!

After we walked through the gym doors, we went our separate ways. He hit the weight room and I continued to be a cardio bunny, which helped me progressively shed the baby weight. After a while, I felt thin and got bored of the same treadmill routine.When I saw Jamie Eason on Bodybuilding.com, I became inspired and intrigued by the fitness world. I told my boyfriend that I want a body like Jamie's and he explained that I wouldn't get it on the treadmill.I wanted to embark on a challenge that I'd never done. I desired to live my life with passion. I wanted to feel empowered and live a long, healthy life. I wanted to be an example of willpower to my daughter. I felt drawn in and excited. I knew this journey was meant to be, so I decided to run with it and gave it my all.

I was intrigued by the newfound lifestyle. The more knowledge I acquired the more motivated and determined I grew. I eliminated bread, sugars, alcohol, and fast food from my diet and started following Jamie Eason's meal plan. Instead of spending time on the treadmill, I headed for the weights with my man. He encouraged me, motivated me, and opened my eyes to the benefits of lifting heavy. I discovered that the cleaner I ate and the harder I trained, the better my progress was.Cool FactAs a food service specialist in the Army National Guard, Melody is  the only female in her unit that is airborne and air assault  qualified with record-breaking PT scores!When I had a taste of what my body was capable of, I decided to compete, so I picked a show and committed to it. Taking that step gave me the drive to push myself even harder. I wanted to be the best on stage and I refused to look like a fool. Committing to a competition was one of the best decisions I ever made. It helped me develop and strengthen my discipline and willpower.I look back and can't believe that I thought countless hours of cardio would help me obtain a dream body.

I had to build my strength and endurance. Last year, I could barely bench the bar or a pull-up. Be patient with your results, but push yourself without overdoing it.I always do an initial warm-up set with light weight on all exercises then do three working sets by increasing the weight for each set. I typically try to do 20-30 minutes of cardio every other day to get my blood pumping on the stairmaster, elliptical, incline treadmill, or stationary bike.

10 Baby Steps To Launch Your Motivation To Application!
Why do you want to exercise?  Is someone urging you to do so?  Do you want to do it for yourself?  Make sure you are working out because you want to. Here are ten baby steps to help you on your road to a healthier life. Try them now!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/10_motivation_baby_steps.htm,"Article Summary: Figure out why you want to change your life, and set up your goals. Design a workout program you'll like, and change it up if you don't. Gain support and knowledge from like-minded people.  1. Ask Yourself Why You Want To Do This  This is an important question and it needs to be asked first. Why do you want to exercise? Is someone urging you to do so? Do you want to do it for yourself? Make sure you are working out because you want to and not because someone wants you to.  Click To Enlarge.Why Do You Want To Exercise? If you aren't 100% committed to working out, you will be a portion of the 50% of people who stop exercising within the first 6 months of beginning a program.  2. Education  Read up on fitness and exercise. Grab some magazines and soak up as much knowledge as you can. You will find tons of articles on different workouts, diets, motivational tips, staying focused, and much more. Take that information and utilize it when you are making up your workout and diet plan.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ] In A Rut? Don't Just Sit There!   Some folks don't even realize they're in a rut, as they religiously plod along, training day after day, convinced that everything is fine... Well everything is not fine!   Author: Tim Wescott  When you find yourself in a rut or are lacking motivation, you can pull from the things you read and get yourself back on track. It's also important to learn a little about the human body and how it works. After all, wouldn't you want to know what's going on with your body when you exercise?  Learn how the body burns fat and what exercises work what muscles. Educating yourself about fitness will give you a greater appreciation of all the hard work you put in at the gym.  3. Join A Gym/Buy Equipment  Now that you have your plan in motion, it's time to figure out if you want to pay for a gym membership or build a home gym. Building a home gym makes fitting in a workout very convenient, but at the same time a lot of people blow it off because they are at home and are thinking about a million other things they need to be doing.  RELATED POLL Does Having A Home Gym Make You More Prone To Distraction Away From Exercise?  Yes. Maybe But The Convenience Is Worth The Risk. If You've Got Stuff At Home, It's Just As Hard To Hit The Gym. No If You're Commited Nothing Will Distract You.     If you decide to go with this option, start off with just the essentials such as some dumbbells, a bench, and a piece of cardio equipment. With a gym membership people see the money coming out of their account each month and feel obligated to go since they are paying for it. On the flip side, if you join a gym that is out of your way, then you might feel that you don't have enough time to drive over and still fit in everything you needed to get done during the day.  If you decide to go with the gym membership, be sure and find a location that is convenient to you and has all the amenities that you would want it to have. Read all the fine print before signing any paperwork to understand the terms and conditions of the contract.

Make sure each type of goal is obtainable and measurable. Your short term goals will lead you up to your long term goal. For instance, you could set a long term goal of losing 30 pounds in 6 months. You're short term goal could be to lose 5 pounds each month to obtain that.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Fail To Plan And You've Planned To Fail!

Author: Jamie Eason  By writing everything down you will have no excuse to get lazy. You have a document that you wrote stating your intentions and goals to achieve.

Set Up A Routine And Days To Exercise  Come up with a schedule and make sure you follow it. Schedule time to workout before or after work or even during lunch. Whatever you chose, make sure it fits into your schedule without being a huge inconvenience. If you can wake up an hour early to fit a workout in, then by all means do that.  If you don't mind giving up a lunch break to get in a quick cardio session or weights then go for it. Simply work it into your schedule and write down the days you want to do your weight training and/or cardio and stick with it. After no time you will get into the routine of doing it and you won't even need to write it down anymore.  BODYBUILDING.COM FORUM: SCHEDULE THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ] Busy Schedule...

Pick Things You Enjoy Doing  There are many different types of training styles and the great thing about it is that it gives you variety. If you don't like one training method, you always have another to try. And changing things up isn't always bad. It stimulates the muscles in ways that a previous workout didn't and can also help you break through a plateau.  If the treadmill isn't your thing then go for a jog in the park or in the woods if the outdoors is your thing. Into sports? Grab your friends and play a pick-up game of basketball or football. The key is to utilize things that you enjoy that you can use to your advantage to help you get in your workouts.  Click To Enlarge.Grab Your Friends And Play Some Basketball. 7. Create A Workout  Set up a workout program (or have a trainer do it for you) that fits your goals and what you want to achieve. Make sure you are hitting all muscle groups 1-3 times a week based on your goals. Just as important, make sure you have rest days in your routine to allow proper recovery from workouts.  You're workouts should take no more than 60 minutes and should flow. Have fun with your workout, if you are getting tired of the same routine or program then switch it up. Talk to a trainer and let him/her know what you enjoy doing and what you are looking for and allow them to use their expertise to create a customized program just for you.

BABY Steps To A Better Diet!
To achieve your goals in bodybuilding and/or fat loss, you must have a near perfect diet. Eating should be viewed as something that is not just a side part of bodybuilding, but a major part of it.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babystep.htm,"Make the change as easy on yourself as possible for success! Admit it. Yes, I am talking to you. Your diet is not perfect and if you are like most people, it is far from it. You know that cherry cheesecake that you ate right BEFORE dinner was not a good idea, but what else goes good with pizza and beer?  Diet is Very Important  To achieve your goals in bodybuilding and/or fat loss, you must have a near perfect diet. Eating should be viewed as something that is not just a side part of bodybuilding, but a major part of it. The truth is that you can't get half the results no matter what workout program you are following if your diet is a stinker. There are no two ways about it. Okay, so what do you do about it? Empty all your current food out of your cupboards and refrigerator into the trash and replace it with tofu? Don't worry, it does not have to be that hard. The easiest way to acheive your goal of perfect nutrition is to take BABY Steps. The main idea of BABY Steps is that you slowly replace the bad foods that you are currently eating with better foods. The change will be so small each week that you won't even notice it. All you will notice is the ripped abs and huge biceps that suddenly came out of hiding! Use BABY Steps Follow these example BABY Steps to get you started: Drink skim milk. Ugh! Skim milk is sick... right? If you are currently drinking whole or 2% milk, you probably think so. It is just too hard for you to drink white water. Understand that by drinking even 1/2% milk over skim milk gives the average person hundreds or thousands of extra grams of fat per year! This can add up to extra pounds of fat each year! It has to go somewhere... Make it easy on yourself. If you are drinking whole milk right now, immediately move down to 2% milk. The first week or so you may notice the taste difference a little, but your body and tastebuds will adapt. You will enjoy 2% just as much as you used to like whole milk. I promise you that this is true! Give it a chance for two weeks. After a few weeks or a month of 2% milk, switch to 1%. Wait until you are used to it, then change to 1/2% and then to skim milk. This little change in your diet can make a huge difference in your body in just a few months. Skim milk has all the same protein and vitamins as whole milk, but without the fat. Cut the sugar! Sugar is the evil nutrient just waiting to turn you into a fat blob. These days, there is no excuse to consume a large amount of sugar. With stevia, aspartame and all the other sugar substitutes that taste great and have been proven to be safe, you can still satisfy your sweet tooth. The main place that sugar is hiding is in soda. It is easy to get addicted to this stuff. Right now, make a vow that you will NEVER drink another regular soda again... no matter what! Switch to diet soda. ""But diet is so sick!"", you say. Just give it a few weeks. I used to say the same exact thing a year ago. I drank soda each and every meal and loved it. I switched to diet when my bloated stomach asked me to. It was not great at first, but at least it was better than water. After a few weeks, I HONESTLY could not tell the difference between regular and diet! My tastebuds adapted and I haven't had a regular coke since. I don't miss it or the sugar and calories at all. I saved myself at least 1000 calories per week just by making this small change in my diet. Once you are used to the changes you made above, it is time for the next step. Note: The next sentence may freak you out. Completely cut ALL pizza and burgers out of your diet. Okay... breathe. It is going to be okay. We can do this together. In fact, you should make a pact with one of your diet buddies that you will help the other stick to it. Pizza and burgers are just about the worst things you can eat. The problem is that they are SO convenient! On every corner there is a pizza or burger joint just a smell away. Studies have shown that one of the main reasons so many Americans are obese is because they constantly eat fast food. Cutting out all fast food would be ideal, but usually not practical on a quick lunch or dinner. There are healthier selections on the menu at most places. As long as you completely avoid pizza and burgers, you are on the right track. The cool thing about the human body is that it adapts quickly. You LEARN to crave fattening food like pizza and burgers. You can also UNLEARN it. After a few weeks without it, you won't miss it as much... then not at all. Ask any healthy bodybuilder. It's Easy and It Works These are just a few steps you can take. You know what bad foods you eat too much of that need to be slowly cut out. If cutting out a certain food is too hard, make a deal with yourself to only eat it once per week. Cheating is okay! In fact, it can help you stick to your diet in the long term. After a year of slowly cutting out and/or reducing the bad foods and replacing them with healthier ones, your diet will have made a 180 degree change... and you won't even have noticed it! So many people say that starting today, they are going to eat perfect. Almost always, they do pretty well for about a week and then give up. The change is too drastic and they can't do it. By following the BABY Steps plan, you will change your diet effortlessly and your body will thank you for it."

Knowing that she needed to lose weight and required help, Margaret entered a ""7 Month Work Out Program"" hosted by a local gym and sports program where she was given a free gym membership to Powerhouse Gym in Little Rock, Arkansas and personal training sessions with the gym owner, Jeff Lawrence.

Training    Circuit training in a 12 station circuit, 3 times per week initially did not produce enough of a restrictive caloric environment to result in weight loss on the scale.

Here's what Margaret has to say about her transformation.  ""I haven learned how to eat, exercise and take care of myself. I feel better than I ever have. I hope that I have encouraged others.

Karen Traded Baby Weight For Lifting Weights!
Karen didn't let the price of a big-box gym scare her off. She built a kettlebell gym in her garage and lost 100 pounds!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/karen-traded-baby-weight-for-lifting-weights,"Vital StatsName: Karen ConwayLocation: Menifee, CAStaying healthy wasn't difficult for Karen Conwayat least, not back when she was growing up in a family that made it a priority to make healthy choices. ""When I was living at home with my parents, we had balanced meals,"" she says. ""Fruits, veggies, proteinsI was very used to that."" Karen admits that her own snacking habits weren't always the best, but having healthy influences around her help curb cravings. ""Just by having fresh groceries available, I found myself reaching for fruits and veggies a lot of the time,"" she recalls.But when Karen went out on her own, she found the temptation of unhealthy food impossible to resist. She gained weight during college, and then more weight during her two pregnancies. Karen tipped the scale at 230 pounds before a realization hit her like an explosion: She was extremely unhappy and felt like she was trapped in someone else's body. Something had to change, but she was the only one who could make it happen. This is Karen's story. How did college kick off your weight gain? To be honest, it all boiled down to laziness. I had the dorm-food meal plan, and while the options weren't always the healthiest, there were still options. Nevertheless, I still went for the refined carbsthe pizza, french fries, and cereal. Add to that the late-night study sessions and alcohol, and it led to me treating my body very badly. By the time I graduated, I'd turned my ""freshman 15"" into the ""freshman 25."" Before 228 lbs.After 127 lbs.Age: 29  Height: 5'3""  Weight: 228 lbs.  Body Fat: 69%Age: 30  Height: 5'3""  Weight: 127 lbs.  Body Fat: 24.5% Did you exercise during your college years or afterward? I was completely sedentary in college. My ""workout"" consisted of walking around my college campus. I never visited the gym and wasn't into any sports. Then I maintained that excess 25 pounds for the next eight years. I had my first child and gained an additional 40 pounds, pushing me into the 200s. After my first child was born, I lost some weight, but baby number two quickly changed that. I gained nearly 60 poundswhen she was born, I weighed nearly 220 pounds.Lots of women gain some weight during pregnancy. Why did this hit you so hard? I think I took the idea of ""eating for two"" way too seriously. Today, after both my pregnancies, I know that you only need to eat an extra 300-500 calories a day, but I'd say I was consuming an extra 1,000-2,000 from bad food. I had a huge sweet tooth, and I just went for it with everything from chocolate ice cream to lemonade. With my second pregnancy, I was much more aware of how much weight I could gain, so I tried to be more healthy and active. I still gained during my second pregnancy. Looking back, I ""enjoyed"" my pregnancies a little too much. What was your turning point? The beginning date of my weight loss and fitness transformation was January 1, 2015, but losing weight wasn't my resolution per se. Many people reference some sort of ""aha"" moment they had when beginning their weight-loss or fitness journey, like seeing themselves in a picture or not being able to fit into clothing. For me, it really wasn't like that.I just remember being so angry with myself. I felt lost and trapped inside. I was trying to tell my husband that it felt like I was inside someone else's skinthat my outside was no longer me. I felt like I was wearing a mask. It was hard for my husband to understand, because he's one of those people who is over 6 feet tall, lean, and can eat whatever he wants. He didn't fully understand how I was feeling, which made it all the more frustrating. I was angry that I let it get to that place, and that I didn't stop and turn things around sooner. Why did you choose January 1 to begin your transformation? I definitely wasn't like, 'New Year, new me' or anything like that. It was a lot less ceremonious. I just thought I'd try making some changes for one day and see how it went. One day turned into two. That turned into a week, and then a month. I was tracking my diet on MyFitnessPal and seeing my streak add up, which was really motivating. It was so exciting to be able to tell my husband something like, ""Look, it's been 45 days!"" How has your husband helped along the way? He's been my biggest supporter. He constantly encourages me to do whatever it takes to be happy and healthy, and he even adjusted the way he cooks to fit my needs. He's not a runner, but when I was scared to do my first 5K, he signed up to do it with me. Through it all, he's always been by my side. How did you change your diet in the beginning? Initially, I just concentrated on cutting back to reasonable portions and figuring out what healthy portions of different foods actually look like. To be as accurate as possible, I bought a food scale and logged all my food into MyFitnessPal. As I went along, it started to click that eating healthier means eating more. I could eat a whole plate of broccoli instead of just a few crackers. It didn't take too long to learn that better choices sometimes meant more food, which meant feeling fuller. What does your diet look like now?           Meal 1 Whey protein 42 gPB2 Original 12 gFrozen banana 80 gEgg whites 52 gGrapefruit 1 (approx. 75 g)          Meal 2 Cottage cheese 60 gRaw carrots 100 gApple 1 (approx. 140 g)          Meal 3 Chicken breast 4 oz.Green beans 4 oz.Steamed cauliflower 100 gFrank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce 15 mLReduced-fat blue cheese crumbles 2 tbspGrapes 100 g          Meal 4 Buttered popcorn rice cake 2 cakesNonfat refried beans 2 oz.Salsa 2 tbsp          Meal 5 Power Crunch Protein Bar 1 barOrange 1 (approx. 130 g)Sugar-free Metamucil 12 gWhat supplements helped you along the way?    Upon waking/pre-workout Whey protein 42 gPre-workout 3/4-1 scoop  Post-workout L-Carnitine 1 servingPB2 powdered peanut butter 12 gWhen did you get serious about training? Exercise came into play a couple months after I changed my diet. I began by walking around my neighborhood pushing my giantand heavydouble stroller. It was hard, at first, but I really grew to look forward to getting out of the house, taking in the fresh air, and feeling a different sense of accomplishment that I hadn't known in so long. The first month I started walking, I lost an extra 10 pounds. It was nothing crazy or intensejust a 30- or 40-minute walk with the kids in their stroller. At that point, I was already losing about 10 pounds a month just from the changes in my diet, so I remember being blown away by how much more weight I lost with just a little bit of exercise. I was immediately motivated to start adding more exercise to my day. My enjoyment snowballed, and by the fourth month, I was waking up before dawn to make time to run before obligations took over. It became a priority, and I became addicted. As I continued to learn about running and fitness in general, I started cross-training. How did lifting become part of your routine? I had a Groupon for two months of sessions at a local gym, and since the gym was new, the group classes I was signing up for often turned out to be private lessons with me and the instructor. He helped me build a foundation by teaching me form and technique, and he really educated me a lot about kettlebells. When my Groupon ran out, I couldn't afford a gym membership, so I bought my own set of kettlebells and now I work out at home in a mini gym in our garage. What do your workouts look like now?

I binge-watched all of the kettlebell-exercise videos on the site.Once I saw all those videos, I started exploring the rest of the site.

Body Transformation: Kristin Bounced Back After Babies
Kristin was more determined than ever to ditch the post pregnancy weight and strut her stuff on stage. Read on to see how she not only competed but took 1st overall!

White  Email: drkwhite@comcast.net           Before:  Age: 28 Height: 5'4"" Weight: 133 lbs Body Fat: 18%    After:  Age: 28 Height: 5'4"" Weight: 132 lbs Body Fat: 8%  Why I Got StartedI have always been athletic and doing a figure competition has always been a goal for me. When I was pregnant with my second child, I decided that I was not going to be believe the ""hype"" that your body changes forever after having kids. I was determined to look better than ever after my second child, so I hired a trainer when I was 20 weeks pregnant, picked a show and went to work.   Oh, baby. How's this for a post-pregnancy body?How I Did ItSince I was pregnant when I began training, I made sure I had a trainer who knew how to work with expecting women. I followed a clean, healthy diet during the remainder of my pregnancy along with a weight training and cardio program. I was able to maintain a healthy pregnancy weight and preserve lean muscle in the process. After my son was born, I was able to start lifting heavier and doing more intense cardio which really helped to transform my body. Since I breastfed for the first 7 months I had to make sure to eat a super clean, but also a balanced diet. After I stopped breastfeeding I started my competition diet which consisted of high protein and carbohydrates with limited fat. I focused on heavy lifting, plyometrics, and high intensity interval training for my workouts. My first competition was in April 2011, just 9 months after my having my baby. I won my class and overall figure! I competed again in May 2011 and won overall figure in that show as well! I look forward to many more competitions in the future but I am enjoying my off-season to take time to work on my problem areas (abs and glutes - of course!) and spend time with my family.

Day 7: Rest Suggestions To OthersA lot of people think that bodybuilding/figure is a sport that is all about vanity. I have found this entire experience to be so amazing and I cannot think of any sport that requires 24/7 dedication like I have experienced. The friends that I have made and the people that I have met have been incredibly supportive and helpful. There is so much more to bodybuilding than what happens ""on stage."" That is a small part of the whole process.As a Sports Medicine Chiropractor I honestly and truly believe in nutrition and exercise as the foundation for overall health. I have had two amazing trainers (Jason Rulo during pregnancy and Autumn Edwards post-partum) who completely understand the physiology involved in nutrition and training.My biggest piece of advice for anyone getting into this sport is to find an expert who has experience and knowledge of the body. Too many women go on ""hard core"" diets and spend hours in the gym every day trying to be ""stage ready."" This will result in destroying the metabolism, the thyroid, and the self-esteem. There is no trophy or ""title"" in the world worth that!My experience has been nothing short of amazing! It was a lot of hard work, but I never felt that I compromised my health. My trainers always knew how to build my confidence, even when I had ""problem areas"" that needed attention (which clearly I did just having a second c-section!). They knew that this sport is just as much mental and physical and always worked to build my confidence which, in retrospect, helped my overall presentation onstage. I truly believe that in this sport, more than any other, you need a trainer who is experienced, knowledgeable, and most importantly is your biggest fan and cheerleader! I was blessed to have those people in my life and want nothing other than to be an inspiration to others.You Could Be Our Next Transformation Of The Week Male Transformations.

Baby Steps To A Better Body!
This is a short article on how to slowly work into living a healthier life and keeping fat off.  Read on to learn more...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/other32.htm,"Admit it. Yes, I am talking to you. Your diet is not perfect and if you are like most people, it is far from it. You know that cherry cheesecake that you ate right BEFORE dinner was not a good idea, but what else goes good with pizza and beer?   Diet Is Very Important   To achieve your goals in bodybuilding and/or fat loss, you must have a near perfect diet. Eating should be viewed as something that is not just a side part of bodybuilding, but a major part of it. The truth is that you can't get half the results no matter what workout program you are following if your diet is a stinker. There are no two ways about it.  Okay, so what do you do about it? Empty all your current food out of your cupboards and refrigerator into the trash and replace it with tofu? Don't worry, it does not have to be that hard. The easiest way to acheive your goal of perfect nutrition is to take BABY Steps.  The main idea of BABY Steps is that you slowly replace the bad foods that you are currently eating with better foods. The change will be so small each week that you won't even notice it. All you will notice is the ripped abs and huge biceps that suddenly came out of hiding!   BABY Steps   Follow these example BABY Steps to get you started:  Milk  Drink skim milk. Ugh! Skim milk is sick... right? If you are currently drinking whole or 2% milk, you probably think so. It is just too hard for you to drink white water. Understand that by drinking even 1/2% milk over skim milk gives the average person hundreds or thousands of extra grams of fat per year! This can add up to extra pounds of fat each year! It has to go somewhere...    Make it easy on yourself. If you are drinking whole milk right now, immediately move down to 2% milk. The first week or so you may notice the taste difference a little, but your body and tastebuds will adapt. You will enjoy 2% just as much as you used to like whole milk. I promise you that this is true! Give it a chance for two weeks.  After a few weeks or a month of 2% milk, switch to 1%. Wait until you are used to it, then change to 1/2% and then to skim milk. This little change in your diet can make a huge difference in your body in just a few months. Skim milk has all the same protein and vitamins as whole milk, but without the fat.  Sugar  Cut the sugar! Sugar is the evil nutrient just waiting to turn you into a fat blob. These days, there is no excuse to consume a large amount of sugar. With stevia, aspartame and all the other sugar substitutes that taste great and have been proven to be safe, you can still satisfy your sweet tooth.  The main place that sugar is hiding is in soda. It is easy to get addicted to this stuff. Right now, make a vow that you will NEVER drink another regular soda again...no matter what! Switch to diet soda. ""But diet is so sick!"", you say. Just give it a few weeks. I used to say the same exact thing a year ago. I drank soda each and every meal and loved it.    I switched to diet when my bloated stomach asked me to. It was not great at first, but at least it was better than water. After a few weeks, I honestly could not tell the difference between regular and diet! My tastebuds adapted and I haven't had a regular soda since. I don't miss it or the sugar and calories at all. I saved myself at least 1000 calories per week just by making this small change in my diet.  Pizza & Burgers  Once you are used to the changes you made above, it is time for the next step. Completely cut ALL pizza and burgers out of your diet.  Calculate your estimated daily calorie intake... Okay... breathe. It is going to be okay. We can do this together. In fact, you should make a pact with one of your diet buddies that you will help the other stick to it.  Pizza and burgers are just about the worst things you can eat. The problem is that they are SO convenient! On every corner there is a pizza or burger joint just a smell away. Studies have shown that one of the main reasons so many Americans are obese is because they constantly eat fast food.    Cutting out all fast food would be ideal, but usually not practical on a quick lunch or dinner. There are healthier selections on the menu at most places. As long as you completely avoid pizza and burgers, you are on the right track.  The cool thing about the human body is that it adapts quickly. You LEARN to crave fattening food like pizza and burgers. You can also UNLEARN it. After a few weeks without it, you won't miss it as much... then not at all. Ask any healthy bodybuilder. What Are Your Goals? >Lose Fat >Build Muscle >Improve Energy >Other    It's Easy & It Works   These are just a few steps you can take. You know what bad foods you eat too much of that need to be slowly cut out. If cutting out a certain food is too hard, make a deal with yourself to only eat it once per week. Cheating is okay! In fact, it can help you stick to your diet in the long term.  After a year of slowly cutting out and/or reducing the bad foods and replacing them with healthier ones, your diet will have made a 180 degree change... and you won't even have noticed it! So many people say that starting today, they are going to eat perfect. Almost always, they do pretty well for about a week and then give up. The change is too drastic and they can't do it. By following the BABY Steps plan, you will change your diet effortlessly and your body will thank you for it."

Beginning Weight Training For Baby Boomers!
So, what's a Baby boomer to do that wants to achieve a high physique goal at a gym that only employs young clip-board trainers?  Follow our Legendary Fitness advice to create your own legendary physique!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/babyboom56.htm,"Beginning Weight Training For Baby Boomers Many Baby Boomer readers contact us each week seeking information about designing a resistance training program that takes into account their special needs. Far too often, our readers are discouraged by twenty-something-year-old ""trainers"" with perfect physiques that have never experienced age-related metabolic slowdowns and/or injuries and impingements that are often part of daily life for those of us born before the 1960's.  So, what's a Baby boomer to do that wants to achieve a high physique goal at a gym that only employs young clip-board trainers? Follow our Legendary Fitness advice to create your own legendary physique!   Diane's Training Recommendations   Richard and I share many of the same beliefs about training and the aging process. We both acknowledge the need for increased recovery time and the need for periodization training to maximize growth while minimizing the risks of injury.    All About Recovery!  Below I will discuss some secrets that I use with my athletes. When talking about recovery from training and competition, there are basically 5 areas to focus on.  [ Click here to learn more. ] However, we each take a different approach to training a new client. With this in mind, we are each presenting our favorite beginning workout routine for a healthy, injury-free 40-year-old client. What Are Your Goals? >Lose Fat >Build Muslce >Improve Energy >Other  Most clients that are over the age of 40 are interested in adding muscle and losing weight. While it is very difficult for advanced level gym rats to achieve significant gains in muscle mass while losing weight, most beginners can achieve both goals at the same time.  Cardiovascular exercise will be utilized to burn calories, while the resistance training builds lean muscle mass which provides a natural boost to the metabolism.  My favorite beginning routine alternates three days of cardio with three days of resistance training each week to provide the beginning gym member with a balanced approach to physique transformation.  Beginners should set a goal of thirty minutes of cardiovascular exercise, three times per week. Add five minutes to your cardio routine each week, until you reach 45 minutes.  Treadmill walking, recumbent bikes, elliptical machines and outdoor biking are all great examples of cardiovascular exercise that will take you toward your physique goals. Changing your mode of cardio exercise each session helps relieve boredom and will be beneficial in achieving long-term goals.  Resistance training routines will be utilized on alternating days, working each body part once per week. This will allow plenty of time for recovery and eliminates the need to graduate from a circuit training routine to full-blown weight training.  In my favorite workout plan for beginners, you will be using primarily dumbbells and barbells, as they do not force the lifter into a predetermined range of motion that has been designed to fit the model physique used to design the machine. In essence, you'll learn to be a lifter at your very first training session!  Things To Know As A New Gym Member!  Please work with a nationally certified trainer to learn to properly execute the movements. The investment in a good trainer will help prevent training related injuries that like to find their way into a baby boomer body.   Diane was recently nominated to the National Board of Fitness Experts (www.NBFE.org) where she is involved in the design of the first National Board certification exams for personal trainers to create a national standard for trainers. Look for more information in an upcoming article that discusses hiring a qualified trainer, soon!   Do NOT be intimidated by advanced trainers. Everyone was a beginner at one time.

Day 6   30 Minutes Cardio    Brisk, Outdoor Walk   Richard's Training Recommendations   I actually start everyone, no matter what their age, on the same routine (unless, of course, I have to take into account injuries that need to be worked around). Before I begin to outline the beginning routine, let me point out some important first principles:   The first goal is to learn to perform the exercises in good form. If you ignore proper form, you may, no WILL, do damage to your muscles, tendons and ligaments.    The second goal is to overload your muscles without getting sore. It is my opinion that if you become very sore, you have done too much. Any time you do anything new, you will experience some soreness, but it should be minimal. Therefore, I always start my clients out extremely slowly the first three weeks. By twelve weeks, my clients are outperforming those who began by copying an advanced routine.  The third goal is to learn persistence. Do not get discouraged when the strength gains begin to slow down to an almost negligible degree. You must realize that those early strength gains on the bench press or barbell curls are not really strength gains. Your brain must develop the motor pathways to coordinate the action of stabilizer muscles, synergistic muscles, and the primary muscles necessary to move the weights in these strange, new paths.  As your brain learns to engage the proper muscles at the proper times to move the weights through those paths, it only appears that you are getting stronger. It is only after these skill patterns are established that true strength gains occur. This is only one of many reasons that you should NOT, under any circumstances, engage in any ""high intensity"" or ""heavy duty"" training. High intensity training is absolutely dangerous for the beginner.    Form For Fitness: Are You Using Proper Form?  What is the correct way to train, and how do you sort through so much information, some of it apparently conflicting? While it would be impossible to discuss all aspects of proper form for every possible exercise, this article will try to address...  [ Click here to learn more. ] I begin the first session by weighing, measuring, and photographing my clients. This provides baseline measurements and a visual record from which to determine progress.  Then I determine the clients strength level in any particular movement by determining the maximum amount of weight the client can lift for one repetition in each of the exercises; this is called the one-repetition maximum or 1-RM.  Since I am going to have them perform 10 repetitions of each exercise, I just take 75-80% of the 1-RM for each of the exercises to determine the beginning amount of weight to use.  I believe beginners should perform three full body workouts per week for the first three months. This provides frequent stimulation with adequate time for recuperation for maximum hypertrophy. The first week, then, consists of the following workout:   Week 1 Abs: Crunches 1-20 repetitions.   Quadriceps: 30? Leg extensions, 10 repetitions Leg Biceps: Leg curls, 10 repetitions Calves: Standing heel raises, 10 repetitions Back: Wide grip pull downs, 10 repetitions Chest: Bench press, 10 repetitions Shoulders: Dumbbell side raises, 10 repetitions Triceps: Pushdowns, 10 repetitions Biceps: Dumbbell Curls, 10 repetitions   Click here for printable workout log!   Weeks 2 & 3   For week two and three, I add one set of 10 repetitions, adding weight where possible.  On week four, I drop the sets to two per exercise and add an exercise so that the client is doing the following program:   Week 4 Abs: Crunches 1-20 repetitions.   Leg raises 1X10   Quadriceps:  30? Leg extensions, 2X10 Squats 2X 10  Leg Biceps:  Lying leg curls, 2X10  Seated leg curls 2X10  Calves:  Standing heel raises, 2X10 Seated heel raises, 2X10  Back:  Wide grip pull-downs, 2X10 Low cable rows, 2X10  Chest:  Bench press, 2X10 Pec dec, 2X10  Shoulders:  Dumbbell side raises, 2X10 Dumbbell presses, 2X10  Triceps:  Pushdowns, 2X10 Dumbbell French presses, 2X10  Biceps:  Barbell curls, 2X10 Dumbbell Curls, 2X10   Click here for printable workout log!   Weeks 5 & 6   Week 5 and 6 are the same: I just add a third set of 10 repetitions to each of these exercises.  The last three months of beginning training are devoted to increasing strength on each movement and attempting to adjust the rep schedule that fits the physiology of the client. The degree of concentration, dedication, persistence, and drive as well as their stated goals determine how I will move the client into an intermediate stage.  You may be saying, ""Wait a minute! There's no cardio here!"" Yep. People generally come to me to change the shape of their body and to get them into good exercise habits. Those two things are my first priority.  If I do suggest cardio, I let them pick the form it will take and advise them to begin with 15 minutes three times the first week alternating days of cardio with the resistance training so that they are not done on the same day.    CARDIOlternatives - Make Your Cardio Fun!  Cardio is not just about running and using cardio machines, it is about participating in ideas that get your heart rate up. Let me provide you with some CARDIOlternatives to enhance your cardio workouts.  [ Click here to learn more. ] I then have them add 15 or 20 minutes the second week so that they are doing 30-35 minutes three times a week. I will usually instruct females to begin cardio rather early on, because females have slower metabolisms than males and almost always need to do cardio to get rid of some of that fat.  The problem most of the people I train have is that they are usually either very busy students or professionals who have limited time to devote to training. It takes about 6 months to get people into the habit of working out so that it becomes as necessary to them as brushing their teeth.  Therefore, my main concern with beginners is getting them into a routine that will provide maximum results in as little time as possible. My goal is to motivate them to establish a new lifestyle that includes a healthier diet. Diet is MUCH more important than cardio for fat loss. Get the diet right and the fat will go.  It will go more quickly with cardio, but I've watched too many people stay fat while doing hours of exercise every day. My clients, therefore, immediately begin to keep a food journal in which they record EVERYTHING that goes down their throat except water.  I tell them NOT to change anything in their eating habits until after the first two weeks. After I study their eating patterns, I make the smallest changes I can that I think will lead to the fastest results.    The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective Nutritional Programs!  Take a look around the nutrition world. Confusing, isn't it? Dozens of nutrition experts are rising to prominence. Part of the problem is that much of the information hasn't reached the people who need it. Learn why...  [ Click here to learn more. ] I keep a journal of every exercise, set, rep, and weight as well as the weight training principles I explain each day and turn it over to the client at the end of the first 3 months.  By then my clients have become familiar with the basic principles of gaining and losing weight, building strength, proper form of the basic exercises that work the entire body, the basic terms of resistance training, and what to eat and not eat to contribute to building their own legendary physique.

A New Father's Guide To Fitness
Everyone's heard horror stories about the challenges of staying healthy and sane with a new baby in the house. Use this unique opportunity to take a systematic approach to the timeless challenges facing your fitness plans.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/a-new-fathers-guide-to-fitness.html,"Vital StatsName: Vince Del Monte Height: 6'0"" Weight: 205 lbs Occupation: WBFF professional fitness model, personal trainer, and author Website: vincedelmontefitness.com Facebook: vincedelmontelivelargetvYou may recognize this guy. He stumbles out of bed feeling as though he hasn't slept. That's because he hasn't. He doesn't have the time for a real breakfast so he hits the drive thru for a breakfast McFatty. By 3 p.m. he's ready to faceplant on his desk. Hoping for some energy, he resorts to a designer coffee or a cola from the vending machine.He plans to hit the gym after work, but by the time he leaves the office, he's exhausted and starving. His wife is just as exhausted, so he picks up some Chinese takeout and heads home. In the last two months, he hasn't had a shower that lasted more than five minutes or slept for more than four hours straight. He used to curl 80 pounds, but he's down to curling 10, for however many reps it takes to change a wet diaper.Yep, he's a new father. You may even be him. I had no intention of being him when my wife gave birth to our precious baby girl during a hot summer day last August. Nine months later, I can say I narrowly escaped being him, but only because I planned ahead, took some positive steps, and had a great deal of help with some of the biggest health and fitness challenges of my life.I learned a lot during the process, and I want to share what I've learned with anyone else who is expecting a new child, whether it's your first or your fourth.""Becoming a father is huge game-changer.""The Same ... But DifferentBecoming a father is huge game-changer. Life is no longer about Vince's workouts, Vince's food, Vince's business, Vince's movies, and Vince's trips. After having a baby, it's no longer about me at all.Becoming a father is incredibly challengingeven more so if you're also trying to gain or maintain lean muscle and eat healthfully. But despite what you'll hear from some people, being a new Dad doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your own health and physique. In fact, by incorporating these tips into your life, being a new Dad may be one of the best things that could happen to your fitness goals.Think of it this way: The challenges you faced before having a father are the same ones you'll face now: Sleep and stress, diet, focus, accountability and time. But you'll experience them in an entirely new way.Challenge 1 Sleep and StressShortly after my daughter was born, I had the Koenigsberg test done to check my adrenal gland function, because I was eating in a caloric deficit but couldn't lose any fat. I was exhausted and stressed, and it wasn't much of a surprise to learn that my adrenal function was at an all-time low.Vince DelMonte 5 Tips To Improve Your Sleep Quality Watch The Video - 6:17  Stress, lack of sleep, and the stress caused by lack of sleep will wreak havoc on your hormone levels and throw them completely out of whack. When that happens, you'll be fatigued, you'll start to gain fator just store fat like I wasbecause of high cortisol levels. Pretty quickly, you'll find your testosterone levels will be too low to continue adding muscle.This is the point in article where I'd usually tell you to sleep more. Unfortunately, in the first weeks or even months after the baby is born, sleep is going to be a prize, not a guarantee. You may be one of the lucky fathers whose baby starts sleeping through the night almost immediately, but the odds are that you'll be getting up at least once each night for a changing or feeding.Are My Hormones Trying to Tell Me Something?The adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, are one of the first bodily systems to respond to declining health, particularly in response to stress, lack of sleep, or insufficient nutrition.By measuring the chloride levels in your urine, the Koenigsburg Adrenal Test gives a window into how effectively your adrenals are producing the hormone aldosterone, which regulates the body's salt, potassium, and water balance. Alternately, you could get cortisol or androgen levels tested, either by blood or saliva, to see if you have a hormone imbalance or deficiency.Do this through your doctor's office (recommended) or by purchasing a direct-to-consumer test online. Expect to pay between $30 and $125 for a test.I don't consider letting my wife deal with the late nights on her own an option, and neither will you. Simply accept that you're going to have interrupted sleep and irregular sleep patterns for a while and try to counter it one of two ways:Going to bed earlierGetting up laterBecause I have a business to run, and because I like getting a jump on the day, I started going to bed earlier. In fact, I go to bed earlier now than I did when I was young enough to be told to go to bed. I'm in bed by 9:30 each night and wide awake at 6 a.m., and it's actually quite an empowering feeling. I can still get around eight hours of sleep, even if it isn't all at once.Because my body and my health are a priority, I'm fine with missing nights in front of the television or working late on projects. In the meantime, my adrenal glands are now functioning as they should and I have a lot more energy to devote to burning fat and gaining muscle.Challenge 2 DietEating a healthy diet and hitting all your macros is challenging at any time, but even more so when you have a new baby in the house. If your wife usually does most of the food shopping and cooking, she probably won't be able to take care of you to the degree she used to. She shouldn't be expected to either. Even if you normally share the kitchen duties, prep time is now at a premium and will be for quite a while, and it's so easy to fall into the trap of ordering out or nuking your meals. But this is a dangerous road to fat gain and poor health.One of the best things I've ever done for my body and my family was to spend a chunk of money on cooking lessons with a chef. I learned how to cook meals in bulk so I could always have healthy meals that taste good and cover all my macros. I have to say, I've cooked some seriously good food and the meals were easy-on-the wallet and 10 times more delicious than my old bodybuilding meals. Learning how to cook in bulk had such a huge impact on my energy, health, and body that I made it the focus of the latest season of my online series, Live Large TV. I'll share some of what I learned in my next article for Bodybuilding.com.Improving my kitchen skills rescued my health and restored my energy levels, but it also saved me a huge amount of time and money. Every day after I have my first meal and get my workout in, I set aside an hour to cook all of our meals for that day and sometimes the next. Believe me, you can cook up to a week's worth of food in about the same time you cook a days worth of food when life is really busy. Having nutrient-dense foods ready to eat at any given time is absolutely crucial if you want to avoid the fat gain and muscle stagnation typical to new fathers.""Improving my kitchen skills rescued my health and restored my energy levels, but it also saved me a huge amount of time and money.""Challenge 3 FocusStaying focused is a constant battle for some peopleeven before they introduce a family into the mix. For others, it's fairly easy because they're driven. But if you're a new father, you're going to have a lot of obstacles to staying focused on your personal physique goals. Things are chaotic at home even in the best of times, there's a lot more to do to keep everything functioning for your family, and you will be totally fascinated by this incredible new baby.I navigated these unpredictable circumstances by scripting my day. I have a set schedule that I follow every single day, where I perform the most important tasks first, before something else has a chance to get in the way.""I can't stress enough how essential it is to focus on the most important things first.""I can't stress enough how essential it is to focus on the most important things first. I need to work out, eat welland make sure my wife does tooand run my business, so those tasks are scheduled first. I get up at 7 a.m. or earlier, eat, and then work out from 8-9 a.m. From 9-10, I cook. From 10-4, I work. Then, 4-8 p.m. is for spending time with my wife and daughter and having a good dinner. Our daughter goes to bed at 8 p.m., which gives me an hour and a half to spend relaxing with my wife and doing something fun. I do my best not to go back to the computer in the evening unless there is an emergency that can't wait.Even if you normally hate having a set schedule, I can't recommend it enough. We have a limited amount of willpower, especially when we're tired and busier than usual. A lot of guys balk at following a schedule because they don't like being told what to do, but don't forget that you're the one creating the schedule, and it's our goals that the schedule was created to meet.Challenge 4 AccountabilityNeeding some extra accountability is nothing to be embarrassed about. Some people find they do better with accountability at all times, while other people just need it during particularly challenging times like after a birth. That accountability might be something as small as having a buddy at the gym to check your progress or run sprints with you, or it could be something you pay for. It only has to make sense to one person: You.I chose to hire renowned coach Ryan Faehnle to write my workouts and meal plans, eliminating all guess work and giving me a structured and progressive program to follow. I've never believed in being your own coach, because any time I've coached myself, I get sub-optimal results. Not only do I get to benefit from Ryan's incredible knowledge and unique techniques, but I get to hand over the reins to someone else so I can focus on my other responsibilities.""Not only do I get to benefit from Ryan's incredible knowledge and unique techniques, but I get to hand over the reins to someone else so I can focus on my other responsibilities.""I realize that not everyone can afford to hire a great coach, and I'm not saying you can't get results on your own. But I will say that you'll always get faster results if can find someone to help you stay accountable to your workouts and meals. Join a community, either locally or virtually. Partner up with a friend who's interested in working together. Enter a transformation contest with a deadline. Follow a program designed by someone you look up to, and don't be afraid to spend a few bucks on a program so that you put some money at stake.Challenge 5 TimeTimeyou used to have a lot of it. Now you don't. Even if your schedule seemed jammed before you had a newborn, now it's completely covered up. Aside from focusing on what's important and creating a schedule that reflects that, the best thing you can do for you and your family is to get some help.No matter how amazing your wife is, she's not Superwoman. Don't expect her to be able to take care of the baby and everything having to do with your home life as well. Your wife may be working outside the home as well, just as you are. Do whatever you can to help each other, but don't be afraid to accept help when it's there for the taking.""Aside from focusing on what's important and creating a schedule that reflects that, the best thing you can do for you and your family is to get some help.""Even if you can't afford to pay for a cleaning service or help with the yard or whatever else, maybe you can find ways to barter for it. If you're an accountant, maybe you know a guy who can maintain your yard in exchange for help with his taxes. Maybe your wife's a hairstylist and knows someone who would gladly clean one morning each week in exchange for free haircuts or color. You get the idea. Let the in-laws and your parents or friends help out when they offer. It's temporary, they'll love being able to spend time with your baby, and you'll preserve your health, sanity, and marriage along the way.I'll leave you with one last tip that has become my mantra every time the baby pushes us to our limits: ""This too shall pass, soon to be replaced by something else."" It's one of my favorite quotes and it's so appropriate to the first few months of raising a newborn. Take steps to make sure that you stay on track so you don't have to start from square one over and over again. Along the way, remember to cherish every single moment with your newborn.

Jordan Edwards' Secrets For Instagram-Worthy Abs
Cellucor athlete and fitness model Jordan Edwards shares the secrets of her insane ab development. Burn, baby, burn!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/jordan-edwards-secrets-for-instagram-worthy-abs.html,"Main Page | Ab Training Tips PDF | Offseason Abs | 5 Core Moves  Instagram-Worthy Abs | Redefine Your AbsVital StatsName: Jordan Edwards Occupation: Cellucor Ambassador and Fitness Model Website: jordankefit.comIt's not just Instagram #nofilter hype; Cellucor athlete and fitness model Jordan Edwards knows exactly what it takes to develop and maintain a photo-worthy set of abs. A former collegiate high jumper, she now spends her time helping others clear their own obstacles in their routines via her online training business. On a daily basis, she fields a number of questions from clients, the most frequent of which is, of course, ""How do I get abs like yours?""While the answer is layered, and of course includes plenty of discussion of diet, Edwards urges her clients to first explore one particular variable in their training setup: frequency.""I truly believe consistency is key with abs,"" she says. ""Most people train them once a week and get tired of it. However, in order to maintain a perfect six-pack, your abs should be trained at least three times a week, or every other weekday.""This doesn't mean falling into the trap of doing the same workout day after day. Edwards mixes it up with each workout, and the results speak for themselves. Here's how she achieves a new level of definition!Weight or No Weight? One of the most hotly debated topics pertaining to abdominal training is whether or not to use resistance. Some athletes swear by the judicious use of cables, medicine balls, and even machines to bring about the fine details in their abs. Edwards has used weights in the past, but today, she isn't so sure.""I don't typically like using resistance or weights for doing ab workouts, because I believe it makes my midsection look thicker and more muscular,"" she says. ""I like to do ab exercises on the floor, using strictly body weight, in order to really shred my midsection. Occasionally, I'll use a light load, as when doing hanging knee raises for obliques, but I avoid the heavier resistance, because my abs tend to take on a 'bigger' look."" Take it from the abdominal diva herself! If you're looking to bring out the muscular pop in your abs, spending some time working in moderate rep ranges with weighted movements can help. But when the goal changes to slimming your waistline and maintaining it, leave the heaviness for someone else. ""Women who just want that super flat, toned stomach may benefit more from doing movements with just their body weight.""Jordan Edwards' Abdominal Schedule""I like to split my ab workouts up in sections,"" she says. ""For instance, I'll emphasize the lower-ab region on Mondays with moves like hanging leg raises. Then, I'll hit oblique exercises on Wednesdays with exercises on the floor. Upper abs are on Fridays, and feature my favorite move, the decline-bench sit-up."" Dividing the work in this way allows Edwards to add volume to each area she's targeting. ""I usually do roughly 260 reps for abs in most workouts,"" she says. ""I train them until I simply can't take it anymore. This usually takes about 20 minutes.""Edwards' advanced workout consists of just one move, but follows a protocol of descending and ascending reps, which she says is killer. A good example is the hanging knee raise for lower abs. (Choose a challenging exercise but one that's not overly difficult.) She does 29 sets of the movement in this progression: set 1 is for 15 reps, then rest up to 30 seconds, then do a set for 14, alternating work:rest all the way down to 1 rep, then go back up to 15. In the video Edwards is shown doing the cable version for obliques and lower abs, which increases the level of difficulty.    Jordan Edwards' One-Move Ab Blitz  1  Hanging Leg Raise29 sets  Note: Start with 15 reps, rest 30 seconds, then 14, then 13, on down to 1 rep, then back up to 15. Advanced trainees can use cable-resisted knee raises for obliques or lower abs.               Alternate High-Rep PlanThe single-exercise approach isn't the only one Edwards favors in her ab training. Another rotates five exercises in a circuit (with very short rest periods) that's highly intense in which she completes almost 400 reps. A full 400 reps? How does she even count them? It's simple: Pick a few highly effective exercises, and use a rep scheme that allows you to rack up serious volume without doing serious math. ""My favorite technique that always gets my ab burning is a descending style of training,"" she says. ""I like to pick five different exercises and do them back to back for 30 reps. Then, I go back through all five exercises again for 25 reps, and then I end with 20 reps of all five back to back. The burn is intense!""     Jordan Edwards' Favorite Ab Workout  1  Toe Toucher1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec.   2  Decline Crunch1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec. Reach up toward the ceiling. If this movement is too difficult, break it into blocks of 10.   3 Hanging Leg Raise1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec. Do knee raises or sets of 10 if this is too difficult, or do the reverse crunch on the floor.  4  Dead Bug1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec.  5  Russian Twist1 set of 30 reps, rest 30 sec. Note: Do all exercises in order in circuit fashion, resting if necessary. Beginners can start with just 10 reps per move. More advanced trainees should do 30 reps of each movement, 25 on the second round, and 20 in the third.              ""I have been doing these same exercises for about eight years now, and my core is still going strong,"" Edwards says. ""I don't think doing new, tricky ab routines is the right way to go. I think the best way to shred your core is to go old school, grab a yoga mat, and do as many bodyweight reps as your core can take."" Here are her technique tips for these key moves: Toe toucher: ""The higher you reach the more you'll pull your shoulder blades off the floor. The lower abs get worked isometrically, so this is really a challenging movement, and the burn is intense.""Decline crunch: ""Don't put your hands behind your head; instead reach for the ceiling. Because it's so hard, you may have to break your reps into blocks of 10.""Hanging leg raise: ""Straightened legs are more difficult than the bent-knee version. Be sure tilt your pelvis toward your rib cage to target the lower region of your abs. That's an area most people find they need to work on.""Dead bug: ""I love dead bugs! Dead bugs give you the best burn, especially if you really focus on contracting the abs hard on each rep.""Russian twist: ""Don't do these with your feet anchored like shown in the photos. Raising your feet off the ground is more challenging; you'll have to maintain balance on your glutes.

Is Chocolate A Fit Or Fat Food?
We all know a diet of Butterfinger and Baby Ruth bars will make you pack on pounds, but is there a way to make chocolate work for you rather than against you? Science has the surprising answer.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/is-chocolate-a-fit-or-fat-food.html,"Halloween pumpkins, Santa Claus, Valentine's Day hearts, and the Easter Bunny: These festive symbols all have a common thread, or more accurately a common tastechocolate! I can't think of any other food that is associated with as many special events and celebrations as chocolate. It comes in every shape, is served world-round, and also targets some of the most fundamental human cravings. Fat? Check. Sugary carbs? Check. Energy? Bonus!As children, the rule of thumb when it came to chocolate was elation before hesitation. As adults the inverse is more often the case. That's because chocolate's hefty levels of calories, sugar, and fat have secured its position toward the top of the ""foods to avoid"" and ""special occasions only"" lists. This notion has been reinforced by countless dietary schemes that are more or less built around the old saying, ""If it tastes good, it must be bad for you. And if it tastes amazing, it must be even worse.""In recent years some amazing research has revealed that chocolateor at least its base ingredient, cacaomight work for you, not against, when it comes to achieving a fitter, healthier body.However, in recent years some amazing research has revealed that chocolateor at least its base ingredient, cacaomight work for you, not against, when it comes to achieving a fitter, healthier body. The powerful nutrients in this simple bean can help limit fat storage in the body, in addition to providing mood, circulatory, and cell protection benefits. And those are only the benefits we know about.The time has come for us to reclaim chocolate! Let's rethink its reputed sinfulness and explore the ways you can enjoy it without guilt.The Food of the GodsLong before jolly old Saint Nick and his reindeer, the Mayans and the Aztecs1 ruled the Americas. The reverence these civilizations had for chocolate went to a level that may seem extreme even to today's ardent chocoholics.The Aztecs used what they called ""the food of the gods"" as currency, and it was also the basis of what their leader Montezuma called ""the divine drink."" Only the upper crust was allowed to sample this heady concoction, which included roasted cacao beans, vanilla, and chili peppers.Despite the drink's bitter taste and cold, sludgy consistency, it was powerful stuff. The Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes noted that ""a cup of this precious drink permits a man to walk for a whole day without food.""2The Aztecs called it xocolatl, but since it could be the first sports drink, I like to call it ""Montezumade."" No matter what we call it, its spirit lives on in cacao's scientific name, Theobroma cacao, from the Greek words theo (god) and broma (drink).Cacao was brought back across the Atlantic in the 16th century, where it was sweetened and refined to match European tastes. The intercontinental fascinationand the refining and sweeteningcontinued escalating throughout the centuries into today's multibillion-dollar chocolate industry.Xocolatl, the ""Divine Drink"" of the Aztecs        Ingredientswater 2 3/4 cups of watergreen chili pepper 1 slicedcocoa powder 1/8  cupvanilla extract 1 tsp        DirectionsBoil chili in 3/4 cup water for 5-10 minutes. Strain out chilis, add in other 2 cups water, bring back to boil, whisking in vanilla as water heats up. Add in cocoa powder and continue whisking for 5 minutes. Let cool and serve. Just don't expect it to be sweet or particularly tasty!More Bliss, More Blood FlowMost people laugh when I tell them that chocolate is a fruit that grows on trees, but it's true! The cacao tree grows in tropical regions in Central and South Americas such as the Amazon and Orinoco river basins.The cacao fruit's pods contain seeds or ""beans"" that are rich in nutrients and fat. The seeds, when removed, can be ground into cocoa paste. It becomes cocoa powder once varying levels of the fatty cocoa butter are removed.Cocoa powder on its own is pretty acrid stuff, as are the raw cacao nibs that have begun showing up in health food stores in recent years. But it's still packed with remarkable nutrientsincluding a few you can feel working.One is theobromine, a type of kinder, gentler caffeine responsible for mild mental stimulatory properties, and which is also present to a lesser extent in some teas and in yerba mate.On the other side, cacao also contains the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is a precursor to the calming neurotransmitter serotonin; and anandamide, which is also known as the ""bliss molecule"" for its ability to promote relaxation.The counterbalancing outcome of these of nutrients is a relaxed energy sometimes referred to as the cacao ""buzz."" Researchers have been able to show a clear mood improvement in research studies wherein participants consumed a chocolate product.3-5However, many of those same study participants expressed feelings of guilt due the association between chocolate and unhealthiness. This buzz kill is unfortunate because cacao starts doing a lot of good once it's in your body.A Cardiovascular and Cellular Champion!A lot of the positive press about chocolate in recent years has revolved around a class of nutrients called flavonoids, which it contains in spades. These fascinating plant products are renowned for the positive effects they can have on circulation and cardiovascular health.In a few prominent studies over the last decade, flavonoids from cacao have been shown to support the mechanics of optimal blood flow as well as desirable blood pressure and cholesterol levels.2,6-9 One study showed that just two weeks of including dark chocolate in the diet increased the potential for additional blood flow that could be accessed when necessary.9 And as anyone who has heard of ""blood doping"" knows, having more blood to deliver to muscle during and after exercise can translate to optimized performance and recovery.How does this work? Well, for one, cacao is rich in arginine, the amino acid that is the immediate precursor to nitric oxide. And nitric oxide, you may have heard, is a key regulator of blood flow that works by increasing the diameter of blood vessels supplying body tissueincluding muscle.8 Chocolate also seems to have a say in how much nitric oxide is made and how long it lasts in tissue. And, let's not forget that regular dark chocolate consumption also has been clearly linked to lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels, despite the saturated fat it contains.15-16Cacao is also packed with antioxidants, including but not limited to the famous flavonoids. Antioxidants are critical for hard-training people who burn more calories, and thus produce more free radicals in their bodies.Researchers at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom saw this in action in 2011 when they analyzed cyclists who consumed dark chocolate regularly for two weeks prior to a strenuous ride.10 While the dark chocolate didn't appear to increase performance, it did reduce markers of inflammation during recovery. Other researchers have noted that a couple weeks of dark chocolate consumption likewise improved markers of inflammation in non-athletic women.11Unfortunately, it's not clear at present to what extent we can expand these conclusions to muscle damage and recovery after resistance training. This is certainly an important area waiting for exploration. But the overall health benefits from cacao are increasingly clear.Chocolate for a Leaner, Healthier Body?As the dots pile up in the ""pro-choco"" column, you may be tempted to think purely in terms of math: ""Do the overall benefits of eating chocolate outweigh the caloric cost?"" Unfortunately, there's no simple way to answer that question, because those fantastic flavonoids do more than help your heart. They might also help to keep you lean!12One study, for instance, concluded that cacao components can reduce the efficiency of carbohydrate- and fat-digesting enzymes, which could benefit body weight management.13 Other research suggests that cacao nutrients might also work at the genetic level, reducing the activity of genes that produce proteins which increase fat storage.14Interestingly, in the cycling study mentioned above, the researchers also noted that the levels of fatty acids in the blood increased during cycling, which suggests greater release from fat tissue.10 This is promising, but cocoa and fat-loss connections are another area that could use further research and will no doubt get it.Get Your Square A Day!In case you haven't figured it out already, I firmly believe that chocolate and fitness can coexist  with a caveat: The health benefits from chocolate come from the cacao part, not from the additives that the Willy Wonkas of the world use to make it sweeter, creamier, and subsequently lighter product known as cocoa. So think in terms of ""cacao,"" not ""chocolate.""In general, choose products greater than 70 percent cacao, which is dark but still sweet enough to be appetizing for most people.When choosing chocolate, read labels. Look for darker, lower-fat, and lower-sugar varieties, and in particular, the products that clearly call out the percentage of cacao. In general, choose products greater than 70 percent cacao, which is dark but still sweet enough to be appetizing for most people. Shoot for 1.5-2.0 oz. of dark chocolate, which will deliver the level of flavonoids determined in several studies to support cardiovascular benefits.Most people find they can't eat dark chocolate in the same quantities as milk chocolate, but it's nevertheless important to keep in mind that even at that high of level of cacao, you will still get calories from fats and carbohydrates. The amount is roughly 200 calories per 1.5 oz., depending on the manufacturer.However, much of this will occur naturally, coming from the cacao itself. A milk chocolate product containing about the same calorie level may have double the sugar (24g versus 12g) of dark chocolate, and only one quarter of the fiber content.So be selective and be restrained. But don't beware, because chocolate is good for you.Dymatize NutritionOffering a variety of sports nutrition supplements designed to meet and exceed your fitness goals.Go Now!ReferencesHurst WJ, Tarka SM Jr, Powis TG, Valdez F Jr, Hester TR.

Armed Anarchy: Extreme Muscle-Building Arm Workout
Wage war against your tiny biceps and baby triceps. These 8 arm-training tips and extreme muscle-building workout are just what you need for extreme growth!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/armed-anarchy-extreme-muscle-building-arm-workout.html,"There's no better feeling than a pump in your biceps and triceps. It's true: 9 out of 10 broscientists agree that the pump is an addictive, ultra-necessary part of any arm workout. The pump has also been gym-clinically proven to boost confidence, support muscle growth, and keep you coming back for more gains-inducing punishment. If your workout hasn't been providing you the pump your arms need, or the size and shape you've been expecting, it's probably time to reassess your biceps and triceps workout and how you perform it. MuscleTech athlete and bodybuilding competitor Jesse Hobbs wants to help you do it. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out or have been in the gym for a couple of yearsfollow his eight bits of biceps-building and triceps-training advice, implement his workout, and you'll have the powerful, defined arms you've always wanted. 1 Arm your split ""One of the best ways to put on size is to hit your arms with more volume. I have a chest and triceps day, a back and biceps day, and then three days later, I hit the gym for a biceps and triceps workout,"" says Hobbs.This split works well, because when you hit your biceps and triceps with dedicated work, they'll be prefatigued from your back and chest work earlier in the week. When you get a chance to crush them, you can bring them to the state of full fatigue needed for massive growth. ""Increasing the blood flow to the muscles several times per week has really helped increase the size of my arms,"" explains HobbsHaving a workout that focuses exclusively on your arms after a few days of rest will help you feel fresh when you lift. Having lots of energy will allow you to lift maximal weight, which can increase the size and strength of your arms. A workout setup like this can really help you crack the next level of arm growth, so consider training your arms with a dedicated day and on days when you target larger body parts. 2 Recover for growth Even though more volume can lead to increased growth, don't get caught training your arms every day. Rest and recovery are essential for continued gains. You break down muscle in the gym, but you build it at rest with proper nutrition.""Getting sufficient rest for your arms is key,"" adds Hobbs. ""You utilize your arms in almost every lift in the gym, so it's important to give them a break between big body parts and dedicated sessions.""3 Supp wisely Hobbs also credits the supplements he uses for his success in the gym. ""I've seen great results from using Anarchy for my pre-workout supplement, Amino Build for my post-workout supplement, and NITRO-TECH for extra protein,"" he says.  Hobbs also credits the supplements he uses for his success in the gym. Pre-workouts are designed to help boost your energy, increase your blood flow, and push you to peak performance during each and every workout. Post-workouts give you a shot of the nutrients you need to grow immediately after training, and protein is absolutely essential for tissue growth and repair. While these supplements will never do all the work for you, they can help boost your energy levels, support blood and nutrient flow to the muscles, and help the muscle recovery process. Having a little assistance from supplements could mean faster results. 4 Controlled chaos Muscle growth comes from proper form and control, not necessarily super-heavy weight. To build great-looking arms, doing the exercises correctly is much more important than using as much weight as you can. ""It's critical to never swing your body into a curl,"" says Hobbs. ""If that happens, it's a sure sign you're using too much weight.""The minute you start swinging the weight during a curl is the minute you take the tension off your biceps. Constant tension on your muscles is what's going to make them grow. If you use other body parts or momentum to move heavy weight, your biceps workout will become less effective and you may also set yourself up for injury.""Keep your shoulder locked into place as you do a curl,"" says Hobbs. ""This should help you focus on moving only your elbow.""MuscleTech AnarchyExplosive pre-workout concentrate designed to enhance muscle strength and power!Go Now!5 Mind your elbows Building on the point above, your elbows drive every biceps and triceps movement. Your biceps flex the elbow, and the triceps extend it. So, think about your elbow positioning for every biceps and triceps movement you perform. Notice how your elbow positioning can impact how the exercises feel and how much weight you can use. Poor elbow positioning can cause discomfort and even injury. Mind the cardinal rule of training: If it hurts, don't do it. If it doesn't hurt, look for the best way to do it. In this case, the best elbow positions are those that allow you to feel maximum tension on your working muscles. ""When performing concentration curls, I like to keep my elbows pointed inward,"" says Hobbs. ""Using a preacher bench can help you maintain good form [and] keep your biceps working the entire time.""'6 Maintain constant tension To get the most out of each exercise, try to keep your muscles under tension throughout the range of motion. For the majority of exercises, your muscle gets to rest at the very bottom and very top of the movement. Shorten the range of motion just a little to maintain constant tension. ""For example,"" says Hobbs, ""the lowest point in a dip should be 45 degrees. At this point, you'll get a nice chest and delt stretch while maintaining constant tension on the triceps. At the top, don't lock out so much that your delts take all the stress off the triceps. Keep a slight bend so your triceps start to feel the burn!""  To get the most out of each exercise, try to keep your muscles under tension throughout the range of motion. You can utilize this same concept when performing triceps pull-downs. ""At the top, your arms should be at a 45-degree angle with your elbows bent,"" says Hobbs. ""Don't bring your arms up any farther than this, or you'll lose tension.""You may notice that your muscles fatigue more quickly when you keep them under constant tension. When that happens, you may need to use less weight in order to maintain good form and control. 7 Hold the squeeze Increase your pump, time under tension, and work performed by holding the peak contraction of every rep for a beat before releasing. ""At the end of triceps pull-downs, I like to roll the bottom of the ropes outward to get that extra bit of squeeze,"" explains Hobbs. Hobbs also recommends ""negative holds,"" in which you have a partner help you move a heavier-than-normal weight, then squeeze your working muscle at the peak contraction. ""Negative holds can also be a great way get deep into the muscle tissue,"" Hobbs says. He also suggests turning your pinky out and squeezing your biceps as you reach the end of a biceps curl. Doing so will help refine your biceps peak so you can get that baseball look.8 Finish strong If you're doing a long, tough workout, it's easy to lose focus by the end. To ensure that your mind and your body are working hard throughout your time in the gym, you may want to implement a tough workout finisher. ""I like to end my arms workout with a devastating triset finisher,"" says Hobbs. ""It's great for shoving even more blood into your triceps to help induce the greatest possible growth.""A finisher also gives you something to look forward to when you begin to lose focus. Try Hobbs's favorite arm workoutincluding his devastating trisetnext time you hit the gym!

Postnatal Ab Training: Fit Mommy Core Circuit
Every new mom wants to get her pre-baby body back. But a lot of women make the mistake of training improperly. Here's the info and workout you need!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/post-natal-ab-training-fit-mommy-core-circuit.html,"The most common question we get asked as postnatal trainers is: ""How do I get my tummy back to normal after giving birth?"" If you want your pre-baby body back or even better than it was, we can help.During pregnancy, women become athletes, if they weren't already. We have up to 50 percent more blood, which increases oxygen uptake so we can create another human being inside us! This alone is incredible. Combine that with what the female body goes through during labor, and we become full-blown superheroes. New moms are extraordinarily strong and well-positioned to regain their shape after giving birth.After nine months of extreme change around the midsection, the most important thing you can do post-partum is to start strengthening the core muscles. The best way to do it is to use a corrective exercise program that enables the body to heal from the inside out, building stability, strength, and muscle endurance. The internal abdominals need time and care to return to their pre-pregnancy condition, so hitting 100 crunches a day in a bid for a flat tummy can potentially cause more damage.Instead, start with the basics.Tummy Check  /// Your first step should be to check for abdominal separation. Why? This could potentially stop you from healing properly and enabling your abdominals to regain their former strength and shape.Some women have what they call the ""pooch"" under the belly button. In many cases, this is caused by the abdominal separation that wasn't addressed before they began a postnatal exercise regime.Here's how to do it:Rec CheckWatch The Video - 01:33   Lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet on the floor.Place one hand behind your head and the other hand on your abdomen, with your fingertips across your midlineparallel with your waistlineat the level of your belly button.With your abdominal wall relaxed, gently press your fingertips into your abdomen.Roll your upper body off the floor into a ""crunch,"" making sure that your ribcage moves closer to your pelvis.Move your fingertips back and forth across your midline, feeling for the right and left sides of your rectus abdominis muscle. Test for separation at, above, and below your belly button, measuring by fingers width.If you have more than a three-finger separation between your abs, seek advice from your health care professional before beginning a program.Post-Preggo Conditioning Circuit  /// Below is a six-exercise core conditioning circuit designed to help you heal from the inside out, reduce your separation, and achieve the ultimate flat tummy. In advance of starting the program, please receive consent from your health care professional to return to exercise.To do this circuit, you'll work for 40 seconds and rest for 20 for all six exercises. Complete the entire circuit two times through. Try to do it 3-4 times per week.1 / Mini CrunchThis is not a crunch. To do it properly, lie down on your back, then try to lift your head and shoulder blades off the ground. Keep your head tucked. Your hands should be sliding along the ground to your feet or behind your head. This is a very small movement; you should be aiming to produce a large contraction in your abdominals. Hold for 5-10 seconds before lowering back down in a controlled manner, then repeat.2 / Beginner PlankBegin lying face down on the floor. Prop yourself up on your knees and elbows. Position your elbows so they're directly underneath the shoulder and maintain a straight posture from the heel through to the shoulders. Hold for the duration of the interval and concentrate on engaging the transverse abdominus.3 / Heel SlidesThere are three parts to this exercise. First, lie on your back with your knees bent. Slowly let your right knee move to the right, keeping your low back and pelvis level. Return to the center and repeat with the left.Then, slide the right foot along the floor, straightening the knee. Slide the foot back toward the hip, and repeat with the left. Be sure that the floor supports the weight of the leg and that the foot does not lift off of the floor.Finally, lift the right foot off the floor, keeping the knee bent. Don't hold your breath and don't bulge your lower abdomen. Return the foot to the floor and repeat with the left foot. Focus on your breathing: Inhale when you lift and exhale to rest or hold.4 / Seated Knee Abduction with BandSit on an exercise ball or a chair and bring your knees together. Tie a resistance band around your knees. Press the legs outward against the band as you perform the hold and activate the pelvic floor muscles. Set a comfortable rhythm for the duration of the interval.5 / Kneeling Scapula Retraction with BandGet on your knees and hold the resistance band out in front of you. Put tension on the band by making sure your hands are slightly wider than shoulder-width. Slightly bend your elbows. Pinch your shoulder blades together until your forearms are perpendicular to your body. Release and then repeat. For this movement, make sure you activate your abdominals and your pelvic floor.6 / SquatStand with feet shoulder-width apart. Initiate the movement by pushing your hips back and down until they reach knee level. Keep your weight in your heels and your lower back flat. To return to the start, push through the heels and stand up. Exhale as you come back up. While doing this movement, keep your abs engaged.// <![CDATA[quickstart_training_white(""Fit Mommy Core Circuit"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=Circuit:+2+rounds&Sets%5B%5D=0&Exercise%5B%5D=Mini+Crunch:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Beginner+Plank:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Heel+Slides:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Seated+Knee+Abduction+with+Band:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Kneeling+Scapula+Retraction+with+Band:+40+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&Exercise%5B%5D=Squat:+40+seconds,+rest+20+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=2&TotalExercises=7&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=&name=Fit+Mommy+Core+Circuit"");// ]]>Printable PagePDF Document For more information and free post-natal fitness gifts visit Fitmummymanual.com!// <![CDATA[var addthis_config = {data_use_flash: false}// ]]>"

Physical and Health Education, University of Toronto  Occupation: Founder of CircuitFIT, Co-founder of PharmaFreak and SD Pharmaceuticals  Website(s): pharmafreak.com;  circuitfit.com; sdpharmaceuticals.comWide, ripped, thick, and freaky-strong is how most fit fanatics would describe their dream back. A super V-taper that makes your waist look tiny is priceless, but it's no easy feat! The back is a large body part, so it requires a lot of energy, intensity, and proper planning to build a routine that generates great results. Luckily, I'm a master planner.So many different movements can build your back. Barbell rows, cable rows, deadlifts, and chin-ups come to mind, and that's just scratching the surface. Where do you start, and what do you prioritize? This article will detail five top-notch back exercises you don't want to miss. Mix them into your routine to switch things up and keep your muscles guessing!5 Must-Do Back Moves! Watch The Video - 04:28 Look BackBefore you hit the gym and attack your back, you need to know the muscles you are targeting. Let's check out the functions of the major muscle groups of the back: the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, erector spinae, teres major, and rhomboids.Muscle and FunctionMuscle: Latissimus Dorsi, a.k.a. ""lats""  Function: Pull the arm down toward pelvis; pull body up toward armMuscle: Trapezius, a.k.a. ""traps""  Function: Scapular elevation, adduction, and depressionMuscle: Erector Spinae  Function: Extend and support spineMuscle: Teres Major  Function: Move humerus posteriorlyMuscle: Rhomboids  Function: Bring scapula toward spinal columnCool FactBACK FACT: The latissimus dorsi muscle attaches along the spine  from the ribcage all the way down to the hipbones. In other words,  it runs all the way down your back! It connects to the humerus bone along the underside of the upper arm.Must-Do Movements1 Chin-Up 21sTransform your basic chins into super chins that force your back to grow! The 21s technique will increase your muscles' time under tension while targeting three different ranges of motion.This creates a fuller and wider V-taper by developing the lats as well as the overall back musculature. Use a pronated (overhand) grip to target more lats and less biceps.Bottom Position - Middle Position - Top PositionExecutionTake hold of a chin-up bar with a wide, overhand grip.Start from the bottom position with a full stretch in your back.Perform 7 reps from the bottom to the midpoint of the exercise.Perform 7 reps from the midpoint to the top of the exercise.Perform the last 7 reps with a full range of motion. Pull your body up to the top by pulling your shoulder blades together and down. Slowly resist your bodyweight as you descend to the starting position.TipPull your shoulder blades together and down as you lift yourself up. Use a spotter or the chin-assist machine if necessary.2 Barbell Rack RowsWe're going to start these rows from a dead stop off the rack, which breaks the concentric and eccentric phase of the exercise and forces you to recruit more muscle fibers for greater power, development, and growth. This technique will also boost your back thickness.Barbell Rack RowsExecutionLoad the bar at mid-shin height on a rack and take a shoulder-width grip.Pull the bar up toward your ribcage in a dynamic and explosive manner. Resist the weight back onto the rack.Pause on the rack for a second or two to release back tension, then repeat for reps.VariationFor an added challenge, add chains to each side of the bar to alter the strength curve and add progressive resistance through the pulling phase.3 Blackburn Back ExtensionThis exercise increases the strength and stability of your back musculature while targeting the entire posterior chain. It improves posterior chain muscle balance and strength, which translates to injury prevention and stronger compound lifts like squats, rows, presses, and deadlifts.Blackburn Back ExtensionExecutionGet set on an isometric back extension. Hold your upper body in line with your legs.Start with your arms overhead and your thumbs pointed up. Switch your arms out to the sides with your thumbs up. Your arms should now be perpendicular to your body.Bend your elbows at a 90-degree angle and externally rotate your shoulders.Finish by moving your arms to your sides and turn your palms up to the ceiling. Hold each position for 3-5 seconds and focus on retracting your shoulder blades.VariationAdd weights to increase the demand on the stabilizers and the entire posterior chain.4 Alternating Kettlebell RowsTargeting one side of your back at a time improves balance and development. The dynamic aspect of alternating rows also requires more energy and develops overall back and pulling power.This move shocks the back and offers a different challenge than traditional dumbbells. It improves functional power and grip strength, which is especially useful for sport-specific conditioning.Alternating Kettlebell RowsExecutionGrab a pair of heavy kettlebells and, with your knees slightly bent, hinge from the hips.Brace your core and keep your back flat.Pull one kettlebell up to your armpit and twist through your obliques as you bring your elbow up and past your torso.Row to the opposite side and keep the exercise moving with a dynamic and continuous tempo.VariationTurn this into a more isolated exercise by doing these face down on an incline bench.5 Straight-Arm Pull-downThis exercise isolates the lats with a controlled movement. We're going to use a rope attachment to create an even greater range of motion.Straight-arm pull-downs let you target the lats without the interference of secondary muscles. This is a great finishing exercise to build the mind-muscle connection.ExecutionTake hold of a rope attachment and step a few feet away from a cable machine.With your feet shoulder-width apart and your chest open, pull from the shoulder joint with straight arms by contracting your lats.Bring the rope as far down as possible outside of your hips.Squeeze and slowly return the rope to eye level.VariationFor an added challenge, grab both ends of the rope with one hand and isolate each side with a one-arm pull-down."

Holly Powell Interview!
As a trainer and nutritionist, one of the dilemmas I face is convincing other mothers that they can get themselves into incredible shape regardless. This month I introduce to you, Holly Powell - mother, athlete and inspiration!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kristin2.htm,"Holly Powell is an inspiration. I recently had the privilege to meet Holly and become good friends at the most recent NPC Figure National event in New York City. What I found to be most incredible about this beautiful athlete from Columbus, Ohio is that she is a mother and did not begin her competitive career until after giving birth to her son.  As a trainer and nutritionist, one of the dilemmas I face is convincing other mothers that they can get themselves into incredible shape regardless. This month I introduce to you, Holly Powell - mother, athlete and inspiration!  The Interview   Kristin Reisinger: Please tell me a little bit about your background: age, athletic background, childhood, etc. Anything you might feel is pertinent to where you are now in terms of fitness and competition.  Holly Powell: I am 31 years old and have always been an active person ever since childhood. I never really competed in any sports because my family moved around all the time. I never went to the same school for more than 2 years until high school. When I say I always kept active, I mean, I never liked just sitting around. I was always outside playing, riding my bike, roller skating keeping busy. I'm that way as an adult too. However, I did attempt track (the 400m) my freshman year of high school. I wasn't very good so that was the only year I tried. I didn't push myself and really had no support from family so I gave up.  KR: How long have you been involved in fitness and how did you get involved?  HP: I have been involved in fitness for 10 years. Right before my 21st birthday I looked in the mirror and saw things, that well, looked like what I saw on my mother. Saddlebags, love handles, etc., so I joined a small gym called ""Performance fitness"" that was just down the road. I began taking aerobic classes and fell in love.  Three months later my husband and I both joined Bally's and I began weight training and have been hooked ever since. I remember I would never train my chest because I was afraid I would look too much like a guy, so I trained every other body part, until my husband convinced me otherwise! In 1995 my husband and I moved to Florida where he became the Fitness Director at Gold's Gym and trained many, many clients. I loved going into the gym at 11:00pm and having the entire place to myself to train -- it was awesome! Those were the days which are all different, now that I'm a mother.  KR: What kind of shape were you in before you became pregnant?  HP: I was in above average shape before I got pregnant. My body fat was around 19-20% and I trained 5 days a week, but not at the intensity I do now. I was kind of in a ""maintenance"" mode. I wasn't making huge gains, but also wasn't gaining body fat. I was size 5/6 and happy with my body.  KR: What was your pregnancy like in terms of weight gain and activity level?  HP: When I found out I was pregnant I didn't stop working out. I still trained 5 days a week, but at a lower intensity level. I still did squats, lunges, barbell curls, etc. I was really concerned about keeping my weight under control. Sometime in November, I was about 6 months along in my pregnancy, my doctor told me I was beginning to dilate and should back off on the workouts.  I guess a lot of pressure gets put on the baby from standing for periods of time while weight training as well as jumping around doing cardio. I've heard stories of women being on bedrest for long periods of time and I didn't want that to be me. At this point in my life I had been working out consistently for 7 years and felt anxious for a break. I wanted to enjoy my pregnancy and nothing else.  So let's just say I felt I was given a get out of jail free card, which isn't an excuse for how I ate, but I fulfilled all my cravings. I was 138lbs. before I got pregnant, and was about 183lbs when I gave birth. You do the math... +45lbs!!  KR: How did you feel about your body after you gave birth?  HP: I hated my body after I gave birth. Like I said I had been in above average shape for the past 7 years and felt disgusted with how I looked. I hated feeling how loose and rolly-polly my stomach was. Yuck. I was really, really depressed. I avoided looking in the mirror all together. I began to breastfeed (which was awesome) and started burning calories from the get go. I remember every time after I finished nursing my baby I was starving! Once I got the okay from my doc I began working out again, about 6 weeks after giving birth.  KR: What was your training schedule and nutrition plan like after the pregnancy?  HP: In the beginning there was no plan. I was nursing my son what seemed like every 2-3 hours (hmmm, kinda how I eat now!) and was completely exhausted. I tried to get to the gym 3-4 days a week, easing my way back into it. I didn't have much energy or drive, it was harder than what I had expected. I remember a few times while I was at the gym my husband would call saying my son had woken up and was screaming to be nursed, so needless to say my workouts got cut short many times.  As far as nutrition goes, I started cleaning up my diet. I knew making wise food choices would be beneficial for my health, state of mind, and would be good for my son since I was nursing. So I began eating healthy again once he was born. Or course, I'd have treats and cheats, I just tried to limit it to the weekends.  KR: You didn't decide to compete until after you had a child. What sparked the interest in figure competition?  HP: My son was 10 months old when Davana Medina won the first ever Figure National title. I remember looking at her picture and thinking, ""I want to do that!"" She looked so awesome and her body type is very, very similar to mine. That's what sparked my interest. Then, I went to the Arnold Classic in 2003 and saw the first ever Pro Figure show and that pretty much sealed my fate.  I felt I had a good chance since I had been weight training for 9 years. I knew I had great muscle maturity. I also knew the hard part would be shedding the fat. I got down to a comfortable size 7/8 and some 9/10's for about 2 years after giving birth. I wasn't thrilled with my condition and knew competition dieting would get me where I wanted to be, back down to my pre-baby size of a 5/6.  KR: How long did you prepare for the 2003 Figure Nationals?  HP: I began dieting February 2nd, 2003 to prepare for a local NPC show, the Michael Francois classic held on May 28th, 2003. I placed 15th out of 26 girls. I wasn't unhappy with my placing. I wasn't as lean as I wanted to be and my posing was horrible! My body fat was 11.5% for that show.  It was a start, and I was hooked. I set my sights on Nationals and kept dieting straight through. I had 12 weeks before Nationals. I actually took about 6 weeks after the show in May and tried to take advantage of the anabolic phase I was about to enter. I trained heavy and increased my calories. I then started dieting hard the last 6 weeks. It was rough. My body didn't like being in such a calorie ""deficit"".  I remember so many times when I would stand up I would get dizzy and see stars. That's not good. I was probably starting to become a little catabolic, not to mention my body was being stubborn and did not want to let go of any more fat. I now know with every show I do, I will stay leaner more naturally. It just takes time. Not to mention I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for all the support and coaching from my wonderful husband, Craig. He has been there every step of the way.  KR: How did you feel about the results for your first national show?  HP: I was so HAPPY! I came in at about 9.5% body fat. I was the 5th call out in my one piece (20th-25th place) and the 6th call out for my two piece (25th-30th place) and that was out of 64 girls! I left feeling more invigorated and focused than I've ever felt in my life.  For the first time I actually feel I'm where I belong. I've longed to compete, but didn't want to compete as a female bodybuilder and knew I had no chance of doing fitness contest since I couldn't do a back flip if my life depended on it! It was one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had. I didn't need a trophy to feel I accomplished my goal. Being on that stage summed it all up for me.  KR: What are your fitness goals for the future?  HP: Right now I am working on my ""lagging"" body parts and training really heavy to put some more size on my upper body. I plan on competing at the Jr. USA's in April. When I tell people about the next show I'm doing they always say... ""you've got time, it's so far away..."" but I'm on a scheduled program and feel it's right around the corner! Sometimes I feel a little frantic because I want to start dieting 16 weeks out for the Jr. USA's which means right after Christmas it all beginsand we all know how the holidays sneak up on us!!  KR: If there were one thing you could tell a mother looking to get into shape post-pregnancy, what would it be?  HP: Set a goal. Have a date in mind that you'd like to reach your goal by and go for it! Having a goal helps you stay focused. Realize you are not just doing it for yourself, but for your child too. There's nothing to it but to do it. Of course you are busy, but plan each day with some sort of activity. Have forethought and prepare yourself for a life of good health and fitness... for the rest of your life. Kids are full of tons of energy and it takes good mental and physical health just to keep up with them!

Post-Pregnancy Plan: 8 New-Mom Fitness Rules
It's a few weeks after delivery, and you're itching to get back your pre-baby body. Here's your post-pregnancy fitness plan.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/post-pregnancy-plan-8-new-mom-fitness-rules.html,"Your body is amazing. For nine months you focused all of your energy on creating another human being, and you finally accomplished it. Congratulations! But even if you were active during your first trimester, you've likely gained some unwanted weight or lost pre-pregnancy definition. When it comes to regaining your figure, working out is essential. But knowing when to work out, what to expect, and how to steer clear of temptation is even more important. Luckily, I've been through it twice. Here are eight helpful the rules I picked up along the way! 1 / Follow Recovery Recommendations My midwife didn't give me clearance to work out until six weeks postpartum. That's a standard recommendation, which maybe even longer if you had a c-section. Follow it. Working out too soon can actually make your recovery period last longer; cause long-term damage to your stomach muscles; and, if you are breastfeeding, affect your milk supply. Instead of giving in to that itch to hit the treadmill or biceps curl to exhaustion, go on a family walk. Just 30 minutes each day of a fresh air stroll a day has been shown to increase your cardiorespiratory fitness, decrease body fat, and reduce depression.1  2 / Prep and Freeze Meals Pre-Baby If you're struggling to find the time to work out right after your baby's born, focus on your nutrition. After my first son was born, I was tired, sore, and emotionaland I had a fussy baby who wouldn't let me put him down for long. Cooking was out of the question. I resorted to the easy, unhealthy route: think lots of pizza delivery and cold cereal. If you aren't focusing on the food you're fueling your body with, you're probably going to have a tough time shedding the weight and toning up.The second time around, I decided to come prepared and freeze healthy meals that I could pop in the crock pot once the baby arrived. Chicken tortilla, beef and barley, and minestrone soup were all on the menu, along with honey lime and sweet and sour chicken. I also prepped double batches of Jamie Eason's protein bars, which were a lifesaver after the baby came.  3 / Say Yes to Protein Powder (One Serving) My doctor told me that one serving of protein powder per day was perfectly fine to use while nursing, as long as it wasn't my only source of protein for the day. Try to use protein powders that don't include artificial sweeteners or fillers. My favorite kind of protein is MRM All Natural Whey Rich Vanilla flavorit's what I used while I was pregnant and now that I am breastfeeding. If you have questions, always check with your doctor. 4 / Leave Junk Food at the Checkout Counter While it might seem like a no-brainer, giving up junk food can be a struggle, especially for a new mom. Exhaustion will likely weaken your willpower, and the meals people bring as gifts might not be the healthiest option. Still, you'll be grateful, and you'll eat them. Counter the platters of lasagna, chicken fingers, and baked mac and cheese by stocking up on fresh fruit and lean protein. Prepare easy-to-grab snacks like homemade protein bars and pre-packed sliced veggies.  5 / Breastfeed to Speed Up Weight Loss Bag the bottle. Not only will breastfeeding ensure you're passing on whole-food nutrients to your baby, it will also help you shed the baby weight.You can burn up to 500 calories per day just by breastfeeding! It also helps your uterus contract, which will help make your stomach flatten faster during those first two weeks. Breastfeeding can be difficult at first. I struggled nursing my daughter in the first two weeks. Try reading up on breastfeeding before the baby is bornIna May's Guide to Breastfeeding was the most helpful book I foundand prepare to work with a lactation consultant after the baby comes.  6 / Once Cleared to Work Out, Squeeze Them in When You Can Don't count on consistency. Once you get clearance to exercise, it's unlikely that you'll still have a full hour to dedicate to the Stairmaster. It might be hard to get into a regular schedule during the first couple of months when the baby's still not sleeping through the night, and most gym daycare facilities won't take babies until they're at least 6 months old. So squeeze in a trip to the gym whenever you can, and get creative with at-home workouts. I've gotten some serious results using Ashley Conrad's Celebrity Abs routine. Still strapped for time? Remember, even a short post-dinner family walk while pushing the stroller or strapping on the baby carrier is better than doing nothing at all.  7 / Celebrate Your Small Victories I really struggled with this one after I first got back in the gym. The extra weight left me feeling frustrated, and I was embarrassed that I couldn't lift heavy. I felt like I didn't belong in the weight room around all the fit people. I pushed through it by reminding myself that I'd felt this way after my first son was born, and that nothing was going to change until I started putting in the work. You can feel uncomfortable now or three months from now, but you're always going to have a starting point. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll stop feeling self-conscious. I try to remind myself that I feel better when I work out. It builds my confidence, makes me happier, and usually leads me to make smarter nutritional choices. Your workouts might not start out as intense as they were pre-pregnancy, but you'll eventually get back to that point and should be proud of your progress along the way.  8 / Remember, It's Not a Race Getting back in shape takes time, and simply removing the baby that was inside you isn't enough to get back your tight tummy. After I had my first son, I was surprised that I came home and still looked six months pregnant. I remember feeling so bad about the extra weight. While I eventually shed the pounds and regained my shape, it didn't happen overnight. It took months. If I had known that most women still look pregnant after they have a baby, my self-talk would have been a little more loving. Clean eating and exercise will get you back in shape, but give yourself a realistic time frame. Now I know not to expect to feel totally back to normal for 9-12 monthsthe time it takes for me to lose the weight, for my hips to go back down, and to rebuild the muscle I had pre-pregnancy. On my website and Facebook page I've been sharing my post-partum photos during this process to hopefully try to normalize the images we see of a woman's normal post-partum belly and hopefully make other people feel comfortable during the process as well.

An Interview With Celebrity Personal Trainer Ashley Borden.
With almost 20 years experience as a trainer, Ashley has learned many lessons. As a celebrity trainer she has had experiences most of us can only dream about. In the following interview she shares her knowledge and experiences.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson332.htm,"Ashley Borden: the name is synonymous with physical performance results, and advanced body transformation. Excellence: what Ashley strives for when aiming to take her clients' health and fitness goals to new heights and what her clients themselves have come to expect from Ashley. And results and excellence are probably responsible for the LA fitness guru and body transformation specialist's reputation and success as a celebrity personal trainer.  Traditionally a population with high aspirations and standards, the celebrity crowd are, as would be expected, an exceedingly challenging group to work with. As their careers either live or die based on how they look and perform, it is Ashley's job to ensure that each of her clients' enjoys longevity and prosperity as an entertainer, a role she never tires nor fails at.  In an industry where you are hot one day and not the next, each celebrity Ashley guides seeks her out specifically, to help keep them at the relevant end of the entertainment spectrum.  Click Image To Enlarge.Ashley Borden. But what separates Ashley from the thousands of personal trainers currently expanding into the celebrity market? For one thing she has 17 years experience training a wide range of people, from the housewife to the elite sporting-star.  Then there is her personal battle with eating disorders that have, understandably, given her a strong sense for helping others and the experience necessary for turning negatives into positives. And this goes to the very heart of body transformation.  By its very nature, a body transformation necessitates a strong will to overcome some kind of physical flaw, whether largely perceived as in the muscular bodybuilder who sees himself as being small, or startlingly real as in the overweight housewife in dire need of an effective fat loss program.  Regardless of how extreme, any body transformation requires professional intervention from one who has both the experience and the desire to really help, to make a difference and to facilitate positive change. This is what separates Ashley from the pack and makes her the best in her field.  With almost 20 years experience as a trainer, Ashley has learned many lessons. As a celebrity trainer she has had experiences most of us mere mortals can only dream about. In the following Bodybuilding.com interview she shares her knowledge and her experiences.  Interview  [ Q ] How long have you been a personal trainer Ashley?     I've been a  personal trainer for 17 years.  [ Q ] Was celebrity personal training a gradual progression for you or was this something you started out doing?     No, since I started my training business it (the celebrity training) has just been an ongoing progression. A lot of celebrity training has to do with living in the town where the action is happening so it just happened through referrals. I was just working at the gym and they had someone come in. It was a referral and then it was all basically word of mouth from there, especially in the entertainment industry.  [ Q ] Who was your first celebrity client?     My first celebrity client was Sean Hayes who was on Will and Grace. We worked on building muscle. I put about 17 pounds of muscle on his frame and we trained the whole off-season (when not filming) and he got so muscular and looked so good the producers were horrified that he was so big. And they were, ""You know what, he is too muscular."" I was, ""You don't have to hate on it; you can make him look skinny and scrawny."" But he was great; he and I worked very well together. He is one of my dearest friends here.  Click Image To Enlarge.Sean Hayes And Ashley Borden. [ Q ] When he first began training with you he was training specifically to get big for another role or for personal reasons?     No, he was on Will and Grace and he just had a  goal. He wanted to get bigger and stronger. At the time we were actually doing the  Body for Life program together - he is incredibly strong and just ate well. It was just a goal he had. And we did it together.   Body for Life Body for Life is a 12-week diet and exercise program, and also an annual physique transformation competition. It was created by Bill Phillips, a former competitive bodybuilder and the founder of EAS, a manufacturer of nutritional supplements. It has been popularized by a bestselling book of the same name.   [ Q ] And he dropped his body fat correspondingly?     Absolutely!  [ Q ] Was this the first time Sean Hayes had trained specifically for muscle size?     No he had a trainer before at the same gym. He left his trainer and came and worked with me.  [ Q ] I understand you also worked with multiple UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championships) Champion, Matt Hughes. What specifically did you do with Matt?     I actually did not manage his training; I managed his food.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  An Interview With 9-Time UFC Champ Matt Hughes!  Join me as Matt talks about past fights, training, nutrition, off-season, and more right here.   Author: Layne Norton  [ Q ] You were his nutritionist?     Well I am not a nutritionist nor am I a registered dietician, but I still handle many people's food intake, depending on what their goals are. I call this role the food manager. Basically, with Matt, what we discovered was he was eating more like a bodybuilder than an  endurance athlete.   Matt already ate great; I mean he didn't eat bad food. He's not a sugar eater; he's a very clean eater but part of it was he needed to eat way more low glycemic carbohydrates.  When he was training for a fight he was losing up to four to six pounds (bodyweight) a workout so he really needed to make sure he was not burning muscle, and that he was burning up carbohydrates, that he was not consuming at the time. So we just tweaked his ratio of carbs to protein to fats and educated him a little bit on what carbohydrates would really be good for him to eat, that would give him sustained energy.  Part of it is that Matt was already incredibly strong but part of the issue was he would not get his second wind until late into his workout; he would start to really feel strong then. Which is great but the problem was he was eating into his muscle. And he didn't realize the difference. So we changed his post and pre-workout drinks, and his carbohydrates, and put him on Udo's (Choice) Oil and he went great.   RELATED PRODUCT  Udo's Choice Presents: Oil Blend   Udo's Choice Oil Blend is a unique blend of oils and nutritional co-factors that meet all of the esential fatty acid needs of your body. An ideal 2:1 ratio of omega 3 and 6 essential fatty acids, proven by research to benefit cardiovascular health, enhance stamina and energy, and improve general health and well-being. [ Click here to learn more. ]  [ Q ] Just to clarify, what benefits did Udo's Oil give Matt?     Udo's (Choice) Oil is a pure blend of a 2:1 ratio of  omega 3 and  6essential fatty acids; it is in a glass bottle and it is made from an incredible  company that is based out of Canada. The oil helped with  recovery; it helped to load more lean muscle tissue on him and he took it pretty consistently. That was something that he changed.   He also works with Nutritox, which has great products as well. So he was on a really good combo of the right amount of supplements without overdoing it and also getting most of his nutrition from real foods, which is what he prefers.

[ Q ] So prior to you managing Matt's nutrition, he already had a good diet but just needed to make a few subtle changes, nothing too drastic.    Yes, absolutely. He just needed to change his  carbohydrate ratio and understand what carbs, from low to moderate, were the good ones for him to have as opposed to high glycemic carbohydrates.  [ Q ] What were Matt's measurable results?     Matt never, ever complains and never whines or anything about feeling tired or sore. So his thing was really the sustained energy throughout his long training. He splits his training throughout the day and he was just able to do it and he wasn't having the bonking as much. He wasn't hardcore bonking; it was just a matter of having more sustained energy for him throughout his whole workout.  [ Q ] Did his performance in the Octagon improve?     I don't know really. Another thing: Matt didn't eat enough  greens before and I think he became a real  broccoli man so that was good. He was not big vegetable eater and we really tried to get him to eat a lot more green vegetables so he would have more good  fiber and carbs. I think he felt a lot better after doing this. We also took away his red meat during his training phase.  [ Q ] He would have got his creatine and iron from supplements?     Yes,  Nutritox took care of that.

Ashley was chosen as the Bodybuilding.com Personal Trainer of the Month because of her dedication to improving lives!   Author: Ashley Borden  [ Q ] When you are working with a bodybuilding athlete versus a mixed martial artist, would you tend to increase protein and decrease carbohydrates?     Well I think it depends. If it is someone who is really in competition, for the art of being absolutely as lean as possible, I would hand that off to somebody who is an expert in that area because that takes a lot more specific science; to get somebody to three percent  body fat. I would probably have somebody work with me who has worked with bodybuilders before so they could help manage it.  [ Q ] You specialize more in body transformations?     Yes, absolutely - body transformations and also getting the job done. For instance when Matt and I were in Hillsborough,  avocados were really out of season. But we went to this Mexican food restaurant and I said, ""Lets just ask the manager if they get shipments of avocados from somewhere else, lets see if they can get you a whole crate of them."" And it is just where if the athlete doesn't have it they won't eat it.   Matt had so many other things to worry about. It is kind of like I make sure they have all of their supplements, and all the foods they need so they have the least amount of things to think about. They can then just consume the food and worry about their training.   2008 Bodybuilding.comTransformation Guide! Whether your goals are to gain motivation, make a personal transformation, lose fat, gain muscle, or both then look no further. [ Check It Out Here! ]   [ Q ] You mentioned avocados a moment ago. I have found with my own clients that using avocados as a healthy source of fat is an excellent idea as it really fills the individual up and satiates them while providing valuable nutrients.     You know what, it is great. I have really found that there is a fat shortage. People with their diets are like, still living in the '80s and not eating any good fats. And I really found that increasing your good fats, especially from avocados, supports a host of health benefits, and it's also satiating for people who maybe psychologically love butter or cream cheese or spread: they can use avocado as a spread and the texture of it is really creamy and good and it helps to satiate people who might be used to a certain taste. It is a great alternative to bad fats.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Good & Bad Fats!

Every single one of my clients, whether they are professional athletes or a stay at home mom, all learn the same basic system which is basically called the LIFT system (Lift Integrated Systematic Training) and that way I approach everybody, bodybuilder or non-bodybuilder, in a way that assesses the body in the most aesthetically correct way.   I start with them taking their shoes and socks off and I look at the arches of their feet when they are standing in a neutral position. So I start from there and depending on how the arches look, this will give me a compete map of the chain of the rest of their body.  If somebody comes to me and says, ""I can't get my back and triceps up or my rear deltoids just won't develop,"" the chances are they have probably more a collapsed arch and they have forward head carriage and they are not even aware of it. And they are not posturally aligned. The training that I do really focuses on all of the postural stuff, the postural muscles and the whole kinetic chain; very biomechanics-based.   Editors Note: One of the most prevalent postural deviations is called anterior head carriage (or forward head carriage) and is usually the result of sitting for prolonged periods with the head tilted forward (as in sitting at a computer desk all day long).   Mothers who breastfeed or parents in general who spend time leaning forward to attend to their infant or child also experience this problem. This problem causes excessive neck strain and can seriously affect everyday movement and performance. It can be corrected with the help of a professional like Ashley Borden who teaches correct postural alignment.    [ Q ] That's a smart approach.     And I incorporate a lot of myofascial release, a lot of that.  [ Q ] Can you explain this concept further?     Myofascial release is, in layman's terms, is a very deep tissue massage, basically. For instance I worked on Matt when his shoulders were feeling tight. There is a way of working certain pressure points, and moving the muscle around releases the muscle so it becomes more open and stringy and more blood flows through it.   So when you go to train you haven't just stretched a tight muscle with a lot of muscle adhesions, you have actually opened up the muscle and all the tissue. So then when you stretch it, it is able to stretch in a healthier manner in the tissue rather than making the knot tighter so it won't stretch. It's great.  I do it with all of my clients and most of them use a PVC pipe as opposed to the white foam rollers that a lot physical therapists use. I go a little bit deeper than that and like to use a PVC pipe. It's an integral part of the system (LIFT), the training session as well. They ""roll out"" for about ten minutes before they train.  [ Q ] It sounds like you could actually change the shape of a muscle through myofascial release.     Absolutely. I mean quicker than anything I've ever witnessed in my life. It's great for body changing.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Self-Myofascial Release.   What are the differences between the rollers? There are the plain white foam rollers, and then there're the high density ones for advanced users.   Started By: galapogos  [ Q ] With a biceps peak, for example, through this method you could free up the muscle belly itself to promote additional growth.     Exactly. And for somebody who has a really tight  biceps, they are not going to be able to really get their  triceps to fire or become more sculpted. So you have to release the biceps so they can fire or contract the triceps.  [ Q ] Moving onto some of your other celebrity clients, what did you do specifically to improve the shape of Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore in terms of both diet and training?     I trained Christina for about three and a half, four years, stopping two years ago. I went on tour with her and trained her in LA; also did her strip tour with her.   When I started working with her she was very young and had a naturally skinny body, and Christina really wanted to work on her strength and training. And she was more reluctant about her food, so over the course of time it was really just educating her in more of a passive way - how changing her food will affect her stamina onstage.  If she wants she will be able to perform a lot longer and not feel like she will crash from it. When they got the menu for the venues I would look to see what food would be in there. I would then change things to make sure that we had turkey slices and vegetables as opposed to just Doritos and Jolly Ranchers.  [ Q ] That sounds like a full-time job for you?     Well it was a full-time job (laughs).  [ Q ] So you would put all of your other clients on hold while you dealt with Christina? Is that how it worked?    If I was touring with her I was with her 24/7. When I was at home (in LA) I was seeing her four times a week.  [ Q ] What strategy did you use with Mandy Moore?    With Mandy, when I trained her we got her into the most phenomenal shape I have ever seen. Mandy was somebody who grew very quickly; she's very tall (5' 10"").   When we first started working together she did not have really good proprioceptive work and balance and did not feel in very good control of herself muscularly, so we really worked on her posture. She had some spinal issues and we had to work on myofascial release - being rolled out.  Click Image To Enlarge.Mandy Moore And Ashley Borden. [ Q ] Did she become very strong as she progressed?     Yes and her  endurance improved also. Absolutely. When she learned how to control her body she became incredibly, 100 percent stronger. She was like a different person. She moved like an athlete as opposed to somebody who had no control over her body.  [ Q ] Did she train for anything specific?     She had been dating Andy Roddick when I first started working with her and, again, she was doing it because she just wanted to. She had never trained before. And again I had met her at a gym and she was training with somebody else and then she asked if she could work with me.  [ Q ] Over what period did you train Mandy Moore?     From 2004 to 2006, and Christina was probably three years ago.  [ Q ] How long do you train an average client?     For one hour.  [ Q ] And how long would their transformation take, on average?     My average client stays with me for about four to six years. RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Personal Training!

Author: Ivan Blazquez  [ Q ] Who has been your easiest celebrity to train and why?     Annabeth Gish is the easiest celebrity to train by far. She is a phenomenal actress. She is like an athlete; she really understands the body and has done a lot of her own work on her own body and on her training. She loves the systems that I teach and she can do an incredibly  focused, very slow specific workout, or I can just kick her @ss all over the gym. She is just a lot of fun to train: just a normal person.  [ Q ] People who want to train are generally the easiest to train. Right?     Yes. When I trained Mandy, Mandy was good. She was there to train three or four times a week. She came to every gym session; very low key and not a diva at all. But I would say that Annabeth is probably the most fun to train.  [ Q ] When you talk about divas, do you mean those who place a lot of unnecessary demands on you as a trainer outside the training spectrum?     To me when you are training, you are coming in to train, focus and then leave. It's a focused, serious hour of doing the work that I want to do with them. Some people, male or female, don't respect the time or respect themselves enough to take the training really seriously.   Just having me wait is one thing. I've had clients who have had me sitting there waiting in the next room while they are on the phone for 45 minutes. Then they get 15 minutes of training and wonder why their body is not changing.  [ Q ] No respect for your time.     Yes and these people I find don't have respect for themselves as well, so it usually goes hand in hand.

[ Q ] Your lips are sealed for now.     Well you know I honestly don't feel there is anybody I could not work with. I'm able to do my work and not be as emotionally involved as I think some people might be.  [ Q ] How often do you have people who cause you to wait while they are on the phone?     I have had that happen many times.  [ Q ] And these are mainly celebrity people.     Probably, yes. I actually had a celebrity client once who wanted to  smoke a cigarette during the training session. I am not kidding.  Smoking Articles:  Effects Of Smoking And Drinking On Bodybuilders! - By Herve Duchemin Stop Smoking For Better Health! - By Dave Draper Smoking & Musculoskeletal Pain! - By Mauro Di Pasquale Other Smoking Articles...  [ Q ] Who was this, a rock star of some sort?     Not even a rock star; that is the worst part (laughs). You know I think that is sometimes part of the whole game when working with celebrities.   I think what's really important is that there are so many really great trainers out there that don't train celebrities that should give way more attention to other people. And that's something that I have always been aware of; that my training and education is probably 100 percent way more important than who I train, but I guess that who you train is what makes it interesting for people.  It's sad because there are a lot of phenomenal trainers that have an incredible amount of information to give out, but because they don't train celebrities, people don't care. It is just that they don't have a vehicle to get the information out so easily.  [ Q ] Now that you are an established celebrity trainer, do people seek you out to train them, or are you always looking for potential clients? How does that work?     It is usually word of mouth. At our gym we have a team of people, so generally it is like a network of people. Part of it too is if you work with that population, you respect their privacy and ""get"" that it is just part of your job. You are not the rock star; you are working with them.  [ Q ] And there is a special code of conduct and confidentiality protocol that governs what you do with celebrity people versus the general population?     Yes, absolutely.  [ Q ] You would sign a waver before training each celebrity?     Yes I have had to do that many times.  Click Image To Enlarge.NIKE Stretch Photo. [ Q ] Who is the most interesting or eccentric person you have ever trained?     You want me to name people?  [ Q ] Yes, or just give me some more examples. The person who asked to smoke while training sounds crazy to say the least.     I would say the person who wants to smoke while training is more of an addict (laughs) or has a death wish. Even if there was something negative to say there is nobody who I could talk about (laughs).  [ Q ] I guess it all comes under the confidentiality agreement.     Yes, and you still want to work in this industry.  [ Q ] For people who read the gossip magazines and wish to emulate a particular person, like Brad Pitt for example, what advice would you give them?     The first thing I would say is before you go obsessing over wanting to be somebody else, I would first take a look at their body type and make sure that it is a  body type that is similar to yours. If you want to look like Elle McPherson and you are 5' 2"" it is never going to happen.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Brad Pitt's Training!   Pitt's physique first gained national attention when he took his shirt off to kick the @ss of his alter ego in the movie 'Fight Club.'   Author: Brian Bullman  [ Q ] So be realistic.     Yes, look at the body structure and the body type and know that no matter what, you will have to have a similar or the same body type. I even say to people, to wish that you were a celebrity or look like one, the energy you put into this could be put into improving yourself; what you want to improve about yourself, not what you want to look like.  [ Q ] The by-product of that approach would be better mental and physical self-development.    Yes you have to identify what it is you really want.  [ Q ] What is your take on people who become obsessed with the way they look and their training in general?     Well I recovered from some eating problems, compulsive exercise and everything, and the gift (I have) is that I understand it. I had a professional  Karate woman who was very much an over trainer. She would train three times a day and her body was just continuously breaking down.   There is a lot of psychological stuff that goes along with over training. It's a step-by-step process, like anything. Whether it is under training or over training. With over training people sometimes think what a great thing to have, but it can incredibly damage your body and break you down way quicker than you think, especially as an athlete: it can end their career much quicker.

[ Q ] I suppose on one level you would be a counselor, helping people to make positive lifestyle changes; developing their mental approach. Which would, in turn, assist their training efforts and enhance their life in general.     Oh definitely because I feel like, for myself because I had such a mental change - had to change my life and how I approached everything - that I really feel like many people have disordered eating - not necessarily an  eating disorder. I think that when you are able to break it down, that does help.   You need to keep a journal. That is one big thing I have my clients do - always keep a journal. Even if they just set an egg timer and write a stream of consciousness for ten minutes at the end of the day, they will be a lot less likely to binge or overeat because they are able to stop their feelings somewhere and not have them be in their food, which is usually a huge trigger.  Also they can see in their own handwriting how great they feel when they are training and eating well. Your own handwriting is a much better way of identifying, ""Oh that's right I did feel that way before."" As opposed to just trying to remember the times when you did feel great.  [ Q ] What exactly is a stream of consciousness?     A lot of people say they don't want to write in a journal; that they don't know what to say. So I'll say, ""Do this."" So you don't have to worry about the time and you don't have to feel like it is an overwhelming amount of time. People usually aren't used to writing.   The thought of sitting down and writing for an hour seems like forever. So I usually say use something like an egg timer (so you know when it begins and ends) and set it for ten minutes.  Get out a piece of paper and start by writing. You might feel like you don't know what to write, but that is your stream of consciousness. Write what you are feeling and slowly it will just start coming out. It is just like a practice in journaling for people who have a hard time putting pen to paper.

Just write out exactly what you are thinking in the moment just for ten minutes. Chances are you will get to what you want to put on paper.  [ Q ] Or you may have to go back to decipher what you have written to make sense out of it all (laughs).     (laughs) Correct, I would say you are playing detective with yourself.  [ Q ] If somebody comes to you with a body image problem, what would you do? Have you ever encountered this in any of your clients?     Oh yeah. The body image problems I encounter with men are usually: they either think that they are way smaller than they are - and that's a big one - or no matter what they do they constantly think that they are small. They want to be bigger or they don't see themselves as big as they actually are.   Also men, or women, who are heavy their whole life growing up, it is the same thing: they look in the mirror and see themselves as that overweight little kid still, even if they have an incredible body. That's why I think a lot of it is the mixture of the mental and the physical; you kind of have to heal both.  [ Q ] No matter what they achieve in the gym they are never really satisfied with how they look.     Exactly.  [ Q ] Have you ever encountered someone who is so obscenely large but feel they are really small?     Men who use steroids in general really are people who are hiding in their bodies. Steroid abuse, while not as prevalent where I am, which is not at Gold's, is seen commonly. You will have guys who use Winstrol and they don't talk about it. That's the thing: if you are going to do steroids then tell people that you are doing them. There are a lot of people who don't know much about steroids and they think if that guy is big they might get to that level too.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Steroid Temptations!

Author: Myron Mielke  [ Q ] If people were more honest about their drug intake it would not provoke unrealistic expectations in others?     Yes, but I understand it is illegal. And number two: it is still not worth it in the big scheme of things. There are pros and cons to it. But it is like anything else, if you are cheating and you don't want to tell people you are cheating. I think it is just better if you tell people what you are doing.  [ Q ] If a guy is on steroids and decides to stop taking them, is there a possibility that he will become very unhappy?     Oh yes, are you kidding me? Absolutely. It's an addiction; steroids are addictive. I have been very close to steroid addiction; it is awful. Steroid abuse leads to so many more negatives in your life that have nothing to do with the way you look. You rage and all of that.   Editors Note: Ashley knew someone on an intimate level who was using steroids for many years.   [ Q ] If someone has a body image problem to begin with and then takes steroids will he compound and exacerbate that problem?     Yes, it is that you are not really addressing what is going on (on the inside), you are just putting on a different suit.   CLASSIC QUOTE""You are not really addressing what is going on (on the inside), you are just putting on a different suit."" Ashley Borden on steroid abuse.  [ Q ] But steroids can have some positive uses, if used sensibly, in an intelligent fashion.     Well with steroids you are not even getting performance enhancing benefits. You are just getting bigger. You are not even in a  sport. What are you doing?  [ Q ] So you are saying bodybuilders take steroids for purely aesthetic reasons? But steroids can also improve strength and speed, so in that sense, are performance enhancing also.    And ego. I just want to say, if you are going to do it just be honest and say, ""This is what I do."" I think this would demystify what a lot of men don't get and why they feel defeated when they have been in the gym for six weeks and don't understand why they are not getting the same results and pump the guy next to him who is doing a Deca and Winstrol stack is getting. Then they feel they have to take them too.  [ Q ] It's an arms race with chemicals.     Exactly.   CLASSIC QUOTE""It's an arms race with chemicals."" David Robson on excessive steroid use.  [ Q ] You train celebrities and the average person. Do you take a different approach when training celebrities? Do you have to consider any additional aspects when working with this population?     I am very confident with what I do, thank God, and don't really work from a place of fear. I'm very comfortable with what I do. I trained a very high profile person who was in the Rap industry. He had a very bad reputation and I said I don't train men in their homes and that if he wanted to he could come to my gym, I would train him there.   So I trained him along with another guy. And he did; he trained with me seven times. He showed up, he was on time. He listened to everything I said and there was nothing inappropriate. But it had to be in the setting I was comfortable in. I would not have done it if he wanted me to go and train him in his house.  [ Q ] And who was this person?    I cannot say.  [ Q ] No problem. Do you do any kind of in-home training?     Yes I do in-home training but it really depends on how comfortable I am. Put it this way: that was probably one of the only times where it was an uncomfortable situation. I have had such great clients; I have never had any problems, ever.   This was a unique situation and I didn't feel conformable in his home with him. But he was really cool about it. The key is you have to be very clear and know where your boundaries are and that way you are able to be professional and not feel like you have to compromise anything.

Author: Joe Franco  [ Q ] When training a celebrity is there a greater awareness that these people are in a completely different social class and therefore what you do with them might be placed under the microscope to a greater extent?     It is. Christina Aguilera is like nobody else. She is a mega superstar; with her unique set of circumstances and what she has to experience not a lot of people experience so I think a big part of it too is you have to go with the flow. We were ready to train whenever she wanted to train but you also had to be willing to go with the flow. It's just different.   It's not as regimented as when you are training somebody who is in the office at 8:00am and who leaves at 5:00pm. Especially when you are on the road with them (celebrities). Whoever I'm with I just try to make sure they can eat well and drink a lot of water and do body work and train as much as they want to.  [ Q ] In saying all of that you wouldn't treat them any differently than you would an average client, right? Your exercise protocols stay the same.     That's right, everybody is treated the same.  [ Q ] I suppose you would be privy to a lot of secrets being on the road with these people.     Yes. I mean I guess it depends on the client. But that is why they have you sign confidentiality agreements.  [ Q ] Maybe one day you can write a book about your experiences on the road. And then they might sue you, right?     Right and then I will get sued (laughs). But I get it. I get that you want to have people around you in a positive way. People are just so quick to exploit people in a negative way. I just really understand it (what the client wants). I can't imagine having people around you who just want to publish books and write stories about people; you have absolutely no privacy.  [ Q ] But in saying that there can be a fine line between simply digging up any old dirt on someone and publishing something that is relevant, that captures the publics' interest in a positive way; something that might entertain and/or educate.     Yes but if I am in the privacy of their home, it is private; so what I see and hear there stays there.  [ Q ] Very good point. Thank you for your insights Ashley. Is there anything you wanted to mention in particular before we end this interview?

Height: 5'7"" Dress Size: 16  Now: Weight: 140 lbs. Dress Size: 5/6  Why I Got Started  Six months after my second set of twins (3 years ago) I looked terrible. I had a spare tire around my waist and I wore a size 16. Actually size 16 was tight around my middle. Having to deal with two 3-year olds and two infants was a huge challenge. I did not have time to exercise nor did I want to make the time to do it. I was sluggish and had no energy. I was tired going up the stairs. My babies did not sleep well and would be up at alternate hours to breastfeed, which meant I would sleep for an hour get up nurse a baby, put it back to sleep then sleep for an hour and repeat the process all night long. I did not think there was any way I would ever be a size 12 again. I felt so fat and ugly.  It was right at this time that a couple of my girlfriends joined Weight Watchers. I decided to join too. I wanted to get the info I needed for the program and then do the program myself. I weighed in at 183 pounds, 20 pounds more than I weighed when I was pregnant. Within 6 months of beginning the program I had lost 30 pounds. Click Image To Enlarge.Dec 2003 (left), March 2006 (right). I bought an elliptical and used it for a half hour every night doing Steady state cardio. I didn't realize that doing just cardio would burn up the muscle I had, I didn't have any anyways so I guess that wasn't really an issue. After losing the 30 pounds I didn't look terrible in clothes any more but I sure looked bad in a bathing suit or shorts. I had no muscle tone at all.  Fast forward a couple of years now. I went to visit my brother during summer vacation and he had started lifting weights. I tried bench pressing 50 pounds and could do it and thought I was so strong. He showed me how to do squats with a barbell and I was very proud of myself when I did 40 pounds. After I got home I discovered Body for Life. I decided to try that program. I stuck with it for a whole three weeks. The diet was too hard for me. I kept lifting weights but ate what I wanted.  How I Did It In January I was surfing the net and found Buffmother.com. I read her testimony and when I read that she also had twins and I saw that she was totally buff I wanted to know her secret. I joined her rally room site ASAP. Click Image To Enlarge.Download The Free Wallpaper Here!The Buffmother site talked about the wonderful fat burning benefits of having muscles. I learned not to be afraid of lifting heavy, women will not bulk up, in fact opposite. The denser your muscles become the smaller you are going to get, the muscles will burn your fat away.I have been involved in many message boards and most have been cynical and shallow. However the inspiration and encouragement I get from the buff mother Rally room really has helped me immensely, it is just not like other message boards. All the members share their workouts for the day and are really held accountable to get their workout in. I received so much encouragement and information from the rally room that Buffmother has created. I have made some great lifelong friends.  Supplements  Multi-VitaminFish oilGlutamineCreatine  Sample Week Of Training My workouts change every 2 weeks or so. For two weeks I focus on really building my muscles (bulking). I lift as heavy as I can for 3 sets of 5-6 reps. The next two weeks I switch it up and do more of a circuit type of weight workout. I do 3 sets of 10 reps with little or no rest. I still lift heavy enough to challenge my muscles. I focus on getting my heart rate up. During this time (cutting) I do some extra cardio. RELATED ARTICLE  Interval Training For Weight Loss!

No Boys Allowed: 4 Birth Control Fitness Myths
The truth is out there. You just need to know what to read.  Check out these busted myths about birth control, the menstrual cycle and fitness.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/no-boys-allowed-4-birth-control-fitness-myths.html,"We all dreaded high school rumors. Without your knowing how it happened, suddenly the whole 10th grade believed you kissed Coach Knox and were responsible for the heinous x-rated graffiti in the bathroom. It was also rumored that your dad was the caterpillar on the ""Money Tree"" commercials.These rumors had little merit, and were debunked or forgotten after a few days (unless, of course, Coach Knox looked like Jake Gyllenhaal. I wouldn't deny that rumor).I continued to hear rumors throughout my life, including a bunch having to do with women and exercise. I find these particularly interesting because a) I'm a woman and b) I'm interested in fitness.I'm not talking about rumors like: ""If women lift weights, they'll get bulky,"" or ""Women shouldn't take protein supplements."" Those rumors have been strapped to a bottle rocket and launched into the night. No, I'm talking about rumors about birth control, the menstrual cycle, and how they relate to fitness.  ""It's her body. And she chooses to work it!"" The following are rumors I've heard from eaves-dropping, my friends, coaches and the all-knowing Internet. Some of these I spent a good chunk of my life believing; others I know are absolute garbage. The third group, I'm not sure about.My goal now is to separate rumor from science, myth from reality, fact from fiction, horses from unicorns - well, you get the picture.Rumor 1 ""Birth Control Makes You Fat""When I first began using birth-control pills, I was a freshman in college. I was positive they made me gain the dreaded ""Freshman 15."" Apparently, I was not alone. According to a 2003 survey, weight gain is the No. 1 reason women quit taking contraceptives.In theory, there could be biological reasons for weight gain due to contraceptives: fluid retention and/or extra fat due to a hormonally-created increase in appetite. More likely: the weight gain is due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors having nothing to do with ""the pill.""If I consider my college lifestyle - beer, ice cream, beer, sliders, beer - then there's no wonder that Freshman 15 was so thoroughly attached to my butt and thighs. I've yet to find a study showing any sort of correlation between contraceptive use and weight gain. Although it's difficult to do any sort of longitudinal study using humans, there just isn't enough conclusive information to make any determination that birth control pills are responsible for weight gain.Whew! That makes me feel better.Birth Control Makes You Fat: FALSERumor 2 ""Birth Control Makes You Less Strong""Along the weight-gain issue, I've also heard from numerous women that contraceptives can make you weaker. It sort of makes sense, in my head at least, that the more female hormones you have in your body, the less a girl would be able to gain musculature. Boy, was I wrong. A 2008 study of NCAA Division-I female athletes didn't find any significant differences in strength or peak torque gains in women using contraceptives and women not using contraceptives.   ""Who could argue with these facts? Or these lats?"" Of course, the problem with this study is that I'm not a college athlete, and it might be unreliable to use this information to make any sort of decision for us normal people. But this study has given me food for thought.Numerous other studies found that contraceptives may have potential advantages for female athletes because the hormones stabilize the various phases of menses. This could help aerobic performance, muscle strength, and enhanced growth hormone levels. Also, since contraceptives provide some consistency in the body's thermoregulation, the body might actually perform consistently through the menstrual cycle. Neat, huh?None of these studies prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Nor do I assert that taking birth control will boost your gym performance. However, this information does alleviate some of my fears. It also makes me realize I shouldn't eavesdrop in the locker room.Birth Control Makes You Less Strong: FALSERumor 3 ""My Athletic Performance Is Worse On My Period""This rumor is pretty tough to decipher. Of course we don't always feel all that great at that time of the month. And, for some women, feeling crappy pretty much stays all day: whether they're on the basketball court, at work or lying on the couch.However, world records, gold medals and failures have occurred in all phases of the menstrual cycle. Science can't seem to document any significant changes in measures of athletic performance, and it's almost impossible to eliminate the inherent bias that comes with describing the effects of PMS. There are of course, subtle changes that occur in each of us. But again, it's difficult to measure how much this might influence athletic performance.   ""There's nothing subtle about her strength!"" According to one study, some swimmers performed worse during premenstrual times and cross-country skiers have done better post-menstruation. Investigators, it seems, aren't sure how to call this. Neither am I, for that matter. I suppose that our physical capabilities are the same no matter what is happening in our uterus. However, our minds have a huge influence, so perhaps feeling weak, tired, irritated influences how we work out. My Athletic Performance Is Worse On My Period: MAYBERumor 4 ""You're More Likely To Get Injured If You're On Your Period""This is a tough rumor to decipher, too; the evidence conflicts. Scientists base a lot of their studies on subject-answered surveys concerning the menstrual cycle. Getting accurate answers is problematic to say the least; who actually knows when she's in the Follicular Stage of the menstrual cycle? Not me (although I know some balding guys who'd love it).For those of us who aren't collegiate athletes and don't spend too much time planting, cutting, or playing tenacious defense, we probably don't have to worry too much about injuries. Of course, if you're trying to deadlift 200 pounds without even considering using your legs, you're sort of asking for it. Significant evidence suggests that women who have menstrual dysfunction are more likely to sustain injury. Women who spend too much time exercising and not enough time eating stop getting their periods and also experience low bone mineral density. Weak bones make for a weak body. Weak bodies are easily injured. See a trend here?I'd say the jury is still out on this one.

The Shadowy Valley Of Death: My Journey And Re-Birth.
I woke up early this morning, just before dawn. I hadn't been sleeping well for the last few nights, almost endless nights being lost in an abyss of emotions and uncertainty...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simon8.htm,"I woke up early this morning, just before dawn. I hadn't been sleeping well for the last few nights, almost endless nights being lost in an abyss of emotions and uncertainty. I got dressed and started to walk, I didn't know where I was going or why, I just knew that I had to get out of my house, clear my head and get my thoughts sorted.  After a bit of walking I found myself being pulled in the direction of the ocean, there was no fog, no rain everything was clear except my head and some clouds in the distance. I sat on the sand trying to figure out what I was doing with my life, how I was going to get where I wanted to go and how would I make the pain go away.  So there I was looking at the dark sky indulging in the beauty of nature, the only noise was the crashing of the waves, it is unusual to have waves at this beach but the sea always seems to reflect my own inner feelings. I wanted to have clarity like the sky on a warm summers night but I was still filled with feelings of hate, so were the waves.  All Of A Sudden...   I asked myself why I was being tested? Hadn't I been tested enough in my life already? Why was I letting myself get so angry? I realized that I had been angry for to long, it was getting me nowhere, and the comfort of alcohol was no longer comforting. I realized that for a long time I was trying to be someone that I just was not, all of the bull shit that I had gone through lately could have been avoided if I had only had the courage to stand up and say ""NO"".  I had gotten what I needed whenever I had gone against the grain. I was different from other people, I was no messiah or prodigy but I was a unique person that has a lot to offer this world. I needed to think about the situation from a different viewpoint. Most of all I had to let go and realize that I cant control everything but I can control my actions and myself.  See, I had listened to my soul when I decided to get out of the house and return to my focal point in nature. This focal point provided me with a kind of balance in my soul. This was a choice that I knew I had to make but I managed to make it when I had really let go of the situation. How often had I over looked my own inner feeling to be with nature? A lot.  I used to train inside almost exclusively indoors with artificial lights and heating, my world had become very green house in nature. Why? I was scarred to go against the grain. Why? For once I was trying to be someone that I was not.  The waves had almost settled down, so had my inner rage, I didn't need to smash anything anymore, I didn't feel the need to talk to anyone else. I was content in my own world. My own realization of the situation, the need to stop trying to control everything and time out had helped a great deal. See I have always believed that everyone is part of an eternal flow (for lack of a better way of putting it).  When we are going in the right direction things flow easily, when things get hard our flow starts to crash like a wave. We should always work towards a synergistic balance between our lives and nature, it does not matter who or what you pray to, in the end you make the choices and if you make the wrong choices, who is to blame? Only you.  I lay there on the beach, for what seemed like an eternity, happy and content with myself. I had seen where I had made mistakes, my wrong doings. I could also see the path that I had to follow.  In this moment of clarity I was invisible, I heard the ocean calling my name. I decided that following my inner voice so far had lead to great things (on a personal and emotional level) this morning so there I was neck deep in the cool ocean, being the creature of habit that I am I swam slowly out past the jetty, I have always liked to go past this point even when I was told not to. I was not thinking about what I was doing. Once I had reached the end of the jetty I floated there feeling the water around my body, being enveloped in nature, looking at the shoreline, so distant, so small.  I wondered how I could ever have been so angry and upset. I wished for rain. It slowly started to drizzle, the clouds were so beautiful and there in the ocean I realized that the rain could easily kill many people and do a lot of damage, yet when it was light rain there was nothing more life giving or beautiful. For me this was another sign suggesting to me that it is easier to destroy instead of create. Which is what I had been doing to myself, slowly destroying myself.  I decided right then and there that I would follow my chosen path, no more anger or pain. No more slow un-noticed destruction. I felt that nature was challenging me, telling me that if I decided to create instead of destroy it would keep it's promise to me, it's promise was that of always providing enough for me.  It was slowly becoming day, although it was still dark and wet. I felt the distant land calling me back, like a long lost friend trying to find me. I decided to go home. Upon my arrival it was noted by my brother and his girlfriend that I looked like a different person, to a degree that they wanted to throw a party that night because they knew that the old ME was back.  I sat down with my brother and told him about the clarity I had found by listening to my soul. He reminded me that I had always found a way of doing what ever I needed to do, when I needed to, he was just unsure of when I was going to return to my old self. When I asked him to go on with what he was saying he said, ""you have always understood the moment, you usually acted upon the moment and things always worked out well and to your favour"". At that point in time I realized that I needed to embrace the familiarity of challenge.  Embracing The Change   In essence I had given up that which I was in order to become that which I wanted to become. It was also at this point that I looked at my kettlebells; they too had been neglected, why? All my energy had been concentrated with the slow destruction of my now dead/former self. I clean my 24kg bell, it felt so good to be reunited with a dear friend, the slight impact was familiar, and slowly I pressed it, feeling great I pressed it with my left hand. I followed this by some rows and clean and jerks.  How could I have created such a distance from an essential part of my being? This was again a problem that only I had the answer for. Was it slow destruction? Was it laziness? The answer to these question was no! The answer was that I was not myself and I was trying to live my life the way other people wanted me to live it. I vowed that this would not happen again.  I now realize that my morning awakening, has made me believe in myself, I will follow my path and I understand that it will be met with foe's and tests at every advance, but that is ok like I said I will welcome any challenge, it will be what comfort's me even in the hard times.  If your life ever gets to the point that you don't know what is going on and you feel that you are getting lost in the abyss of emotion and you are no longer in control, get out of your seemingly comfortable house, away from all your worldly possessions. Get back to nature and stop seeking the meaning of life and stop thinking that you need to do something that you really don't want to.  ""The true measure of a man is not how he stands in times of convenience or comfort but, how he acts in times of terror and turmoil ""- Simon Why do a majority of us work jobs we hate... to buy shit that we don't need? Remember that the past is dead and what ever you do now is what counts. Also remember ""The true measure of a man is not how he stands in times of convenience or comfort but, how he acts in times of terror and turmoil"" I think that this is relevant.  If times are tough, men and women, stand tall and show nature and the world that you can do what is right for you. Remember to let go of a situation if you can't control it.

The First Ms. Olympia: Birth Of A Tradition!
In 1980, the IFBB sanctioned the first Ms. Olympia, which was staged in Philadelphia by Synder. The success of this competition was a watershed event in the history of bodybuilding for women.  Check out this exclusive coverage from Bill Dobbins!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/billdobbins3.htm,"The modern era of female bodybuilding began in 1977. There were a number of contests for women during the next couple of years, including ""Best In The World"" promoted by Galaxy founder George Snyder. In 1980, the IFBB sanctioned the first Ms. Olympia, which was staged in Philadelphia by Synder. The success of this competition was a watershed event in the history of bodybuilding for women.  This was due in large part to how promotable Rachel McLish, the first Ms. Olympia, turned out to be. Female bodybuilding was extremely fortunate to have Rachel associated with the sport almost from its beginning. With Rachel as the champion, the idea of women developing their muscles for aesthetic purposes was not that hard a sell.  (Click To Enlarge)Rachel McLish in a 1998 photoshoot! Following is a link to my Muscle & Fitness contest report of that first Ms. Olympia, as posted on the getbig.com website. Contemporary fans of female bodybuilding may enjoy a glimpse into the early days of physique competition for women. Many of the names of competitors in that contest are now largely forgotten, but these were the women who helped create the sport as we know it today.  The Coverage  ""My God,"" said the young man, looking in the door to watch the contestants as they signed in before the prejudging at the Ms. Olympia contest, ""I can't believe how beautiful they all are!"" It was a comment that said a lot about the first Olympia for women, as well as the current state of bodybuilding for women in general.  And, indeed, they were beautiful. In street clothes, high heels, makeup, coiffed and resplendent, it was difficult to image that these same women have so often been accused of being masculine, androgynous, or even grotesque. They were none of those things. They were gorgeous.  Patsy Chapman, with the cheekbones of a superstar model; Carmen Lusko, possessing the world's most engaging smile; Rachel McLish, with the long, lean lines of a race horse; Auby Paulick, charm and energy in equal proportions; April Micotra, Stacey Bentley, Georgia Miller, Lynn Conkwright and more - the top professionals, the best of the breed, assembled together to choose the champion of champions, the first Ms. Olympia.  Of course, in one sense, this was not yet an Olympia at all. You can't just call something on Olympia and automatically have an event with the prestige and tradition of the men's Olympia contest. Traditions take time to develop. But you have to start somewhere, and this was an auspicious beginning. Those who claimed it was no more than ""George Snyder's women's contest with a new name"" were simply missing the point.  And beautiful as these young women were, they knew full well they were not here for a beauty contest. Facial beauty matters in bodybuilding, for men as well as for women. It certainly never hurt Steve Reeves. But bodybuilding is more than just aesthetics; it has to do with muscles and physical development, and nobody was more aware of that than the Ms. Olympia competitors in Philadelphia. They had worked long and hard for this contest, And they were ready.  Actually, the contest was only one aspect of an entire weekend devoted to bodybuilding. The Association, in the persons of George Snyder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu and Bill Drake, had planned two days of seminars (featuring such stars as Arnold, Franco, Frank Zane, Mike Mentzer and Danny Padilla), a display of some of the latest developments in exercise equipment and health industry products, and a huge banquet preceding the finals of the contest.  ""The turnout is fantastic,"" George Snyder told me the afternoon of the contest. ""I have had to turn away almost 1,000 people. And more request keep coming in!"" George had expected a good turnout, but this was something else. Actually, the underestimation of audience interest led to the only problem of the weekend - the prejudging was held without an audience, since George did not think that enough people would be interested to justify selling tickets. But the crowd of fans, hanging outside the hall proved him wrong.  ""What happened,"" George explained, ""is that we wanted to use the main auditorium for the seminars, so we decided to use a smaller room upstairs for the prejudging. I had no idea so many people would want to see it, believe me, next year we are going to make sure that tickets to the prejudging are available. As far as I am concerned, if bodybuilding fans want something, they ought to get it. That's what makes good shows, and good shows are what we are interested in producing.""  And so the women stood before the judges and the prejudging began. Dressed in posing costumes, their full muscularity revealed to the eye, there was no doubt now that these women were, indeed, bodybuilders. They were lean and hard, and the shapeliness of their bodies came from the fullness of muscle rather than the padding of fat.  There were 21 contestants in all. Only a handful were not in top shape, and there was one competitor who had no business being in that contest. But Snyder, recognizing the nature of the contest he was presenting, had decided to be lenient in accepting entries.  ""The original idea,"" he said, ""was that an Olympia should only have contestants who had won national titles. But when I looked into it, I realized that a lot of the so-called 'national' titles some of the women had won were really just local competitions with big names - and that some of the best women bodybuilders around might be left out if we tried to be too rigid about the whole thing."" Instead, it was decided to open up the contest to professional women bodybuilders who had won a legitimate competition, and to gradually narrow the qualifications year by year as bodybuilding for women grew and contests proliferated.  ""Doing it this way,"" Snyder went on, ""is better for bodybuilding, for the women and especially for the audience, since it gives them a better show. And, let's face it; if we don't have an audience, women's bodybuilding is going nowhere. The fans are what makes the whole thing possible.""  As Christine Zane, Valerie Coe, Sven-Ole Thorson, Harold Poole, Dan Howard, Mike Katz and Doris Barrilleaux began their long day's work as judges, the seminars were getting underway downstairs. Arnold led off, discussing the psychology of bodybuilding, and was followed by Franco on injuries, Zane talking about nutrition, John Balik answering questions about steroids, and Dr. Anita Columbu discussing women's training.   Christine Zane &  Dave Draper in a rare photo.  When Arnold stood up to address the audience, it was immediately apparent how much bigger he had become, and that he must be back in serious training, But there was as yet no hint of his plans for a comeback.  Pre-Judging  Upstairs, the prejudging was proceeding according to the normal IFBB rules, identical to those used in the Mr. Olympia. There were three rounds in the afternoon: 1. Standing relaxed, viewed from all four sides;  2. Compulsory poses, six in all: two front poses, two back, arms over the head in one, lowered in the other; and two side shots, one from each side.  3. Free posing (the individual's own posing routine).  In the evening, there would be another round of free posing, and a posedown, in which each judge would pick one competitor as the winner. For each first place vote received, a competitor would have one point added to her overall score.  Rachel McLish appeared to be the immediate front-runner. This was only her third contest, but she had won impressively in the Atlantic City competition earlier in the year, did well in the Zane contest, and now looked even better in Philadelphia. It was by no means a sure thing, but there was no doubt that she was the one to beat.  Some of the best-known women were, unfortunately, not in their best shape. Patsy Chapman displayed beautiful shape and proportion as usual, but she was way too smooth. Stacey Bentley was also not as cut up as she had been at the Zane contest. ""I guess I've just tried to enter too many contests in a row, do too many exhibitions, and stay in training too long,"" she admitted later. ""I've seen it happen to the men, and now I know it can happen to me, too.""  A quiet, unobtrusive photographer, armed only with two very small, old fashioned Leicas, took shots continuously. This was George Butler, who had shot the photographs for the book version of Pumping Iron. At Philadelphia, he was taking pictures for an updated version that will include woman's bodybuilding. When the prejudging concluded, it was pretty clear how the battle for first was shaping up. Rachel McLish, no doubt, was a top contender. But she was getting some close competition from a petite blond dynamo named Auby Paulick, who was experiencing her first national level contest. That night, the auditorium of the Sheraton in Philadelphia filled up early for the banquet. Among the hundreds of diners, the competitors say and (most) ate sparingly. In a short time, they would be called backstage to get ready and the show would begin.  After dinner, the audience was treated to a number of guest posers. Ron Teufel got a warm welcome, and came out looking perhaps a little better than he would at the Mr. America a week later. Mike Mentzer appeared, thick as a house. Frank Zane looked somewhat drawn and tired, a result of a training accident in early August.  The high point of the exhibitions was, to my mind, the dual posing routine of Boyer and Valerie Coe. For one thing, Boyer was in phenomenal shape, keeping to his timetable that called for him to peak for the Mr. Olympia. But more than that, there was the excellence of the routine itself: a combination of athletic and aesthetic elements that few men and women teams have achieved.  It was like a pairs skating routine, with Boyer displaying power and athleticism in a number of well-executed lifts, and Valerie flowing with his movements as if she were unconfined by gravity. Now it was time for the show itself. Back in the small dressing rooms, unlike at the men's events, the women were cheerful and bubbling. No drawn faces and withdrawn personalities here. Just some nervous anticipation, a lot of excitement, and competitors pitching in to apply oil to the nearest back.  The Final Showdown  Auby took the stage the way Patton took Sicily. She sent beams of energy into the audience, and the people responded with by far the most enthusiasm of the evening. Auby, it turns out, had had considerable experience as a professional dancer back in her native Michigan, and she is no stranger to playing to crowds. If the contest were to have been decided purely on the basis of audience response to this last round, she would have emerged the clear winner.  Second competitor out was Anniqa Fors, a beautiful blonde Danish girl and discovered by Sven-Ole Thorsen. Anniqa is really just a beginner at bodybuilding but she showed enormous potential. Later we saw Corinne Machado, who showed such quality of development that it was certain she would place well; and then there was Auby Paulick.  It was almost unfair to ask Lynn Conkwright to follow such an act, but if somebody had to do it, she was a good choice. Lynn has such enormous strength and control of her body, she's able to do things in her posing routine that many others cannot, and the audience quickly caught on and gave her their arrival.  Then Rachel McLish came out. Her routine was careful and precise, well though out, but it lacked something - perhaps a certain dynamism, the right kind of energy. It seemed a bit too ""ladylike."" But at the same time, the quality of her physique was unmistakable, so perhaps the routine served its purpose. ""What a thoroughbred!"" Mike Mentzer said in admiration, and that about sums it up.  And The Winner Is...  After all the contestants had completed their posing routines, the top five were called out for a posedown: Rachel McLish, Auby Paulick, Lynn Conkwright, Corinne Machado and Stacey Bentley. If the contest was close, this was a chance for the competitors to make up the difference, and they worked as hard as any lineup of male professionals. And then we got the judge's decision. The winner was Rachel, followed by Auby, Lynn, Corinne and Stacey. It was over. The first Ms. Olympia had been awarded.  Many in the audience were surprised that Auby Paulick hadn't won. After all the spectators hadn't seen the prejudging, so they could only go on what had happened onstage during the evening show. And Auby had clearly dominated that aspect of the show as far as the crowd as concerned. But if we take a closer look at the scoring for all three rounds i becomes apparent what happened. The scoring in the prejudging for Rachel and Auby went like this:  NameRound 1Round 2Round 3TotalRachel McLish989999296Auby Paulick919799286 Notice that, as the rounds progressed, Auby got better and better scores. The reason for this is obvious. Rachel possessed the superior physique. Standing relaxed, it was obvious. When they did their compulsory poses, however, and Auby was able to move, she scored better. When the third round came, and she could use her own posing routine, her score was the equal of Rachel's In the final round at the evening show, not all the judges participated, so the highest possible score was 80 rather than 100. This is how the scoring went:  NameRound 4First Place Votes TotalRachel McLish794379Auby Paulick793368  Once again, Auby tied Rachel, but she was too far behind to win even if all seven judges had voted for her. but the question in the audience would have asked is why Auby, who got such a great response from the crowd, didn't score higher than Rachel?  ""Auby did a fantastic job of entertaining the audience"", one judge told me (a judge, incidentally, who gave Auby one of her first place votes), ""but we weren't there to judge a popularity contest. A lot of what she did onstage had nothing to do with bodybuilding. But, as far as presenting her physique was concerned, I thought she did well and I scored her pretty high. Although Rachel didn't come on to the audience the way Auby did, she also presented her physique well, and I scored her high, too."" Rachel, it seemed, showed an attachment to her ballet training, and may have approached her posing from somewhat too conservative an angle. But this was only her third contest, so she will no doubt develop new routines in the future.  Auby had admittedly not been training very long, and has never trained consistently heavy enough to develop a full muscular shape like Rachel. But the development she has already achieved indicates she had extraordinary potential. If she keeps it up, she had a great future in bodybuilding.  Rachel and Auby are both attractive, charismatic, and are good representatives of the sport. But it speaks well for the Ms. Olympia contest, the judges involved and women's bodybuilding as a whole that, when it came down to the wire, the best physique won the day. When that happens, everybody wins; when it doesn't, we all lose. Thanks,"

Giving Birth To A Better Body — The Belly-Banishing Fitness Plan
See how after having her fourth son, Suz made a personal pact to take her body from low self-esteem to lean in just 12 weeks!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/from-lazy-suzanne-to-wonder-mom.html,"Vital StatsName: Suzanne Michelle Reinhold Email: antvindomnoa4@gmail.com Bodyspace: antvindomnoa4           Before:  Age: 36 Height: 5'2"" Weight: 196 lbs    After:  Age: 36 Height: 5'2"" Weight: 148 lbs  Why I Got StartedAfter the birth of my fourth son, and I knew I wasn't going to have any more children, so I set a goal for myself to lose all the weight I had gained during my pregnancies and to tone up my body.  I was fed up with being a fat and unhealthy mom, I was tired of being tired and cranky all the time. I was always depressed, my self-esteem was incredibly low as was my self-worth! I never wanted to do anything, never wanted to go anywhere, life just sucked. There just had to be more to life than what I was living. That's why in October of 2010 (3 months after the birth of my 4th son) I made a pact with myself to become healthy and fit and to live my life to the fullest every single day.  I realized that I deserved to be healthy and happy, and my children deserved to have a happy, energetic and healthy mom too. I found Bodybuilding.com, read some of the other members stories and saw their transformations, and I thought ""This is just the site for me!"" So, I became a member and created my BodySpace account. Click To Enlarge.I realized that I deserved to be healthy and happy, and my children deserved to have a happy, energetic and healthy mom too.How I Did It Well, first I started by joining the YMCA. A new location had just opened up in my small town in November of 2010. Then, slowly but surely I started changing my eating habits and what types of food I ate. I didn't go gung-ho though. I just focused on one thing at a time. I didn't want to go crazy and start changing everything at once because I would have set myself up for disaster and failure. So, I slowly started cutting out really bad and worthless carbs (bread, cereal, white rice, potatoes, starches, sweets, pastries, etc). I started eating more veggies (which I love) and eating them more often throughout the day.  I also eliminated Diet Coke and started drinking more water. I've never been a water drinkerso this was a challenge for me. However, I purchased a water bottle from Bodybuilding.com and started filling it up several times a day  and NOW I never leave home without it.I wasn't familiar with the machines at the Y and how to use them, so I was a little apprehensive and ""shy"" at first. I just kind of watched everyone else and just followed along aimlessly. It wasn't until December 2010 that I signed up to meet with a personal trainer. That was probably one of the BEST things I ever did! My personal trainer explained everything to me (weight loss, muscle building, cardio, etc.). When I told him I wanted to burn fat, gain nice lean muscle and tone he went right to work. He came up with a specialized program geared just for me. He helped me find out what my 1 RM was and how to use that to challenge myself further.  Then, with my new knowledge, I decided to join the Bodybuilding.com $100,000 Body Transformation Competition on December 29th. This day was the changing point in my life, this is the day that I really became serious about my weight and wanting to lose it. With the program my personal trainer came up with for me, I was able to shed almost 30 pounds and a lot of inches within 8 weeks. I work out 6 nights a week, taking off one day for rest.  Once I set my mind to be fit and healthy, everything else just fell into place. I work a full time job during the day and have 4 children to take care of when I come home. So, most of the time I don't get to the gym until 8 p.m. and don't get back home until 10 p.m. Yes, I'm exhaustedbut my determination is so strong that I push through the exhaustion to keep going.  Now that I see I can literally change my life and my body, I don't ever want to go back to living the way I did in the past. So, I just keep moving forward!Click To Enlarge.

Printable Page PDF DocumentSuggestions for Others My suggestion to others is don't give up! There have been so many times I just wanted to give up and say forget it. But, I kept going and now I'm amazed at how far I've come and how much I have accomplished. If this is what I can do in just 12 weeks, imagine what I can do in another 12 weeks. Keep your head up. Read other success stories on Bodybuilding.com. You will truly be inspired and so incredibly motivated to get up, get moving and keep going. Don't give into excuses! There are so many excuses I could have used (I'm tired, I have 4 kids and don't have time, I don't feel like it, it's not helping because I don't see results) but I crushed them, put them out of my head and just decided to get up and go to the gym. I felt so much better afterward and was glad I went instead of staying home and being a couch potato. Start off slow at first and work yourself up. Don't try to eliminate all your bad habits at once. Start with one bad habit (i.e. unhealthy eating, or becoming more active) and work on that. Once you've accomplished kicking that bad habit, move onto the next one.Use the power of positive thinking. Tell yourself everyday that you are worth it, you are beautiful, you are strong, you are amazing, you are healthy, you're losing weight and becoming healthy. It really works.  The mind is a powerful thing and when you start reprogramming it with positive thoughts instead of negative thoughts everything in your life will be more positive![ View Other Transformations ]You Could Be Our Next Transformation Of The Week!

7 Postnatal Exercises For New Moms
Regaining your post-baby body after giving birth will take some time. Do yourself a favor and start off on the right foot. Here are some safe, smart exercises you can implement right away!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/7-postnatal-exercises-for-new-moms.html,"Vital Stats Name: Kelly Rennie Occupation: Transformation specialist, author of the Fit Mummy Manual, Optimum Nutrition athlete.  Website: kellyrennie.comHaving two kids in two years definitely put a strain on my body. Like a lot of moms, I wanted to start working toward my pre-baby shape as soon as I could. The trouble is, there's a lot of misinformation out there about how long a woman has to wait before she can start being active again. Some people say six weeks; others say three months.I get asked all the time if there's anything a woman can do to start regaining her figure in the first few weeks after giving birth. The real answer is yes. For most women, it is safe and healthy to do some gentle exercise a few weeks after giving birth.*However, the type of exercises you do in the first few weeks after your baby is born should be focused on your pelvic floor and transverse abdominus (TVA). Your pelvic floor is made of muscles and tissue under the pelvis. It's the part of your body that helped your baby rotate and come through the birth canal. The TVA is your innermost abdominal muscle. It's one of the muscles that helped you give birth.The basics of pelvic-floor exercises and TVA breathing are a must. These techniques are a bridge to your normal exercise regimen. These exercises will also help you heal from the inside out, repairing those inner abdominal walls that are crucial to regaining your figure.Aside from giving you a running start toward your pre-baby figure, exercising soon after giving birth offers other benefits. Exercise can boost your mood, help you feel more energized, increase your stamina and strength, and make you feel healthier and happier.SAFE POST-BABY ABDOMINAL WORKOUTSThese exercises focus on restoring the timing and sequencing of your deep muscles, which include TVA, multifidus (small, thin muscles deep in your sacrum), the pelvic floor, and the diaphragm to flatten the tummy faster.For first few days or weeks post-birth, you may not feel your pelvic floor muscles working, but keep going. The feeling will return after a few days.For first few days or weeks post-birth, you may not feel your pelvic floor muscles working, but keep going. The feeling will return after a few days. Trust me, those muscles are working, even if you can't feel them.Workout 1   TVA/Pelvic Floor Activation 10 sets of 10 seconds To engage the TVA and pelvic floor, start by taking a breath in through your nose. Then, as your breathe out through pursed lips, ""lift up"" at your bottom, as if you were trying to stop yourself from passing wind. Next, as you're still tensed at the back, ""pull up"" at the front, as if trying to stop yourself from urinating. Keep the tension going, and gently draw your navel toward your back.   Mini-Crunch1 set of 10-15 reps This is not a full sit-up or crunch. Simply lift your head from the floor a little, and focus on engaging the TVA.   Superman1 set of 10-15 reps Lie on your stomach and make sure your lower back and hips are in a stable position. Reach your arms forward and stretch your legs out. From this position, lift your arms and legs up 2-3 inches off the ground. Hold for 3-5 seconds, and release back down to the ground.   Assisted Heel Drop1 set of 10 reps per leg Lie on your back. There should be a small space between your lower back and the floor. Pull your belly button into your spine and lift your knees. From this position, lower one heel until it touches the ground, then pull it back up. Repeat with the alternate leg.// <![CDATA[quickstart_training_white(""Workout 1"",""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/printlog2.php?Exercise%5B%5D=TVA/Pelvic+Floor+Activation:+10+sets+of+10+seconds&Sets%5B%5D=10&Exercise%5B%5D=Mini-Crunch:+1+set+of+10-15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=1&Exercise%5B%5D=Superman:+1+set+of+10-15+reps&Sets%5B%5D=1&Exercise%5B%5D=Assisted+Heel+Drop:+1+set+of+10+reps+per+leg&Sets%5B%5D=1&TotalExercises=4&mood=yes&weight=yes&cardio=yes&location=yes&length=yes&comments=yes&instruct=yes&firstname=Post+Natal+Ab+Workout&name=Workout+1"");// ]]>Printable PagePDF DocumentWorkout 2   TVA/Pelvic Floor Activation 10 sets of 10 seconds  (See description above.)

Put tension on the band by making sure your hands are slightly wider than shoulder-width. Slightly bend your elbows. Pinch your shoulder blades together until your forearms are perpendicular to your body. Release, then repeat. Focus on breathing out as you pull the band wide and engage your TVA and pelvic floor.

Hormonal Timing Program: Women's Fitness Evolved!
I had just given birth to twins by C-section...  My body was stretched out, fat, and disgusting! The following program is designed specifically for women who are fighting the hormone battle while trying to get fit! Take control now, right here!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/hormonal_timing_program.htm,"Are Your HORMONES Keeping You FAT?  Over the past 5 years I've experimented with a training strategy designed for women only. My goal was to create the fastest possible method for women to achieve radical physical transformation. I believed the key was to capitalize on the positive effects of our hormonal fluctuations while also diminishing the negative effects.  I used myself as my first test patient. I had just given birth to twins by C-section which were my 3rd and 4th babies in less than 4 years. My body was stretched out, fat, depleted in every way and just plain disgusting.  At the time, I just wanted to see radical transformation in my body. I had no idea that I was on the verge of discovering something that would change the lives of thousands of women. To make a long story short, my body transformed radically by using what I now call Hormonal Timing  .  Click To Enlarge.Michelle Berger's Transformation.View Her BodySpace Here. I began designing custom Hormonal Timing programs for women online. I charged $1200.00 for an 8 week program. It wasn't long before I was sold out! I simply didn't have time to take on any more clients. The results my clients were experiencing were amazing and I soon realized that I had to develop a way to share this amazing program with every woman in the world, so I wrote a book!  Here is an excerpt exclusively available on Bodybuilding.com.  Hormonal Timing: Female Fitness Evolved By BuffMother! Author Michelle Berger  Foundation #1:Realize That You Are in a Battle!  I'm sure you've felt it: that sudden lack of ambition that just seems to overcome you. You might say, ""This time I'm going to stick to my plan!"" And you do for a while, but then you suddenly realize that you've been slacking for the last 5 days! What happened? You then blame yourself thinking, ""I don't have any self-discipline, self-control, motivation, etc..."" You feel guilty about your lack of willpower.  Maybe you feel like you're close to reaching your goals but just can't quite get there. You work so hard but when you look in the mirror you are always disappointed! You constantly ask yourself, ""What am I doing wrong""? What am I missing?!?  The fact is the vast majority of us have a personal battle going on inside. It may be about your diet, exercise habits, smoking, drinking, scale/weight, dress size, etc.  Every woman's battle is unique but while we fight against all these ""visible enemies,"" an invisible enemy comes along and defeats us. It's our HORMONES! Our hormones are the invisible enemy, and it's time that we learn how to fight back.

""Millions of women fail to reach their diet and fitness goals simply due to their hormones."" This affliction is called Hormone-Induced Failure (HIF) and it will sabotage your success unless you're prepared. I believe that HIF is a huge problem in America!   Are You A Victim Of HIF: Hormone-Induced Failure?   Answer these 4 questions to find out if you have Hormone-Induced Failure:  Are you a habitual yo-yo dieter?Do you periodically suffer from uncontrollable cravings that sabotage your efforts to lose weight?Do you start exercise programs and then quit for no apparent reason?Do you ever suffer sudden weight gain that makes you want to quit trying?Do you catch yourself saying things like, ""I have no willpower"" or ""I'm just not motivated...""? In my experience, most women answer yes to many of the above questions. Most women blame themselves but YOU must understand, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!!  Hormone-Induced Failure (HIF) is to blame!!  Hormones Control Your Diet & Fitness Success!  FACT: Your appetite, cravings, motivation level, mood, energy level, water weight, belly bloat and metabolism are controlled by your hormones!

Hormones Control Your Appetite (Junk Food Cravings):  Do you have those days when you just wanna eat? I mean really ""pig out,"" on things like doughnuts, cookies, chips, chocolate, etc? It is a sad-but-true fact that our hormones cause us to DESIRE these items.  Click To Enlarge.Our Hormones Cause These Desires. Specifically during the time of the month when your concentrations of hormones are at their highest, you will desire quick easy sources of carbohydrates (carbs), the easiest source being junk food. These carbs spike the secretion of serotonin, your ""feel good"" hormone so-too-often you find your cravings seem out of control.  What can you do to avoid this? Simply, having a plan to eat enough healthy carbs really helps keep your cravings under control, and supplementing your diet with the proper vitamins and nutrients can help your cravings diminish.

[ Top Vitamin Categories! ]    Hormones Control Your Motivation Level & Mood (Mentality)!  The psychological affects of hormones are well documented. According to the Mayo Clinic, there are many symptoms of hormone imbalances including anger, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, irritability, tension and more. An imbalance in hormone levels may cause you to feel sad, lonely, apathetic, self-critical, and unsure of yourself. Just a little bit of being ""down"" can wreak havoc on your diet and fitness efforts.  My motivation to accomplish anything, especially anything hard, often disappears during the second half of my cycle. When I hit day 22 of my cycle, my reason behind working out or dieting gets lost. I say to myself, ""Why am I doing this? I don't want to!"" I also find myself taking less time out for my other needs.  Even simple things like doing my hair, nails, shaving, and putting on make up, become difficult and a pain. Personally, I was never a consistent exerciser until I was aware of my own hormonal lack of motivation, or HIF, and took action against it.  On the positive side of things, the instant your hormones drop, signaling your body to menstruate, your motivation will begin to rise again... and after a couple days you will feel powerful and ready to conquer mountains. This powerful feeling typically continues until a few days after ovulation and when you will feel the ""lazy bug"" hit again.

Learn more about this normal biological function of the female body and how research has changed our perception of this condition.   Author: Shannon Clark  This is when you may fall off your fitness/diet program. Time and time again I have had clients, friends and family who literally ""fall off the face of the earth"" at this high hormone time of the month. This is classic Hormone Induced Failure (HIF).   Hormones Control Your Energy Level & Sleep Patterns:  Do you have days where you are just dragging, limp and lifeless? Yet you can't figure out why? Hormones control your energy levels. Based upon the balance of your hormones in your body your energy levels may be high or low.  Each month, energy levels rise and fall according to the balance of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in your system. If a you are unaware of this cycle when you hit a low energy phase you may think you are just being wimpy, not eating enough, getting sick, etc. BUT, if you know that your low energy is caused by your hormones you will be able to utilize my program to prevent these low-energy days, or at least get through them without beating yourself up about it and losing all momentum. You will be able to honestly tell yourself, I am tired just because of my hormones and tomorrow I will be fine.  As your hormone levels rise toward the end of each month, your sleep may be disturbed, causing energy during the day to be scarce. Often times simply allowing yourself more rest or a nap during this time of the month is all you need to be happier, healthier, and consistent in your fitness efforts.

Hormones Control Water Weight Gain And Belly Bloat:  Oh man! This can be bad!! As a woman, the scale is not your friend for several days of the month. No matter how perfect you may be in your diet and exercise, the scale has a mind of its own when hormones run high.  Your rising hormone levels will cause you to retain water toward the end of each monthly cycle. This is part of why you appear ""soft"" in comparison to a man. Your natural sex hormones help keep your skin full and plump, which is all fine and dandy, until it holds onto 3 pounds more than just the day earlier and fluffs you up so much that your pants don't button!  Click To Enlarge.Author, Michelle ""BuffMother"" Berger. Water retention doesn't just happen in one localized part of your body - it affects your face, hands, feet, belly, butt, etc. Another nasty result of water retention is that our cellulite looks even more dramatic at this time of the month. I point out to my clients that I can actually ""see"" the hormones in them - it is visible as ripples due to hormone metabolites (toxins), especially in the hips, legs and abdomen.  As you become leaner, you will experience greater water weight fluctuations because muscle cells hold a lot more water than fat cells. Don't lose heart when this happens!! It is actually a good sign that you are headed in the right direction with your body composition.   Hormones Control Your Metabolism:  As you go through the month, your hormones effect your metabolism (the rate at which your body burns calories). Documented studies show you can actually burn up to an extra 500 calories per day during the week prior to your period. NO WONDER you feel like you want to eat everything in sight!

Your body is telling you that you need the extra energy. Why then do you feel horribly guilty if you eat a bit more? Probably because you are already bloated and feel frustrated, so eating extra food seems like the worst thing to do.  Don't let guilt turn your fitness quest upside down. Accept that fact that you may need a few more calories right now, plan for that, and enjoy your indulgence. This will enable you to end the cycle of guilty binges and emotional eating before they start. As a result you will build your fitness momentum instead of quitting due to Hormone Induced Failure!   Hormones Control Many Other Aspects That Affect Your Body & Life:   The list of other ways hormones affect you is long but here are a few: digestive issues, allergies, etc. I've personally been concerned about these symptoms from time to time. However after, I connected these symptoms to my hormones, I was free from worry because I knew, ""It's just my hormones.""  Click To Enlarge.Author, Michelle ""BuffMother"" Berger. Every woman is a bit different in regards to her biggest hormonal struggle. But no matter what, there are effects from your hormones--good ones and bad ones--and they must be considered in your diet and fitness program.  The key point to know is that there are nutrients, mental strategies, and physical fitness/diet applications that will help prevent or minimize the bad effects and allow you to capitalize on the good effects.  As you apply the diet, exercise and supplementation principles of my program you will establish consistency which will lead to progressively gaining momentum month after month.

Art Of Figure Presentation: It's All In The Details!
I first started exercising seriously after the birth of my beautiful daughter. I immediately fell in love! Once I did my first figure show, I was hooked! Here are some proven tips for figure success!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/figure_competition_prep.htm,"Article Summary: The NPC has very particular criteria on how to present your physique. A good posing suit will flow with the lines of your body. Be sure to hit the tanning salon regularly as contest time nears.  The Art Of Figure Presentation:It's All In The Details  I first started exercising seriously after the birth of my beautiful daughter, Alexis, to get back in shape. Although I was a recreational athlete in high school, (I did cheer and gymnastics for most of my childhood) I never got very competitive at it. Regardless, I really enjoyed the physical activity and my body responded quickly to the change.  Once I did my first figure show, I was hooked! My first few shows, I did well, with little knowledge of what the sport was really about. I laugh now, because for my very first show, I knew nothing about preparation or presentation.  When they lined us up, ready to go onstage, I simply copied the moves of the girl in front of me! My suit was way too big for me! (I had ordered it online and it just didn't fit properly - kept riding up my bum and I knew nothing about bikini bite!). One thing I will say, though, is that I always had the best color! I learned early on that a good tan was of the utmost importance!  One of the first role models for me early in my career was Japanese IFBB Pro Masae Tagami. She and I trained at the same gym for a time. I learned a lot from her. I would watch everything she did onstage and tried to mirror her.  Click Image To Enlarge.Masae Tagami At The 2008 California State Pro.View More Pics Of Masae Tagami At The 2008 California State Pro. To me, she was so beautiful to watch on the stage. Her make-up always seemed perfect, her walk, her movements, her presentation and overall appearance was so polished and classy next to the other girls, it set her apart. I tried to emulate her. I realized very quickly that presentation is arguably the biggest part of our sport.  One of our local NPC judges, whose opinion I have come to respect over the years, once told me, ""The best physique doesn't always win, Meriza. Especially in figure, if you cannot present yourself properly on stage, it will hurt you in the eyes of the judges."" I thought about this for a long time.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  This Is How I Did It!   Figure for me really started as a hobby. However, in the past two years I have been able to take it to a whole new level!   Author: M. DeGuzman  After watching enough shows, I really started to see the importance of being able to stand properly, turn gracefully, twist and smile with ease, and be able to walk with confidence (especially in those tall shoes!). Poise, polish and presentation - these are the keys to keep in mind to succeed in our sport.   The Turns     In figure, we don't really have ""poses"". There is no ""front double biceps"" pose or ""side chest"" pose, like in bodybuilding. For figure, our judging round consists simply of 4 ""quarter-turns"", and 4 model turns.   The quarter-turns are mandatory turns or body positions you assume in order for the judges to compare you to the girl standing next to you, and to the rest of your competitors.  Click Image To Enlarge.Our Judging Consists Of 4Quarter-Turns & 4 Model Turns.  The model turns are variations of the quarter-turns, involve one hand on the hip during both side positions, with a slight twist to the torso, and a more side-ways presentation to the physique. The model turns are a little more individualized, but still follow a particular format.   The National Physique Committee (NPC) has very particular criteria on how to present your physique correctly, so that all competitors appear in a similar posture, for easier comparisons.

You spend countless hours doing  cardio,  weight training,  eating,  supplementing, doing all the things you need to do to get into competition condition, don't make the mistake of choosing a poorly cut or improperly fitting suit!   Suits are expensive, for sure, but a good suit will flow with the lines of your body. The cut of your suit can accentuate a tiny waist, for example, or hide a blocky mid-section; the right cut can create the illusion of longer legs, or a tapered waist.  Click Image To Enlarge.Your Suit Can Make Or Break You.  And let's not forget the color! Be sure to choose a color that accentuates your complexion. Fairer-skinned girls should stick with darker hues or more subtle colors - that seems to work well (pastels can be tough to pull of with lighter skin tones); ladies with a darker complexion can often pull off a wider variety of colors.   I have all of my suits custom made these days by Bryon David. He's local, but he's the best. He makes suits for all of the top girls. You can contact me for his information. There are several really good custom suit makers out there.  One suggestion is to study your physique, and compare it to experienced girls you admire who have similar structure. Observe the cut and shape of their suits, and be aware of these variables as you work with your suit-maker.

Many girls hire a hairstylist the day of the show to take some of the  stress out of creating a polished look. I used to simply pull my hair back into a ponytail, but I soon learned that overlooking something as apparent as a hairstyle does not help me in any way.   It's the same with makeup. Realize that figure is a stage show. Be sure to apply your make up more heavily and more dramatically for the show. Again, under the stage lights, normal, everyday makeup will not show effectively.  As for accessories, the NPC has specific dos and don'ts regarding jewelry. Be sure to check with your sanctioning organization for rules regarding accessories, too. And, don't forget them!

I had a teacher who really liked the way I lead classes and encouraged me to start teaching. My junior year I started teaching aerobics classes at a local gym. After I graduated I went into the military. I worked in the Health and Wellness Center doing body composition assessments, nutrition training, and teaching classes. I was medically discharged from the military because I started having seizures. I moved to Florida, got married, bought a house, and then got pregnant a year later. It was a difficult transition and happened very fast. I totally let myself go, especially during pregnancy. When I was pregnant with my son I stopped weighing once I reached 200 pounds. I felt horrible, I had no confidence, and I vowed that as soon as I had my son I was going to get healthy and stay that way. I was determined.    The power potential inside her just needed to be released!How I Did ItAfter my son was born my husband was deployed. I went to Washington to stay with my parents. I joined a gym and started working out. I had that ""I know everything"" mentality so I didn't hire a trainer.After a little while I caved and decided it couldn't hurt. I hired an amazing trainer who pushed me and encouraged me to also become a trainer. I had always wanted to be a trainer and I'll never forget her encouraging words telling me to do it. I went home that night and bought the study materials. I had lost all my baby weight but I wasn't satisfied. I went home and shocked my husband with the new me. Eventually I started teaching mommy-and-me classes in the park, training in people's homes, and training at the YMCA. During this time I took up running.I was never a good runner but it was something I wanted to conquer. I trained diligently and it wasn't long before I ran my first 5K. I was hooked. I loved the environment of races and the thrill. I did several more races and decided I needed more of a challenge. This is when I trained for my first  marathon. I had great running partners to keep me accountable. I ran my first half marathon and said I would never do it again. A month or so later I was presented with the chance to help raise money for The Parent Project for Muscular Dystrophy for one of my client's sons. I decided to do the Goofy. This was a  marathon on Saturday and a full marathon on Sunday in Disney. I completed it with one of my very good friends. It was an amazing experience! After that I needed a new goal. I was getting burnt out on running.  I always wanted to do a figure competition but I never thought I could, especially after having my son and all the stretch marks I had. I found an awesome company to help coach me and was surprised to find out that the tan is so dark you don't even see stretch marks on stage. I competed in both figure and bikini. I won 1st place in figure and 5th in bikini. It was also an incredible experience. Since then I have been running my personal training business and pursuing fitness modeling!

People are roaring to go when they start a new program and many times they start off doing way too much and burn out or they injure themselves. Don't be so hard on yourself. Take everything on day at a time, shoot, even one hour at a time. Remember where you started and how far you've come. Don't forget how you felt when you were miserable, lacking confidence, and dying for a change. Don't forget how excited you were to get your health back. Remember when an exercise kicks your butt. If you hit a road block or have to go through a tough time, remember it. When you remember these things it will stop you from going back to that place. Let those hard times motivate you and inspire you to push forward. Set BIG goals. You will never accomplish anything in life if you don't try to tackle things that scare you. Be accountable. When I told the world I was going to compete that solidified it. Post pictures, share your success, and DON'T pull away from the people who are holding you accountable when you go through a struggle. Reach out.Celebrate your victories - I don't care if its one pound, a pants size, a lower cholesterol reading, or an extra push up. Take the time to celebrate it instead of being so focused on what's next. You Could Be Our Next Transformation Of The Week Male Transformations.

Female Transformation Of The Week - Lara Bross.
Lara didn't realize her body had turned soft until after the birth of her son. Learn more about her amazing transformation as she goes on to lose almost 30 pounds and 20% body fat!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/transf124.htm,"Before:  140 lbs  After:  117 lbs  Vital Stats  Name: Lara Bross Email: lara.bross@comcast.net  Before: Weight: 140 lbs Body Fat: 32%  After: Weight: 117 lbs Body Fat: approx. 10%  Why I Got Started  It was after my son's birth and I was feeling like I had gotten a bit soft. Then, my mom and everyone on her side of the family suddenly started having health problems. My risk factors for some of these health problems, due to family history, startled me into thinking that I was a ticking time bomb.  To top it off, my husband remarked that my butt was getting big! When I had my body fat measured and my ""Before"" picture taken and shown to me, I realized I HAD to do something. I knew I had gotten soft but I really had no idea that I was overweight and out of shape.  How I Did It  I got a personal trainer and started making exercise a habit. After six months though, I noticed I wasn't really seeing much of a change. It was only when I took charge of my diet and cut out processed foods, lowered my carbohydrates, and increased my protein did I see my body begin to change. I lost most of the weight in the next six months and I started building muscle and I liked how it looked.  I had always dreamed of competing but never thought I'd really be able to. Once I dropped my weight, I started thinking about it more. I checked out a show and I was hooked. Around this time, we nearly lost my mother (at 60!) and I started thinking life is just too short. I knew if I was ever going to do it, the time had come.  While training for competition, I surprisingly found that the affects of having tangible goals and feeling great physically, spilled over into other parts of my life: I found self-determination and passion for life - I was smiling and joking more, I was more organized, etc. This discovery helped me decide others could benefit from this spillover effect, so I got certified as Personal Trainer last year.  Click To Enlarge.Lara Bross. In Sept of '05, I tore my ACL and had back-to-back surgeries for my ACL and a hernia repair. Once I recovered from the surgeries, I started training with IFBB pro, Rashid ""Roc"" Shabazz. With Roc's help and lots of hard work and dieting, I placed first in Master's class in August of '06 at the NPC Coastal show. I competed at the Jr. USA in '07 and hope to do one more national-level show with a Master's class this year.  Click To Enlarge.Rashid ""Roc"" Shabazz. Supplements  I use Isopure No Carb protein powder, glutamine, and Branched-Chain Amino Acids to help build muscle and also retain it when dieting for a show.

Saturday - Rest   Sunday - Cardio Only  Stretching for 10 minutes after each weight training session  Suggestions For Others  Consistency is key - you should not expect instant results, but if you keep at it the results will happen and you can reach your goals. Think of it like needlepoint - each stitch doesn't add much, but over time you will see a bigger picture starting to emerge.  Clean up the diet! The biggest factor to changing your body's appearance is DIET. You can work out all you want, but you won't see the muscle if it is covered by a layer of fat. Eating clean and eating often supports a healthy metabolism and puts you in fat loss mode!  A positive mental attitude affects everything!! Stress can mess up all your hard work, so make sure to find ways to keep it maintained. Take it one minute/one rep at a time when things get hard. Make sure to SMILE and have FUN!

Transformation Of The Week - Chell; AKA - BomChell.
After giving birth to so many children one can only wonder how they keep their sanity. Well I suppose the only way to put it is ... you do what you have to do. Some love it, some don't. Here is Chell's story.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/trans35.htm,"Before: Weight: 231 August 3, 2004  After: Weight: 152 Lbs August 3rd, 2005  Why You Got Started?  On August 3, 2004, I weighed 231 pounds, pregnant with my sixth child. She was born August 20 leaving me to lose roughly 70 pounds. The after photo above, taken exactly one year later, weighed me at 152 pounds. In talking to women they often say, ""I look this way because I have had a couple of children."" I would respond: ""Well I have had 5 and adopted one.""  They would ask me how I do it working a full-time job of supporting two teams: 1)IT LAN Help Desk and 2) a production environment working in excess of 50-to-60 hours a week. All the while, volunteering to be the President of our neighborhood pool and managing my own; likewise, volunteering to manage the daycare for our church.  Click To Enlarge.Chell, Mother Of Six. When exercising I found it most valuable to do any cardio 1st thing in the morning before you eat anything. Your body tends to burn 3 times the fat as your glycemic rate stabilized while you were sleeping. (A cup of coffee or tea is OK; it will actually help you get moving faster.) If you cannot do that, then try not to eat an hour or two before you work out; otherwise, you are not really burning fat.  Likewise, it is best not to eat any carbs prior to going to bed. You will not burn them off and will probably be stored as fat. Which I might add if you need to have a little treat, do it first thing in the morning so you have all day to burn it off.  How You Did It?  Once I delivered Cydnee (8-20-04), I was so overweight my knees and the arches on my feet were extremely sore. Since I gained so much weight, partially due to my food intake and partially due to the prednizone I had to take to control the lupus anticoagulant I carry. The anticoagulant can form blood clots that could harm the fetus.  Click To Enlarge.After I Delivered Cydnee. The lesson I learned as I try to get back into shape was I could no longer do what I used to. I had to reassure myself that doing a little was worth it and just try to do a little every day. Unfortunately this was my fourth C-section in which my doctor strongly recommended I wait at least three months to do any weightlifting.  Right after delivery I started walking, then I moved on to light weights while slowly increasing the intensity. I cut out all fast food. I increased my protein levels (tuna, turkey, lean meats, chicken, egg whites and whey protein). Even boiling some of the meats like hamburger and steak to remove the extra grease.  Next I cut down on the sugar carbs (desserts, processed foods such as cereals, bread, bagels and noodles). Good carbs are most green vegetables, brown rice, yams and oatmeal. At health stores it is possible to find cereals and noodles that are lower in sugar carbs. You may pay a little more, however, it is really worth it.  Click To Enlarge.Low Sugar Carbs Are Worth The Expense. You do need to treat yourself once in a while or you will fail. Good cheating things are pizza thin crust, salsa with Tostitos Scoops. They also have sugar-free carb candies and desserts. Just remember ... everything should be in moderation, as they often replace the carbs with saturated fat. Give yourself a cheat timeframe or even a day per week. Even if that means having a social cocktail. I have found drinking rum or vodka with crystal kool-aid a winner. Zero carbs.   What Supplements Did You Take?    Just a  multivitamin a day is all you really need. I bought a ton of books off the internet about supplements and vitamins. I tried them all. Some include:   Vitamin B complex Vitamin C Vitamin E Alpha Lipids Potassium Beta Carotene Glucosamine Chondroitin I never saw any significant change; therefore I researched the multivitamin and found the daily allowance to be sufficient.  I do take fat burning supplements such as Stacker II or III, Ripped Fuel, Rev xp, etc.  Favorite Foods are Wal-Mart's Chocolate Soy Slender Soy Milk, South Beaches Protein Bars, and any Frito Lay chip as they contain zero trans fat.

I found my workouts are more consistant if I set a time for it. If I say that I'm going to do, I do it. I am doing this for me and no one else.   I try to ride my mountain bike during lunches on weekdays for 40 minutes when work is not to hectic. Weekdays I lift for 30 minutes; normally one muscle group, at least 6 exercises, 3 sets, reps vary in range right now because I am trying to increase my muscle strength; I am lifting heavy reps (3-10).  Click To Enlarge.I Am Doing This For Me & No One Else. When I want to get cut, I lift less weights and increase reps with a body pump class that is always to music. On the weekends, I always workout for one hour. I also ride motocross, which I try to do once per week. This really burns calories.  The best way I have noticed in getting my legs more defined is the adductor and low squats. I know guys that think the adductor is a girly movement. However, the biggest powerlifters I have met do those. They are used in every leg movement you perform.  For biceps I like the 21s: 7 reps from bottom raise to waist, 7 reps from waist to shoulders, then 7 reps full curl.  Click To Enlarge.21's Using The Curl.

So I do squats, sissy squats, toe raisers, adductors and leg extensions while holding her. Makes great for extra weight. Good news for moms: babies usually fall asleep during the squats.  Likewise my kids sit on my lap while I place my hands on the bottom step with straight arms. Then I bend my arms and do a tricep dip. I try to include them as much as possible to make it fun plus they are always around.  Shoulder lifts I can do with my 4-year old laying across my arms and good mornings with her laying across my shoulders. Even my 14-year old wants i on this action. She will sit in my arms while I do shrugs.  Click To Enlarge.I Try To Include My Kids As Much As Possible. Abs For Women     It is more important to lift the legs up to your waist vs. crunching down. Do 2/3 more   leg ups,   Roman chair, or   windmills than anything else.     Working Out With Children   Getting back in shape after having a baby requires excellent time management! The more you can work child's play into your workout, the more time there is for everything else that needs to be taken care of during the day.

After giving birth the body needs help to restore the sexy physique that was once achieved.  Having a baby can be a lot of work. Feeding, cleaning and nurturing aside, getting your body back in shape can be one of your toughest assignments.  Workout What Is The Best Workout To Shed The Pregnancy Weight? Be Specific.  Be sure to have your diet in check and have medical clearance before starting out the weight-loss program. Eat nutritious foods every three hours for the entire time you are awake. Keep the fat intake minimal, but focus on healthy fats.  As you are nursing your baby, you don't want to lack in nutrition in the first place, and severe under-eating can also cause problems in this area. This said, do not drop caloric intake rapidly!  Now, if you haven't been active during pregnancy, don't jump right into intense workouts. But, each day, be sure to do at least something active. Starting out, going for a walk (also showing off your new baby) around the neighborhood or parks is a great way to do something. Then, start working up to faster-paced cardio exercises like jogging, swimming or cycling.  Click To Enlarge.Going For A Walk (Showing Off Your New Baby)Is A Great Way To Do Something. If you really want to control your calories, weight-training can help you build and maintain muscle, which burn calories much more than fat does and will tighten up your body. Not only that, but you may even improve your look and fitness more than it was before! I personally recommend mainly all compound exercises, which really helps overall muscle stimulation rather than certain muscle groups.  For example a sample week of weight training and cardio can be as follows:   Sunday: Rest Day:   Monday: Legs:  Lunges - 3 x 6-10Wide Stance Barbell Squat - 3 x 6-10Stiff-legged Deadlifts - 3 x 6-10Leg Extensions - 4 x 6-10Seated Calf Raise - 4 x 6-10  Click Here For A Printable Log Of Monday.

Remember, just because this workout has you doing some sort of activity each day does not mean you won't have time to take care of your baby or enjoy yourself.  Some of these days' workouts will take only 20 minutes to complete. On Saturdays, do the cardio or HIIT, but instead of abdominal exercises try to attend a yoga session. This can help not only strength and flexibility, but also can help you relax from your hectic schedule.  RELATED ARTICLE  What Is The Best Yoga Workout?   Probably everyone knows at least one person who swears by yoga. However, there are many different types of yoga to choose from.

How Long Does It Take How Long Does It Take To Shed The Weight Using This Program?  The timeframe to get your body back to your pre-pregnancy weight depends greatly on your commitment. Obviously, if you're not willing to stay true to the meal-plans and workouts, your goals won't be met nearly as fast as if you are dedicated.  Click To Enlarge.The Timeframe To Get Your Body Back To YourPre-Pregnancy Weight Depends Greatly On Your Commitment. The plan I put together for my sister took her about 8 months to get her body pretty close to what it was before pregnancy. Fortunately for her, she only gained about 25 pounds of ""pregnancy-weight,"" which helped the process not take nearly as long.  Like any ""cut"" program or weight-loss plan, do not plan on losing more than 2 pounds every week. Starting out, this will be tough to do, and more than this will put excess stress on your body (that has already gone through an ordeal) and may make it harder to maintain the weight loss.

After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries.    Author: David Robson  Bonus Question What Are The Best Supplements To Take Post Pregnancy? What Supplements Should Be Avoided?  Right after you've delivered your baby, try not to get right into supplements. Like any workout program, try to reach your goals first without help of supplements. If you find your progress is slow then read up on products you might be interested in. If you require a protein supplement, soy, hemp, wheat and whey are viable options.  If whey is your weapon of choice, be sure to use whey protein isolate for this type of program. Another reason to not rely on supplements is that you will be breast-feeding.  Artificial sweeteners found in many supplements, including proteins, might not be optimal for the baby's sake. Obviously, fat-burners and other products high in stimulants should be avoided. For the baby's safety, just play it natural starting out.  A good multivitamin is also useful for anyone on a workout program.

Pregnancy is a beautiful part of life, but it is also one of the times in a woman's life when weight gain is for all intensive purposes unavoidable.  Perhaps one of the most detrimental parts of the pregnancy emotionally can occur after the birth of the child. There you are, no longer pregnant, but with much more fatty adipose tissue than before.

How Long Does It Take How Long Does It Take To Shed The Weight Using This Program?  With the use of this program, you can lose that unwanted pregnancy weight in no time at all, assuming you have your diet in check. I've always said that in weight loss, diet is more than half of the battle, so you should absolutely check out some of the diet articles that Bodybuilding.com has to ensure proper caloric intake as well as the right types and kinds of foods for you.  Keep reading, because the more you learn about getting to that healthy weight and being able to maintain it, the better off you will be in the long run.  Keep in mind, the idea behind why this workout will work in addition to your diet is that this workout will help you build a little bit of muscle, which will increase your metabolism and multiply the effects of your cardio. This is why the people you see on the cardio machines at the gym day in and day out never lose weight; they're just burning calories as well as muscle, keeping their metabolism low and slow.  Resistance training is key in ensuring weight loss. And don't worry about putting too much muscle on, because it's a slow process and you will have time to decide if you're getting too bulky or not well in advance. Keep working hard and you can succeed before you even know it.  Bonus Question What Are The Best Supplements To Take Post Pregnancy? What Supplements Should Be Avoided?  The absolute best supplement to take post pregnancy would be whey protein. Supplementing with protein not only will help you make gains in lean muscle, it also requires more caloric input to digest, making your body burn more calories throughout the day. Now I know it may seem silly to you to be drinking a protein shake, but it really isn't as odd or out of place for woman to do that at all.  Almost all of the best female athletes out there supplement with whey protein, and don't you let anyone tell you any different. They'll be the ones envying you and your new sexy little body a couple months from now, and they will bite their tongues about how they might have criticized you about drinking protein shakes.  Definitely try out Syntrax Nectar. It's one of the best tasting protein supplements out there, or if you prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners; I'd advise trying out Optimum Nutrition's Any Whey.   RELATED PRODUCT  Syntrax Presents: Nectar   Leading scientists assessing the true role of fats in increasing lean muscle growth have shown all fats are not created equal. [ Click here to learn more. ]  On the other end of the spectrum, you don't want to be taking any supplements that could be harmful to your health. Although many other people may disagree, I wouldn't advise a person to take stimulants or fat burners post-pregnancy, especially if you're nursing the baby.  There are a number of supplements and ingredients out there that don't have tons of research backing them, and although may not be harmful to you they could be harmful to the child. Stay away from anything that your doctor says to avoid, as they know best and want you and your child to stay as healthy as possible.

Looking For The Buff Chick Within.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/par20.htm,"In my teens, I was all ""knees and elbows"". In my 20's I was obsessively thin.  At 30, after giving birth to my second child, I felt my metabolism lurch. Suddenly I couldn't eat all that I wanted and stay perfectly thin. Although I never reached the stage of being overweight, I knew that the slowing of my metabolism would not improve and I would be gaining weight for the rest of my life if I did not change something. My family told me that it was natural to gain weight in my 30's-and so it is-but I was not one to be content with developing a ""mature figure"". I bought a Tae-Bo tape, later a copy of Body-for-Life, and eventually The Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding. I joined a gym and found a veteran bodybuilder to train me.  As my body began to firm and change, I looked for information on what I should do to continue to improve and found that there was comparatively very little written on how women should train differently than men. Much of the available material discussed the socially attractive side of female fitness, the toned look. Simply ""toned"" did not seem to be what I wanted since I was already thin, but I also knew that I was not destined to look like Lenda Murray. I wanted a look between these end marks; later I realized that what I wanted to achieve was a fit, lightly muscled, but highly feminine look. My quest for knowledge has eventually been rewarded by an ever-expanding web of information, and by a vast amount of self-discovery.  Check Out Dozens Of Female Training Articles, Click Here!  As my body has developed, so has much more. The gaining of strength in my arms and my legs is proportional to an increase in strength of mind and spirit. Strangely, for me, the biggest reward of bodybuilding, has ultimately come down to increased confidence as manifested in not only physical power, but also in increased control of my mind, spirit, and body.  How Working Out Has Helped Me  In its simplest form, confidence comes down to vanity and with the outward changes in my body has come the simple enjoyment of my increased attractiveness. For the first time in my life, I get noticed in public and I wear shorts and sleeveless shirts without hesitation. Being lean and lithe and firm is often cause for an increase in attention from both sexes; however, being a woman, this can often be negative as it is inevitably said that a thin and fit woman is ""lucky."" The fact that she sweats it out in a gym an hour or more each day and denies herself those extra cookies is of little note. I have born much criticism from family and friends about being ""obsessed"" and needing to ""live a little.""  What is often dismissed as shear vanity in a female is often, in reality, a sense of pride and increased self-worth that comes from enjoying the payoff of that hard work in the gym. Beyond that simple pride comes a deeper confidence that if I can change my body, I can change my life. I am in control. I see much less hesitation in my manner and face most tasks these days with a sureness that I never before possessed. As I learned that lifting a weight at a particular angle developed a specific segment of the muscle, so have I seen that looking at an outside issue from disparate angles can more fully develop the mind. As I have learned to be patient and control both the positive and the negative movements of the weight, so I have learned patience in other aspects of my life. Control causes an increase in development and strength in many areas, not just bodybuilding.  And finally, I have realized the simple physical pleasure of possessing strength. I can lift more, run harder and am more active at 34 than I was 10 years ago. Hundreds of articles and books and web sites are dedicated to listing the various benefits of weight and cardio-vascular training, but it comes down to feeling good and feeling strong, being able to do what you want or need with a minimum of help. Physical strength is its own reward. The independence that accompanies increased physical strength further increases confidence in my own abilities.  So it follows that I am happy with the progress I have made, but I can never see a point when I will be content to stop improving my body, as I hope to never reach the day when I have nothing more I wish to learn. So where do I fit into society?  Bodybuilding is still a rather unconventional sport for women. For every group of guys lifting hard in the gym, there will be a singular female. Generally, women are accepted once we have been noted as being dedicated, but to other women we are still very much on the outside. It becomes tiresome explaining that: no, I am not afraid of getting big, or yes, I really do eat carbs, and finally, NO, you CAN NOT see my stomach! Women have even been so bold as to ask if, at my low body fat, I still have a period. My grandmother illuminated the ""fact"" for me that it just wasn't feminine to push my body so hard and men did not LIKE girls with muscles; women were meant to be soft.  In confronting such gender Stereotypes, I appreciate that my body has natural, genetic limits, and that it is inherently unique, and thus responds to training and dietary changes as such. My mind however is far less limited than my body and my range of perception is inexhaustible if only I choose to open my eyes and my mind ever wider.  As to my Granny's belief that men do not like women with muscles, I will agree to a certain extent, as there are men who indeed are not attracted to ""buff"" women, just as there are men and women who do not prefer redheads or tall girls. But there are another group of men who do not like muscular women more on the basis of what the muscle signifies about that woman. A woman who is in good shape is a woman who has goals and obvious strength; she must be dedicated to strengthening her body, and she will usually be unafraid, if not proud, to show it. Some men do not like the manifestation of physical strength because they feel that it somehow lessens their own masculinity to be seen with such an obviously strong female, but others like less the signs of personal pride and character in a fit woman's appearance, which all but scream that this is indeed a woman who can achieve and will not be held in check if she does not want to be.  Conversely, there are men who are attracted to that lone woman sweating it out in the squat rack, not because of her looks so much as because HERE he sees determination and more than physical strength, HERE is character. This woman has the pride and self-respect to build her body and the courage to persevere in spite of some harsh criticism. A man who recognizes this woman as being someone outside the norm also knows that these character traits will follow this buff chick beyond the walls of the weight room.  Why Bodybuilding Is A Personal Sport  As I proceed in with my own insatiable quest for perfection I find that this is a personal sport and we each gain different insights from it. I have learned to make better use of my other gifts as I have developed the confidence to change my body. I have learned that any changes that I wish to make in my life are up to me to make. When I get up and go to the gym at 4:30 a.m. to improve myself, it is for me that I am going, and it MUST be only for me. This strength that I find inside can only be useful when I develop it to please myself; it is not a gift that I can give another person, nor something I do to please those around me.  While it is nice that my husband likes my stomach and it is great that I am asked how I got arms like these, when it comes down to it, at 4:30 every morning, it is up to me to do what needs to be done in the weight room. And after that... it is up to me and only me to do what needs to be done to keep improving myself for the rest of the day.

5 Factors And Risks Of Amenorrhea In Women!
Reproductive function is a health concern for both male and female athletes. Learn more about the factors and risks of amenorrhea to keep your body balanced and healthy for the rest of your life!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/5-factors-and-risks-of-amenorrhea-in-women.htm,"Article Summary: Amenorrhea is caused by low levels of GnRH and LH hormones.The level of body fat needed in order for normal menstrual function can differ.After removing the interfering factors, the menstrual cycle should begin again.  Reproductive function is a significant health concern for both male and female athletes and, for those who use anabolic steroids, the concern becomes even greater. While men may experience changes in libido and natural testosterone production, the effect training, dieting and anabolic steroid use has on the female body is immediately noticed via changes in the menstrual cycle.  In fact, many female athletes report menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea (the absence of periods for 3-12 months). There are several reasons for this disruption in the normal menstrual cycle, the most frequent cause being a dysfunction at the hypothalamic level - often referred to as functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.  Put simply, the hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which regulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones are released by the pituitary gland and are involved in regulating the release of other key hormones (e.g. estrogen) from the ovaries.   What Is The Hypothalamus? The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis).  When there is an absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), this means that a suppressed level of both GnRH and LH levels has been observed. This suppression can be caused by many factors and is not just related to the use of anabolic steroids. For example:  1. Low Body Fat  Female athletes often have very low body fat levels - this is especially true of women bodybuilders who diet to reduce their body fat levels well below what could be considered 'healthy'.  The level of body fat needed in order for normal menstrual function can differ from individual to individual. There are many textbooks out there who throw out percentage requirements (usually around 8%) for maintenance of the menstrual cycle. However, some women can fall below this and still experience a regular cycle.  On the other hand, some women can experience disrupted cycles when their body fat is over 10%. This is where individual body chemistry comes in to play. Another factor which plays an important part in menstrual function is...  RELATED POLL How Often Do You Diet?   I always diet and exercise. I go on diets every now and then. I never diet.    2. Training Intensity  When women undertake high-volume/high-intensity exercise programs they often exhibit significant changes in gonadotropins, cortisol, and testosterone levels. Add to this a reduction in body fat level and the presence of anabolic substances and it is not hard to see why the menstrual cycle decides to go on vacation.  There is just too much hormonal chaos to deal with! You have also got to bear in mind that the whole menstrual cycle is there to facilitate procreation. In order to support the growth of another life form, the body has to feel that ample sustenance and a healthy environment is present, and intense exercise, low body fat, and an extreme diet could hardly be considered as healthy in this instance. Click To Enlarge.When Women Undertake High-Volume/High-Intensity Exercise Programs  They Often Exhibit Significant Changes In Gonadotropins, Cortisol, And Testosterone Levels. 3. Dietary Restrictions  Low fat, low carbohydrate diets can also result in significant changes in circulating hormone levels. Any form of dietary restriction can create nutritional deficiencies and place stress on the body.  When calorie restriction is severe the production of adequate hormones to allow menstruation to occur is not on top of the body's 'to-do' list. Keeping you alive is! You have to remember that your survival is of ultimate importance and the body will do whatever it needs to conserve energy so that vital functions are maintained. In this case menstruation is not a vital function. Click To Enlarge.Low Fat, Low Carbohydrate Diets Can Also Result In Significant  Changes In Circulating Hormone Levels. 4. Anabolic Steroid Use  The use of anabolic steroids by female athletes is often responsible for a range of menstrual irregularities including the complete cessation of the monthly period.  Certain steroids like Nandrolone, Oxymetholone and Ethylestrenol are known to inhibit ovulation and trigger amenorrhea. However, the amount of these substances used would also play a significant role when it comes to inhibiting menstruation, as would individual body chemistry.  In fact, when it comes to the effect anabolic steroids have on the reproductive system individual body chemistry is key. There have been many reports of women taking small amounts of testosterone and still maintaining a regular menstrual cycle - although such individuals are definitely the exception rather than the rule.  On the other hand, some women can lose their monthly period on small amounts of Anavar due to its interference with the estrogen/progesterone cycles  5. The Health Risks  When there is a prolonged absence of menstruation there can be a substantial change in bone mineral density and an increased risk for osteoporosis. This would be less of a concern for women who use anabolic steroids although it would still be important for those athletes to pay attention to the acid balance in their body and to keep their calcium intake high.   What Is Osteoporosis? Osteoporosis is a disease of bones that leads to an increased risk of fracture. In osteoporosis the bone mineral density (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture is disrupted, and the amount and variety of proteins in bone is altered.  The verdict is still out as regards the long term health risks of amenorrhea and some women even welcome the reprieve from their 'monthly visitor'. In fact some forms of contraceptive pills are designed to reduce the amount of periods a woman has each year so that would lead us to believe that it is not necessary to menstruate every month.  One thing is for sure though, the menstrual cycle is pretty resilient and once all the factors that have been interfering with it are removed it usually returns in a few months at most.  Whether this return is welcome or not depends on how you view its presence in your life. I know some women who feel lost without their period while others consider it totally liberating.

HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation: The Holy Grail Of Optimized Natural Human Performance
The first and most important How-to answer in the optimization of human performance begins with HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation. Learn more...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/core_june_3.htm,"During the 70's and early 80's supplement makers had little to offer in the way of anything useful for athletes, okay, other than vitamins and poor quality protein powders that tasted like sweetened dog food. Well, actually it was mostly animal grade soy protein with sugar added so I guess it was.  In the 90's, a few viable performance-enhancing options such as creatine monohydrate and whey protein made their way into the market thus finally offering health and performance oriented alike something of statistical value.  What Happened?  In today's media-hysteria-managed environment, athletes, supplement companies and drug dealers alike are seen in the same shady light. Why? In the new millennium performance enhancement through supplementation became a science. (No joke, really!)  As the better companies employed more real scientists, they became more apt at researching and marketing substances that truly could be said to be ""steroid-like"" in effect. And of course, the pharmaceutical industry, sports organizations and government agencies took interest. The pharma industry because of money, sports organizations because players wanted more, and the government because of both reasons.  It has to be a sad state of affairs when a society has reached a point in its ineptitude that government intervention is deemed necessary as a means of controlling individual choice for performance enhancement, or not, from over the counter supplementation. Yet the only qualification required for purchase of enough alcohol to kill ones self is 21 years of age and the capacity to say ""Bud"".  After all, no one seems appalled by the unfair advantage performance enhancement drugs like Viagra (sildenafil citrate) and Cialis (tadalafil) allows cheaters. (Don't get me started on the unfair advantages women with large breast augmentations have over post-nursing mothers...Okay, like I care)   Are Viagra & Cialis Unfair Advantages Or Divine Blessings?  Unfair Advantages. Divine Blessings.      We're Not In Kansas Anymore...    As a result of today's media-hysteria-managed environment, everyone wants to write a tell-all book and government intervention, we have moved into an era of supplementation skepticism leaving only a few options left to truly innovative supplement makers. Well, at least those with an interest in the future of our industry and an authentic interest in the edge science can offer athletes (and every day normal people as well):  Work to maximize human performance through health promoting physiological optimization (WADA, IOC and pro-sports friendly)  Bring on greater government intervention and regulation for the entire sports and supplemental industry.  Move to Mexico where no one cares what you do to yourself...and take lots of Viagra or Cialis.  Where To Start  The first and most important How-to answer in the optimization of human performance begins with HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation: The Holy Grail of optimized natural human performance enhancement.  Before I go on, realize that this is the catalyst for all of the good things you really want to happen if performance optimization is your goal...so take the time to read it!  The human body has the ability to naturally produce amazing amounts of anabolic goodies like testosterone, GH (growth hormone), IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1) and insulin. It also has the ability make more thyroid hormones and other fat burning substances than you could ever reasonably want (never met a reasonable bodybuilder but I did hear of one once)  In regard to everyone's favorite naturally occurring man-making androgen, testosterone is king of the muscle building anabolics...and your body can make WAY more than you need through HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation.   Warning: Science Geek Stuff (That Actually Matters)    Both men and women produce testosterone naturally, but here lets primarily focus upon the men. (I will show you a diagram of how the ladies do it as well anyway for the curious)   Endogenous (made inside the body) testosterone production is predominantly a result of, and governed by, the HPTA (Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis). It all begins with a gland located in your head called the hypothalamus when it releases a measured amount of GnRH (also known as LH-releasing hormone).   What Is The Hypothalamus?  An integral part of the limbic system, the hypothalamus is involved in regulation of the internal milieu of the body or, said another way, for homeostatic control.  It does that by means of its neuroendocrine role in conjunction with the pituitary gland as well as by its influence on the the autonomic nervous system, which helps regulate body temperature, the cardiovascular system, and food and water intake.  The small amount of GnRH then makes its way to the pituitary gland to tell it to kick out two other hormones called LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone). Nope, the job is not done yet.  Okay, LH and FSH then take a trip via the vascular system to the testes (testicles, ""The Boy's"", testes... whatever) and make contact with the Leydig cells and Sertoli cells ...which results in testosterone synthesis and sperm production respectively.  HPTA Function Pathways    The amount of GnRH, LH and FSH produced regulates the amount of  testosterone, androstenediol and  DHEA your body produces...or not. If the HPTA produces supraphysiological amounts of GnRH, LH and FSH, it actually also produces more performance enhancing goodies like testosterone, androstenediol and DHEA by way of overcompensation. Getting the idea here?   THAT is HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation. The Question You Really Want To Ask... Why Don't ""My Boy's"" Do That Naturally?  Like all things we really like in life, there is a series of checks and balances that keep things in control and limit the amounts of good stuff we can have (like girlfriends). In the case of HPTA-function and optimized testosterone production, it is due to 2 primary negative feed-back loops. (Most know this first one, but let's recap to be sure).   Estrogen Negative Feed-Back Loop    High estrogen levels are not the sole propriety of women with amazing sweater puppets and bizarre mood swings. Men produce it too, and in most cases, there is way too much in any man's system than nature meant there to be. This also helps to explain way males produce less testosterone and sperm today than they did only 2 generations ago.   This is due significantly to un-natural (exogenous) exposure to the overabundance of plant-derived phytoestrogens (such as those found in soy products) and xenoestrogens in plastics and herbicides today.   What Is Xenoestrogen?  Literally, xenoestrogens are estrogens that are foreign: i.e. not produced in ones own body. (Xeno comes from the Greek, meaning strange or foreign.)  Thus estrogen produced by a cow (which is present throughout the meat) is a xenoestrogen. As such if one eats beef, one is eating a xenoestrogen.  Unless of course it is a bull and then one is eating xenotestosterone.  Don't get me started on chemically raised meats and pesticides either.  Natural (endogenous) estrogen is predominantly made in the male body from the aromatization of endogenous (made inside the body) androgens (such as testosterone) into estrogens. This is the responsibility of an enzyme called aromatase that is present pretty much everywhere in the body...even the brain around the hypothalamus (remember that).  When too much estrogen interacts with the estrogen receptors of the hypothalamus, there is a negative feed-back loop that tells the gland that there must be too much testosterone as well. The result is a dramatic unhealthy reduction, or even shut-down, of the HPTA and girl status for the owner of the saggy-sack problem. But it gets worse...  Click Here For The Top Selling Anti-Estrogen Products.  Androgen Negative Feed-Back Loop    The hypothalamus also has lots of androgen receptors for sensing the level of testosterone and other androgens circulating in the body. When too many androgen receptors of the hypothalamus become activated, there is a decrease or even total shut-down in GnRH release. This means that ""The Boy's"" pretty much have nothing to do because the lack of GnRH release also means no LH or FSH release.   So the end result is your testes have no reason to produce testosterone or sperm...and no reason to optimize muscular activities, recovery or have sex. Hmmm, look bad, feel bad and not care. That is ugly. Anabolic Steroid Users & Saggy-Sacks  The reason most AAS users employ the drugs is to un-naturally increase their testosterone levels to 2-5 times what is so-called natural or normal. Of course the results are obvious: Increased muscle mass, decreased fat mass, a marked increase in metabolic rate, better focus, and improved performance in every manly area. The bad results are all of the negative side-effects from excessive estrogen and lipid issues that synthetic androgens can cause.  Normal total testosterone production for a healthy male is about 500-600ng/dl (too many are in the 200-350ng/dl range due to environmental estrogens alone), but some AAS users push the levels into the 2000-3000ng/dl plus area. As a result of all of this excess testosterone floating aroundthe body, there is a lot of aromatization to estrogens and an overabundance of androgen receptors of the hypothalamus being over-stimulated. The outcome is obviously the loss of testicular function due to both negative feed-back loops occurring.  Many AAS users know that by decreasing the amount of circulatory estrogen, they are also able to somewhat decrease HPTA down-regulation. Post-cycle AAS therapy, in most cases, includes something to decrease estrogen levels and activity, and some other drug to replace LH. If done correctly the end result again is an increase in actual natural testosterone product 1-2 times above normal for a brief period.  Clomiphen, Anastrazole and HCG...Oh My (The Most Common PCT)  PCT stands for Post-Cycle-Therapy and refers to HPTA regeneration or stimulation. Anabolic steroid users and those looking to increase endogenous androgen production alike, have used this so-called stack almost like a religious rite not realizing there was an error in its structure.  Clomiphen Citrate is the generic name for Clomid which is a fertility drug used to stimulate ovulation in women and increase sperm production in men. Clomiphen citrate is actually a very weak estrogen in itself. It works by blocking more powerful and active estrogens from merging with the hypothalamic estrogen receptors. The end result is the hypothalamus ""perceives"" that there is less circulatory estrogen and responds by increasing GnRH release. In addition there is some degree of decrease in estrogen activity throughout the rest of the body as well for the same reason. As a rule 50mg daily for 2-3 weeks of clomiphen citrate has been noted as effective for this purpose.  Anastrolzole is a generic name for the drug Arimidex. This is an aromatase enzyme inhibitor that decreases conversion of susceptible androgens into estrogens. This action results in a decrease in total circulatory estrogen. As little as 1mg 3 times weekly post-cycle for 30 days has been shown to decrease estrogen by 50% and have some benefits in regard to HPTA regeneration due to its mopping up effect.  But this combination only helps clean up the effects of the Estrogen Negative Feed-Back Loop leaving the Androgen Negative Feed-Back Loop unaffected.  HCG refers to Human Chorionic Gonadotropin. This is a hormone that is produced by pregnant women and used in fertility medicine. In males, HCG has been shown to mimic LH thus administration results in direct stimulation of the testes resulting in minimal increases in sperm production and significant increases in testicular testosterone production.   Human Chorionic Gonadotropin  Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, or hCG, production begins approximately 8-10 days after conception when the embryo starts to burrow itself into the lining of the uterus.  It is this hormone that is measured by early pregnancy tests and if present, will return a positive result.  An hCG beta blood test is much more sensitive than an HPT, and can detect pregnancy as early as 10 days after fertilization.  Interestingly enough, this pregnant woman's hormone is effective to a point that some studies have shown it to be able to prevent testicular dysfunction during anabolic steroid use. But again, that is a whole other article. Most have realized notable HPTA recovery and/or androgen production stimulation form administering 1000iu HCG 3 times weekly for 21 days post-cycle.  Hmmm, still nothing to ""positively"" affect the Androgen Negative Feed-Back Loop.  Action/Reaction... And Things That Go Hump More In the Night  The ideal situation would be the ability to decrease estrogen levels in the whole body while decreasing androgen activity of the hypothalamus specifically. Of course we would not want to decrease androgen receptor activity in other peripheral areas like muscle tissue, and we would want focused estrogen control around the hypothalamus to create the best performance enhancing synergy naturally. Can that be done? Of course it can, just as Nolvadex is way more specific to breast tissue, some really cool compounds are WAY more specific to the hypothalamus.  The result would be long term HPTA Supraphysiological Overcompensation and viable naturally occurring testosterone production at a significant and highly effective level. This would (and has) obviously allow for optimization of human male performance. That is a perfect example of correct application of the body's natural health promoting Action/Reaction Factors.  If you have read this far, then you already realize that I have explained the physiological and environmental factors that foster an un-natural chain of events resulting in significant reduction and limitation for every male's performance...in every aspect of the word.  If you are interested in legal and natural ways to optimize male physical and mental performance (and improve the fun of what goes Hump in the night) then read on.  We Had To Start Somewhere...   Chrysin    Sometime in the early 80's Dan Duchaine proposed that a plant aromatase called Chrysin (Flavone X) was comparable in effect to the well-known biosynthesis inhibitor/anti-aromatase Cytadren (Aminoglutethimide).    Dan Duchaine, 1952-2000 Known as the Steroid Guru, Dan Duchaine was the author of The Underground Steroid Handbook. He died from complications related to polycystic kidney disease on January 12, 2000.  Fellow writer and friend Will Brink set up The Dan Duchaine Memorial Fund in his memory. Contributions can be made by sending donations to: The Dan Duchaine Memorial Fund, c/o CEO Steve Evangelista, National Kidney Foundation, 129 Morgan Drive, Norwood MA02062.  This was due to the structural similarities the two compounds possessed. Dan was sharp (he kept us all thinking), but he missed on this one. In truth Chrysin totally bombed out in the real-world as it is actually just another phytoestrogen making male users fat and less masculine.  AT    Until recently the only well known and statistically effective OTC supplemental anti-aromatase for systemic (whole body) estrogen control was delta-4-10, 13-dimethyl-cyclopenta[a]phenantrene-3,6,17-trione (A.K.A. 4-androstene- 3,6,17-trione) or ""AT"" for short. (One trade name for it was Aromax by Applied Lifescience Research Industries Inc.).   One main concern with the ""AT"" structure is its potential conversion to the feminizing estrogens 6-keto-estrone and 6-keto-estradiol (Estradiol's of any kind are as much as 10 times more powerful than estrogen's).  Naturally there is a dose dependant issue here which is a supplemental oxymoron: Low bioavailability means higher dosages needed, that in turn result in greater amounts of AT being converted to the feminizing estrogens 6-keto-estrone and 6-keto-estradiol. Read on, you will understand better...  Depending upon bodyweight and level of estrogens in a man's body, at 600mg daily AT appears to be reasonably useful, and in truth it was the only viable option for sometime.  The main limitation for this compound is that it has poor oral bioavailability (the reason for required dosages being above the half gram mark daily), and of course it only aids inhibition of the Estrogen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop.  This is not to say that it was not a useful compound. However, the Androgen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop still remains the main limiting factor.  Synergy Key To An Optimization Matrix  There are some very effectual options currently coming to market that have viable research behind them that specifically address both the estrogen-negative-feed-back-loop and the androgen-negative-feed-back-loop on multiple levels.   3-O-WHO?    6,17-dioxo-etiocholene-3-ol (A.K.A. 3-OHAT) is a natural occurring metabolite of the popular anti-aromatase supplement 4-androstene- 3,6,17-trione (AT) mentioned prior. It possesses a much longer half-life (stays active in the body longer) thus allowing for improved efficiency from a single daily dosage. Additionally it is noted as a non-androgenic aromatase inhibitor. This means that 3-OHAT is an excellent fast-acting long-term destroyer of the testosterone limiting Estrogen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop...and does not stimulate androgen receptors of the hypothalamus and the Androgen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop. Studies have shown that even acting alone, 3-OHAT increases HPTA activity resulting in more testosterone production via natural pathways in humans and animals.   ATD & Focus    3,17-dioxo-etiochol-1,4,6-triene (A.K.A. ATD) has a prolonged affinity for the estrogen mediating aromatase enzyme. In fact, it is actually about 2.8 times more powerful than AT for this reason. So great, it is more powerful than AT and even more powerful than 3-OHAT in a different way. Big deal?   In vitro studies have shown ATD to be a powerful androgen receptor blocker of the hypothalamus...but not of peripheral androgen receptors. What's this mean in English? It means that ATD blocks the Androgen-Negative-Feed-Back-Loop and aids in decreasing estrogen production while increasing natural testosterone production. (If you are paying attention and focusing a little here, I am sure the real point of this article just hit you)  Synergy    There is a need for synergy in anything in life and physiological Action/Reaction Factors are no exception. As you know by stopping Both negative feed back loops, the hypothalamus will produce more GnRH which in turn means that the pituitary will produce more LH/FSH and ""The Boy's"" will kick out a whole lot of male optimizing testosterone. Sounds good in theory?   Of course some studies have shown that the correct ratio of 3-OHAT and ATD administered to adult human males results in an average increase in bioavailable testosterone of up to 400% and a direct decrease in estrogens of an average 50%. (No joke!) Up to 4 times the man and half the girl is not a bad natural improvement for a lad.  Okay, But What About The Real World...  I personally do not believe anything I cannot prove myself in the lab. As such we used 8 healthy males as human guinea pigs to test what the research claims to be factual.  4 acted as a placebo base-line group receiving 6 capsules daily of cornstarch, and the other 4 got the real deal consisting of a proprietary 50mg blend of both 3-OHAT and ATD.  During the pre-administration period we tested for Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone and Estradiol, then tested again at 14 and 42 days.  Results:   Placebo Group     No significant changes (Gee, are you surprised?) in total or free testosterone and estradiol.   Subject 1 (24 year old male)    Pre-testing:         Total Testosterone: 350ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 83.00pg/ml        Estradiol: 39pg/ml        14 Days         Total Testosterone: 1803ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 522.20pg/ml        Estradiol: 27pg/ml        42 Days         Total Testosterone: 2895ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 839.20pg/ml        Estradiol: <20       Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone & EstradiolClick To Enlarge.

Subject 3 (25 year old male)    Pre-testing:         Total Testosterone: 555ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 104.00pg/ml        Estradiol: <20        14 Days         Total Testosterone: 1624ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 405.7pg/ml        Estradiol: <20        42 Days         Total Testosterone: 1837ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 547.40pg/ml        Estradiol: <20       Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone & EstradiolClick To Enlarge.  Subject 4 (51 year old male)    Pre-testing:         Total Testosterone: 584ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 13.40ng/dl        Estradiol: 47pg/ml        14 Days         Total Testosterone: 851ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 26.10ng/dl        Estradiol: <20        42 Days         Total Testosterone: 875ng/dl        Free Testosterone: 30.30ng/dl        Estradiol: <20       Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone & EstradiolClick To Enlarge.  Interpreting The Data    Test results showed a net increase in total and free testosterone ranging from 50-800% with a significant reduction in estradiol of about 50%. More importantly is that the elevation was maintained for a long enough period to allow notable benefits from a physiological stand-point (weeks, not just a few minutes). Huh, go figure, the studies are right.   Conclusion  Testosterone is the anabolic steroid that all other AAS (Anabolic-Androgenic-Steroid) are compared to...and your body can naturally and legally produce far more than you actually need. Most negative side effects come from the use of AAS, not from the excess of natural endogenous testosterone itself.  Click Here For The Top Selling Natural Testosterone Products. I would like to see the results from the same test subjects using the 50mg 3-OHAT/ATD proprietary blend with the addition of Agaricus bisporus extract (white button mushroom from a specific region) and 7b-hydroxy-DHEA. The Agaricus bisporus extract because the right method of extract provides some very effective site-specific aromatase enzyme inhibition, and the 7b-Hydroxy-DHEA because it is preferential physiological base compound for many good things.

Soy Facts & Recipes: Vegetarian-Friendly Protein In A Positive Light!
Soy protein is not only the fountain of youth; it's a great insurance policy against a number of illnesses... Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/soy_protein_facts.htm,"We all have women in our lives we love. In the US one in four women die of heart disease. Soy protein is not only the fountain of youth; it's a great insurance policy against a number of illnesses, including heart disease. In addition, soy can alleviate countless menopausal symptoms and is a healthier alternative to animal proteins. Heart Health  Of the 500,000 annual deaths from cardiovascular disease, 267,000 women die from heart attacks - six times as many women as will die from breast cancer.1 Ingesting 25 grams of soy protein every day, may reduce your risk of heart disease. ISFLAVONES Isaflavones comprise a class of organic compounds, often naturally occurring, related to the flanonoids. Many act as phytoestrogensin mammals. Being polyphenols, they are antioxidants. Some isoflavones and osoflavone-rich foods possess activity against cancer, incuding certain types of breast and prostate cancer.  Isoflavones found in soy are the antioxidant compounds responsible for this positive effect. Research has found that these powerful antioxidants may improve the health of the lining of blood vessels, which in turn can reduce the risk for heart disease. 2, 3 In addition, they may also inhibit certain negative effects of LDL-cholesterol, known as ""bad"" cholesterol, making the LDL-cholesterol less damaging to arteries. 4, 5Soy and Diabetes  Heart disease is one of diabetes' major complications. Those with the disease need to pay extra attention to the positive effects acquired from ingesting soy protein. This is because soy protein foods can help to maintain optimal glucose and insulin levels which is critical for Diabetics. 10Soy's Cancer Fighting Effects Genistein and PhytoestrogensGenistein is one of several known isoflavones. Isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are found in a number of plants, soybeans, and soy products like tofu. Textured vegetable protein is the primary food source. Phtoestrogens, sometimes called ""Dietary estrogens,"" are a diverse group of naturally occurring non steroidal plant compounds that, because of their structual similarity with estradiol, have the abilty to cause estrenic or/and antiestrogenic effects.  Soy contains cancer-fighting phytos. The phytonutrient most prominent in soy protein products is genistein, which has been shown to have anti-cancer properties. 14 Soy protein also contains phytoestrogen, which has been shown to reduce the risk and spread of prostate cancer. 14Soy and Menopause  These wonderful isoflavones found in soy protein, have also recently been found to inhibit post-menopausal bone loss. Several studies have been done comparing bone density in American women and Chinese women who intake a considerably greater amount of soy. The studies showed that the Chinese women were one-third less likely to break a bone. 6 What is even more interesting is that one study showed that the effects of isoflavones seem similar to standard hormone therapy, which is known to decrease risk for fractures. 7  These effects are a great option for those who are concerned with the negative side effects that hormone replacement therapy may cause. These side effects include nausea, bloating, increased risk of heart attack, stroke, negative effects on mood to mention just a few.  Aside from the fact that healthy protein levels make for healthy looking hair, soy isoflavones have been found to alleviate women's problem with hair thinning during menopause. Hair loss during menopause can occur as a result of falling progesterone levels caused by ovulation cessation.  Soy isoflavones provide estrogenic effects without the risks involved in using synthetic hormone replacement therapy and thus improve thinning hair. 8  Isoflavones found in soy can also help relieve hot flashes. Scientists have observed that women in Asian countries, where soy is a regular part of the diet, are less likely to report hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms than are women in other parts of the world. 9 Soy Protein Is Just Better!  Soybeans are considered by many agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration, to be a source of complete protein. 11 A complete protein is one that contains significant amounts of all the essential amino acids that must be provided to the human body because of the body's inability to synthesize them. 12 For this reason, soy is considered to be a great source of protein for vegetarians and vegans.  Yet soy is not just for vegetarians, it is a good replacement for animal based protein since animal based proteins tend to contain more fat, especially saturated fat. Aside from that, soy is easier on your tummy! Between 30 and 50 million Americans [are] lactose intolerant. 13  Symptoms of lactose intolerance following consumption of dairy foods include, gut pain and distension, flatus and diarrhea. 13 Though yogurt is known to contain bacteria, which improves intestinal health, it can still be very hard on the stomach. Soy contains nutritionally valuable carbohydrates called ""fructooligosaccharides"" (FOS), which nourish the helpful intestinal bacteria without the irritation caused by lactose. 14 For these reasons soy is an ideal alternative to dairy.  For so many reasons soy is a great addition to every woman's diet. Soy can increase heart health, lower cancer risk, increase bone health, and alleviate countless menopausal symptoms. Soy protein contains less fat, no cholesterol and ten times as much fiber as animal protein. It is also much easier on your stomach making it a fantastic alternative to animal proteins and dairy products. All in all it seems soy is pure joy.

Body Fat: A Necessary Evil? What Is It And What Is Its Purpose?
Not sure why you are fat. Get some great facts right here! In this article I will discuss body fats composition and why it is needed, how it distributes itself, why some possess excessive levels and what can be done about it.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson235.htm,"One major enemy of the Western world does not come in human form. Rather, it is a substance, an energy component, that many spend their lives trying to rid themselves of. At once considered a health concern and a necessary health component, this substance, fat, which comes in various forms and compositions, is on the minds of many as they begin their day.  Much of big businesses commercial success hinges on fat removal for health and aesthetic reasons. New and innovative diets and training regimens designed for the express purpose of reducing its deposition are springing up almost daily, such is its reputation as a health concern and the implications it has for all who posses excessive levels.  With such an emphasis on fat reduction between much of the world's industrialized population and with all the coverage it receives in various media, there seems to be a surprising lack of insight as to exactly what it is and why we at turns need a certain amount, but not an oversupply.  While many know what body fat is in its more obvious problematic form, few have a detailed understanding of what its purpose really is. So why do we have body fat and exactly what is this, often-unsightly substance that, if maintained at an appropriate level, can be crucial for survival, health and wellbeing?  In this article I will discuss body fats composition and why it is needed, how it distributes itself, why some possess excessive levels and what can be done about it.  Body Fat What Is Body Fat, What Are Its Problems & Why Do We Need It?   What Is Body Fat?  Stored body fat in its most easily recognisable lumpy form - the type that contributes to obesity if accumulated in significant quantities - is made up of free fatty acids liberated from various lipoproteins (a lipoprotein is a chemical compound made of protein and fat, that transports lipids around the body to perform various biological functions).   RELATED ARTICLE  Body Fat - What Is It?   Fat is a tissue that is needed by the body for a wide variety of functions such as temperature regulation, shock absorption, etc. Learn here what body fat is, how much we actually have, and much more. [ Click here to learn more. ]  Once liberated, these fats if not used as energy, will be stored in adipocytes (commonly referred to as fat cells), which form the composition of adipose tissue. From there they are assembled into triglycerides to be stored for future use. When we refer to body fat we are talking about adipose tissue and its lipid containing adipocytes.  Adipose tissue is primarily situated beneath the skin, where its main role is to store energy in the form of fat. Depending on its quantity and deposition, this stored fat can be good or bad.   What Are Its Problems? On the downside, fat cells have been shown to play a role in determining insulin resistance. A large accumulation of abdominal fat (or central obesity) is viewed as an important marker of diabetes as, due to its specific metabolic profile, and given it can prevent a normal insulin response, it is more prone to impaired glucose tolerance, a state that often leads to full-blown diabetes.  Diagnosed by measuring the hip to waist ratio, central obesity (which can be confirmed if the waist measurement exceeds 1.0 in men, or 0.9 in women) also contributes to the expression of Resistin, a hormone that is thought to suppress the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in fat cells, thus potentially linking obesity to diabetes.  In addition to its influence on insulin response, central obesity is also considered a major risk factor for high blood pressure and heart disease, making it something to be avoided at all costs.   RELATED ARTICLE  Give Yourself A Healthy Heart.   We all know that exercise is crucial for the heart. But let's not forget about some of the nutrients that we must include for optimum health. [ Click here to learn more. ]  In fact, topping the list of combined factors which may result in ""metabolic syndrome"", or an increased risk for both heart disease and diabetes (type 2), is waist circumference - for men a measurement of 40 inches or more, or for women 35 inches, will significantly increase their chances of getting metabolic syndrome.  Aromatase Production:  An additional concern for those who possess excessive fat is its potential to produce the enzyme aromatase. Adipose tissue is the greatest peripheral source of the aromatase in both males and females and it has been shown, in some cases, to advance breast cancer, although its principal function is to transform androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol, thus increasing estrogen levels.  Excessive estrogen can contribute to several health problems, including the aforementioned breast cancer (as in women who are estrogen-dominant it may cause rapid growth of cancer cells), risk of heart disease and stroke, baldness, obesity (which can cause a vicious weight-loss cycle) and reduced sexual appetite, not to mention the diminishing of testosterone, which has many beneficial functions such as fat reduction and muscle and bone growth.   View Anti-Estrogen Products Sorted By Top Sellers Here.   Why Do We Need It?  While it is obvious that surplus fat can contribute to a raft of health problems, several of which are mentioned above, at acceptable limits it can be advantageous. An acceptable level of fat (defined as between 18 and 24 percent for men and 25 to 31 percent for women, according to the American Council on Exercise) can promote favourable health conditions.  Hormone Production:  According to Zhaoping Li, M.D., director of clinical research at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, ""Fat cells are not as passive as physicians once thought. It has been widely accepted that fat tissue doesn't merely store fat but, rather, is an endocrine organ that secretes hormones to regulate appetite, insulin sensitivity and body weight1.""  Hormones leptin, which acts on the hypothalamus to suppress appetite and burn fat stored in adipose tissue, TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor), which controls the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and helps cells heal or repair, and the prostaglandins (hormone-like substances), which regulate many of the body's functions, are examples of the beneficial molecules liberated from fat.  One who has an acceptable level of body fat will produce sufficient quantities of these hormones, whereas obese people, as mentioned, produce hormones that encourage the accumulation of body fat.  Triglyceride & Free Fatty Acid Levels:  Fat cells also play an important role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, the former being the chemical form in which most fats exist, the latter the components of triglycerides (fatty acids and glycerol) that are released into the blood to provide energy (these fats can yield relatively large quantities of ATP, the body's energy molecule).   RELATED ARTICLE ATP: Energy's Currency!   If one has ever wondered just how we are able to summons the energy to perform a number of activities under a variety of conditions, the answer, in large part, is ATP. Without ATP, ones body would simply fail to function. Learn why...  [ Click here to learn more. ]  Therefore, one who has a ready supply of triglycerides, not an excessive amount, will have an additional energy reserve. Fat as energy is often viewed as being one of the more efficient sources. As fat initially contains very little oxygen - it can combine with more oxygen to produce a longer lasting fuel source.  Additionally, and belying its ability to provide long-term energy, it is stored in the average person in comparatively smaller quantities. To illustrate its energy-giving benefits, an example of how it is stored can be used: given one-gram of glycogen - the body's primary fuel source - is stored with three grams of water, if it were to be stored in place of fat, which contains nine calories per gram in comparison to carbohydrates four grams, as fuel, a typical 155-pound male would have to weigh an additional 120 pounds.  Insulation:  As well as providing energy and promoting the release of important hormones, fat cells also have an ability to cushion and insulate the body, while fat ensures the absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K. Controlled levels of fat in the diet will help to the maintain levels necessary to effectively provide a thermal layer that will protect the body against cold conditions.  Fat in this capacity serves as a temperature control mechanism to insulate. It is also important to overall wellbeing in its role as a protector of vital organs. Regardless of how low we reduce our body fat, we all should maintain at least three percent, a percentage that will help to cushion vital organs, in particular the kidneys, heart and intestines.  This will help to hold these organs in place and protect them from injury. To illustrate the importance of this protective mechanism, the body will actually draw from these body fat stores last when its energy reserves are being tapped into.  Vitamin Absorption:  Fat is also needed to absorb certain vitamins that are crucial for health and wellbeing. A, D, E, and K, the fat-soluble vitamins, are so named as they are absorbed by, and stored in the fat cells to be used when needed. In fact this is one of the main benefits to having adequate fat in our diets. The recommended daily intake for fat is low (10-15 grams) so most people will achieve the desired amount through their diet.  Obesity Who Is Likely To Become Obese & Why?  Generally speaking and as discussed, body fat per se is not the problem; instead, its volume and distribution is what often leads to its reputation as a health concern. While some are genetically more susceptible to storing higher amounts of body fat, others seem to stay slim regardless of how many calories they shovel in.  The former group often have to fight hard to lose appreciable levels, the latter have no problem with regards to fat related conditions - rather they may actually need to increase its intake to obtain necessary levels. Those with unfavourable genetics usually gain fat more readily because one or both or their parents are overweight.   RELATED ARTICLE  Obesity: The Worldwide Epidemic.   We can no longer single out Americans when identifying obesity. This article will talk about worldwide obesity, eating patterns, and youth obesity including what we can do. [ Click here to learn more. ]   Cultural Context:  In some cases, this obesity problem stems from a survival mechanism needed to sustain certain populations in their original cultural context. For example, the peoples of various Pacific Islands, due, in part, to the cold temperatures experienced travelling by canoe from island to island, developed, as an evolutionary survival mechanism, an additional fatty layer.  Obesity generally did not pose a problem for them. Today, descendants of these people do not brave the same conditions but still have the genetic predilection for fat storage. This inclination combined with modern technology, which often reduces energy output, while increasing overeating due to the abundance of foods available, often results in obesity in people with unfavourable genetics.  If only these people, on a wider scale, knew of this genetic limitation, they could change their eating habits and counter their inbuilt propensity for fat gain. Indeed, changing dietary habits is often touted as a key to controlling weight gain for any population. Compared to some island cultures and their genetic fat storage potential, however, other populations may become obese through different means.   Learned Behaviour:  The impact imparted behaviours can have on future weight gain cannot be understated. Often obese parents will feed their children the kinds of food they themselves ate growing up. Thus, these children, already having the genetics for rapid fat gain, will build more fat cells from an early age, which will contribute to obesity in later life (world reports suggest childhood obesity is on the rise globally).   RELATED ARTICLE  10 Tips For Parents Of Overweight Children!   Parents, it is up to us to make sure our kids are eating right and getting the proper nutrition they deserve. Ive put together 10 solid tips to help you do just that! Remember they learn by watching you. [ Click here to learn more. ]   Fat Cell Growth:  The reason some people gain body fat, whereas others do not is not always genetic in origin though. Like muscle cells, fat cells can also be increased, especially at a young age. Eating fatty foods will, over time, encourage the development of new fat cells. These cells will attract the aforementioned free fatty acids, which will swell them to a greater size, ultimately manifesting itself in obesity.  Although fat can always be lost from these cells, the cells themselves will always be there ready to grow larger with further excessive dietary fat intake.   Gender:  Women and men also experience body fat distribution in different ways. Women, who are genetically programmed to carry more weight for maternal reasons (hence their higher recommended percentage range), tend to accumulate it around their hips and buttocks, whereas men, who are typically leaner and more muscular, generally store it around the waist (the average man has 26 billion fat cells whereas the average women has 35 million).  While both sexes can become obese with excessive calorie consumption, women will, in general, find it harder to lose stubborn body fat. One basis for this, in addition to maternal reasons - maternal fat is essential for reproduction and maintained on the female body to prepare for pregnancy - is its necessary role in ovulation and the higher levels of testosterone men have: it is known that girls don't begin to menstruate until their bodies are composed of at least 17 percent body fat, and men, with their higher testosterone levels will burn greater levels of body fat, both during exercise and at rest due to this hormones ability to use fat for fuel.   RELATED ARTICLE  The Truth About Body Fat In Women!   In comparison to men, it is true women naturally are prone to carrying more fat. Get the facts here about what fat is, who has more, hormonal effects, and more. [ Click here to learn more. ]  So although, as we have seen, there are genetic, cultural, and social reasons for body fat storage, most of us will become obese, or on a lesser scale overweight, if we live our lives in such as way to promote fat storage.  How Does Body Fat Reduction Work?  Body fat reduction can be approached in several ways. One of the keys ways to ensure life-long low body fat levels is to prevent fat cells from growing excessively in the first instance. For most, this means maintaining a diet low in the wrong types of fat (saturated and trans fats) right from the outset. However in all practicality most of us will achieve a good supply of fat cells by adulthood, making the reduction of excessive fat storage all the more important.  The keys to reducing body fat are quite simple but the science behind them is complex. Two major ways to counter fat storage are aerobic training, which uses oxygen and fat as a main fuel source, and resistance training, which builds the necessary muscle needed to stimulate the metabolic rate to burn fat to faster degree.   RELATED ARTICLE  Fat Metabolism!   Dietary fat is not an enemy. In fact, when adequate amounts of good fats (unsaturated) are consumed, it can improve one's health and athletic performance.  [ Click here to learn more. ]   Aerobic Training:  During aerobic activity, where the body works continuously for an extended period at a lower intensity level, the body will effective liberate fat stores (technically free fatty acids) for energy. Given our bodies carry a comparative abundance of fat, as the most efficient energy source available, it will continue to draw from these stores provided one does not cross the anaerobic threshold. At this point carbohydrates will become the preferred source and direct fat burning will cease.   RELATED ARTICLE  Carbohydrate Metabolism!   Like all things, there is much debate about the amount of carbohydrates one needs. One's carbohydrate intake should be decided after taking many other factors into consideration...  [ Click here to learn more. ]   Resistance Training:  With resistance training the nature of the activity is anaerobic in nature, therefore it will not directly use fat as fuel. Rather it will opt for carbohydrate in the form of stored muscle glycogen. However, as an indirect fat burning tool, resistance training is unparalleled.  Given muscle is a metabolically active tissue - meaning it takes much energy to keep it functioning - it needs a significant amount of fuel in the form of fat to maintain it. Thus, the more muscle one has the greater their fat burning furnace will be and the more body fat they will lose.  Conclusion  Body fat is something that we all have to a greater or lesser extent and it's value as a health component is undeniable. However, excessive amounts have been shown to be problematic, fuelling the desire of many to rid their bodies of it.  From a bodybuilding point of view fat is the enemy as it obscures hard-won muscle, from a health standpoint it can cause a raft of problems including heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Conversely, and as this article has shown, fat serves a valid purpose, as part of the intricate design that comprises our physiology, to keep us functioning properly.  Understanding this vital nutrient and how it works to keep us healthy could be seen as a major step forward in health maintenance and disease prevention.  References:  UCLA Healthcare. (2004).

Q & A With Clayton South - May 2005!
Clearing up the confusion for bodybuilders. Below you will find answers to questions about training, supplementation, love handles, water retention, and wanting to get huge with a heart condition.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/south108.htm,"[ Q ] I'm in the Marines, and I've been working out for a year. I've tried countless supplements including NO2, creatine monohydrate, and Optimum's Pro Complex Protein. I am still taking the protein along with my daily vitamin right now, but I'm looking for something to help me bulk up and to get rid of the 'soft' look. I'm looking to not only bulk up, but also cut some fat while I'm at it.  I work out 6 days a week. In addition to suggestions on my supplements, if you could give me a few pointers on how to refine my workouts I would appreciate it.  Thanks!   A. The soft look that you want to eliminate can result from three things: subcutaneous water retention, body fat accumulation, or the failure to sufficiently stimulate fast-twitch muscle fibers.   1. Subcutaneous Water Retention     Excessive water retention can result from excessive carbohydrate consumption, high body fat stores, or insufficient water intake.   Insulin levels surge when you consume too many simple carbohydrates.    When this happens, growth hormone levels drop, testosterone levels drop, and the testosterone to estrogen ratio is tilted in favor of estrogen.  Water retention is symptomatic of high estrogen levels. When women menstruate they often complain of feeling ""bloated"", and this is because estrogen is elevated during ovulation, and water retention results.  Estrogen also encourages the accumulation of body fat.  Click Here For The Top Selling Estrogen Blockers. Testosterone is the dominant male hormone, and testosterone is one of the reasons why men have more muscle and less adipose tissue than women.  If you don't drink enough water, your body will hold on to whatever you do drink. What's more, you will impair your liver and kidney function, and this will have long-term consequences. This kind of damage can not be reversed.  2. Body Fat Accumulation     It is possible to cut fat and build muscle at the same time, but this occurs slowly.    Ask yourself: have you gained ten pounds in the past year? You probably answered yes. Now, how much of that gain was fat-free mass? Six pounds? You've done very well if you've gained six pounds of fat-free mass in the past year.  If you figure out how much of that six pounds of lean muscle mass gain is gained per day, the answer is: 0.0164 of one pound. We are talking about fractions of an ounce per day here. So, you can see how pointless it is to weigh yourself every day on the scale - any daily bodyweight fluctuations will result from water shifting.  This point underscores the fact that muscle gain is an extremely slow process - even assuming that you are eating and training correctly. To gain muscle you must eat clean, unprocessed foods, and train with intensity. You must also provide your body with plenty of rest and sleep.  The process is identical when losing body fat. It takes hard, intelligent, work to become lean. When I interviewed 2000 Ms. Olympia Valentina Chepiga and asked her how long it took for her to get really lean, do you know what she said?  From the beginning, when she started bodybuilding, it took her a total of THREE YEARS to get lean and hard. Body fat reduction, like muscle building, is a slow process.  Valentina Showing Off Her Arms During A Bodybuilding.com Photo Shoot. 3. Training...     As for your training, I think that you are training too much. When you get up at 5am and do your PT, and then workout six days a week, how can your body recover?    When I was in the ARMY I was in a similar situation. I had to cut back my schedule to three days per week, and focus on compound movements like deadlifts, flat bench press and squats. I did 10 minutes of cardio before and after each workout session to circulate blood throughout my body and warm-up my joints. I also kept each workout to a strict limit of 45 minutes.  Click To Enlarge.    Because I was doing my PT at 5 am every day, I didn't want to be lifting six days a week in addition to running 5 miles every morning before breakfast. What's more, I didn't want to be lifting six days a week when I was out in the mountains or the field late at night on exercise.    It's important to understand that you're not just training your muscles when you exercise - you're also training your central nervous system. And, CNS fatigue is the greatest threat to your health. If your central nervous system becomes impaired, you begin to get sick, and even your mental ability to perform seemingly simple tasks becomes severely limited.  Make sure that you are supplementing with a multivitamin, an immune system booster, and IsoFlex. Also, make sure that you exercise and recover correctly.  Also, cut back your training to three days per week, and focus on heavy lifts.  Make your schedule realistic. Working out is not like ammunition; more is NOT always better. Remember this, and find the balance that works for you. Other Factors...   Supplementation:     Supplementation is critical for getting results. So, I recommend taking a multivitamin that has high concentrations of antioxidants. Antioxidants support your immune system and speed recovery. If necessary, supplement also with immune boosting supplements like Echinacea and Siberian ginseng.     You make or break your results, and your muscle is made or lost immediately after lifting. So, supplement with a low-carb, fast acting whey protein isolate supplement post-workout. One quality product that has given my personal training clients good gains is IsoFlex, by Allmax Nutrition.  IsoFlex is a pure product that's made according to pharmaceutical standards - the highest known - and it contains 97% WPI. The quality whey protein isolate in isoflex is critical for your results, because it's important to take a clean and pure WPI product post-workout when your body needs fast acting protein that is quickly released AND quickly absorbed.  While cheaper WPC - whey protein concentrate - products are released quickly, the large size of the molecules will slow their absorption, thereby costing you results. To gain muscle, you need WPI at this critical time, and IsoFlex supplies this protein when it counts.  IsoFlex also has an N02 delivery system. N02 is important because it helps give your muscles more of the nutrients and vitamins they need to recover and grow. More nutrients mean more muscle, greater strength, less soreness and faster recovery. Over time, faster recovery can make a big difference in how big you get.  [ Q ] I'm confused about what supplements to take. Everyone that I ask at my gym gives me different answers and I don't want to waste my money on supplements that I don't need. Please tell me: what supplements do I NEED to take?   A. After nutrition, supplementation is the biggest area of confusion for bodybuilders. So, in order of importance, here are the supplements that you need to take as a bodybuilder.    Immune-System boosters  Multivitamin and mineral formulation  Glutamine (bonded or free)  Protein powder supplement  Immune-System Boosters     Immune-system boosters are necessary for athletes in all sports. Exercise is intense and stresses the body and the immune-system. You can take massive amounts of protein but it won't matter if you are too sick to train.     Immune-system boosting supplements include antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, but also include glutathione precursors, Echinacea, garlic and zinc. Green tea is rich in antioxidants, and also contains tannic acid and polyphenols. For this reason I drink three cups of green tea throughout the day. One immune-system boosting supplement that I use religiously is Immuno-Shield by Irwin Naturals; it's simply stellar.  View All Immune-System Boosters...  Glutamine     Glutamine is important because it helps maintain the free-amino acid pool and positive nitrogen balance. Nitrogen balance helps preserve muscle mass during and after workouts when your muscles need glucose for glycogen manufacture. Glutamine can be used for this, and a glutamine deficiency can initiate muscle wasting.      Nitrogen Balance: The Key To Muscle Growth.   Any bodybuilder would know the key to gaining muscle is protein consumption. But how do we know if we are getting enough protein? You can find out here along with information on proteins and amino acids. [ Click here to learn more. ]  Muscle tissue loss can result in immune system weakness and a loss of muscular functionality. These losses can result in injury which can further impede physical functioning.  Glutamine helps to prevent muscle loss, and whey protein helps to increase muscle mass, thereby offering increased protection to bone. Increased muscle mass and improved body composition will serve to increase metabolic efficiency, and this will further allow for improvements in immune function.  These supplement types form the basis of a solid supplementation program that will yield results. Anything above and beyond these supplements is optional and should be used only when you have first successfully incorporated these supplements into your bodybuilding lifestyle.  View All Top Selling Glutamine Products...  [ Q ] What exactly is 6-OXO? And, what is it used for?    A. 6-OXO, made by  ErgoPharm, (4-Androsten-3,6,17-trione) is classified as a steroid, even though it doesn't exert any direct effect on hormone profile.  Instead, 6-OXO, as an estrogen suicide inhibitor, binds permanently to the estrogen enzyme (because of its high affinity) and renders it inactive.  The inactive enzyme is then removed from the body. The result is lower estrogen levels and an increase in the levels of available testosterone.  Estrogen and testosterone are opposing hormones, and building muscle is possible only when you have high levels of free testosterone.  Muscle building aside, you also need high testosterone levels for immune system health and disease prevention. Low levels of testosterone can lead to sickness, lethargy, depression and a host of other problems, including muscle loss. Simply, testosterone is critical for quality of life, and 6-OXO can help to restore quality of life if your testosterone levels are in decline.  Click Here For The Top Selling Testosterone Boosters. 6-OXO is also effective for when you're trying to lose fat, or when you're trying to boost natural testosterone levels after a cycle of anabolic steroids. Testosterone is anabolic and lipolytic, and increases in your testosterone levels will cause you to lose fat and become more lean and muscular.  6-OXO is suitable for use by young and old people alike, but is not recommended for use by women.  [ Q ] I am an avid reader of your articles on Bodybuilding.com and elsewhere. I have a question about contest preparation. I am six weeks out from a contest and I still have these ridiculous love-handles; I've seen guys six weeks out who look ripped.  I weigh 130lbs at 10% BF - I want to reach 5%. I train with weights three times per week, and I do high-intensity cardio first thing in the morning four days per week. I consume about 1000 calories daily. I eat the same foods everyday (whey, eggs, chicken breast), and I cycle my macronutrients. I drink about 1-2 gallons of water per day.  Do you think I may suffer from water bloat?   A. It is possible that you will suffer from water retention.   The first thing I notice is how low your caloric intake is at six weeks out from the show. An energy intake this low (1000 calories daily) is usually reserved for the last five days prior to a competition.  Why are you consuming only 1000 calories with six weeks to go? How much further do you think you can reduce your calories and continue seeing reductions in body fat? Unfortunately, the answer is: you can't.    Effective Tactics For Physique Competition!   I'll cover each topic one by one, so by the end of this article you will be confident knowing that the package you display for your next competition will be your best! [ Click here to learn more. ]    It's important to remember that the function of stored body fat is to provide fuel for survival during times of prolonged famine. In your case, you are not eating enough calories - you're inducing a famine - and your body refuses to shed any fat. I suggest that you start eating more.   To test for water retention, I recommend depleting your glycogen stores. This will not only show you your true body fat percentage, but it will also shift your metabolism so that your main energy source is stored body fat instead of ingested carbohydrates.  If you are retaining water, insulin decreases resulting from glycogen depletion will result in water loss - a shedding of any water you are holding. You can then measure your body fat stores with precision.  [ Q ] I'm 20 years old and I've been training for one year. Here are my questions... Is there a way to be huge, as well as in top cardiovascular condition? I lift 4 times a week, as well as run upwards of 20 miles a week and I seem to be progressing in both areas fairly well. I supplement with creatine, protein, as well as ZMA, and I take a little Xenadrine for added energy.  I have a heart condition called cardiomyopathy and my doctors tell me that the most physical activity I should be doing is no more than a light jog a couple of times a week. I pretty much want to throw everything I have been told back into the faces of the people that have told me what I can and can't do.   A. Cardiomyopathy is a serious heart condition, and you should not only listen to your doctors, but discontinue the use of any stimulant products.   Stimulant products like Xenadrine state clearly that they are for use only by healthy adults. Do not mistake the seriousness of your potentially fatal condition - if you do, you're gambling your life.   What Is Cardiomyopathy? Cardiomyopathy is a serious disease in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed and doesn't work as well as it should. There may be multiple causes including viral infections.  Cardiomyopathy can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary cardiomyopathy can't be attributed to a specific cause, such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, artery diseases or congenital heart defects. Secondary cardiomyopathy is due to specific causes. It's often associated with diseases involving other organs as well as the heart.  The above notwithstanding, I congratulate you on your spirit and willingness to train hard and with enthusiasm. All that I think you need to do is shift your focus.  With a condition like yours, or with any health condition, the focus must be on becoming or staying well, and working within the realistic limits that you've been given.   The purpose of training is to improve the body and to enhance health - not to go all out, violate doctor's orders, and end up dead. The first step to shifting your focus toward health is to realize that it doesn't matter what other people think about you.  I'm continually surprised that people spend so much time focusing on what others think of them. The only thing that really matters is what you think of yourself. And, training is about the self.  It's about the body - making and keeping it healthy through an active lifestyle based on correct nutrition, correct exercise and correct supplementation. You will never accomplish anything if you're always focused on beating someone else, changing their views, or showing them how ""wrong"" their judgments about you are.  You have to be selfish with your training, you have to find your calling, and you have to make it all about you. Get a referral to a sports therapist or a conditioning specialist that can design an intelligent plan for your medical condition. Once you do that, find your purpose in the gym, and then go after it because it makes you a happier and healthier person.  There is a way to get ""huge"" and be in top cardiovascular condition: eat right, train right and be realistic. Getting into shape takes time. It takes hard work. If you're consistent, you'll get there naturally and safely.     Excerpt From 'Natural Bodybuilding': Training Method #2!

Research has found that women smokers can experience difficulties in getting pregnant. Women who smoke are putting their fertility at risk. Smoking also significantly increases the time it takes to conceive.   The greater the quantity of cigarettes smoked, the longer a woman is likely to take to achieve pregnancy. Smoking increases the chances of complications during pregnancy and labor. The risk of losing pregnancy increases with the number of cigarettes a woman smokes.  Smoking can harm the health of your child. Children born to maternal smokers are known to have weakened immune systems and be more susceptible to illness than children of non-smokers. Smoking can also seriously jeopardize men's fertility.  RELATED POLL Are You A Smoker?  Yes. Yes But I Want To Quit. No. I Used To Be But I Quit.     3.

Healthy Balanced Diet   Before and during the pregnancy it is so important to maintain healthy eating habits. A healthy diet will help to keep your hormone levels balanced and will provide your body with all the nutrition's it needs.   Try to start your healthy lifestyle sooner rather than later. Adopting a healthy diet is not about giving up all the food you like and enjoy; it is about taking responsibility for your own health and well being. Keep things simple. Changing your diet does not have to be complicated. By making small changes to your diet, you increase your chances of maintaining a healthy pregnancy.  What we eat effects our bodies and has an enormous impact on the functioning of our body's systems: from our circulatory system and nervous system to our digestion and reproductive organs. It can also affect our frame of mind.  I am encouraging you to eat lots of food rich in nutrients and essential food groups; all of which will contribute to your healthy pregnancy. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are crucial and play different roles in preparing the body for fertility and pregnancy. Carbohydrates are the body's basic fuel source. Click To Enlarge.Before And During Pregnancy It Is Important To Maintain Healthy Eating Habits.CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are vital for fertility. They help to maintain healthy hormone levels and balance sugar levels. Carbohydrates are divided into two categories: simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates.    Simple carbohydrates tend to produce a fast increase in insulin and blood sugar, but not much in the way of nutrients. Food sources include sugar, white breads, some snack foods made from refined white flour, and processed foods. In order to maintain a healthy blood sugar level, the amount of simple carbohydrates in diet should be kept to a minimum.  Complex carbohydrates are made of more complicated sugars and starches. They can help protect from high insulin levels and energy swings and can regulate bowel movements. Food sources include whole grain breads and cereals, brown rice, some vegetables, beans, certain fruits. They can help to maintain energy levels and provide you with some of the fiber your body needs. Click To Enlarge.Carbohydrates Maintain Healthy Hormone Levels And So Are Vital For Fertility.FatFat is a nutrient that, in the right form and right quantity, can balance hormone levels and support the circulatory system. Fats can be separated into two categories: saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats are found in meat, eggs, dairy products and some oils. The more saturated a fat, the harder it is for the body to digest, and this can lead to weight gain.    Unsaturated fats are found in nuts, seeds, grains, fish and olive oil. Good sources of essential fatty acids include oily fish, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds.  Protein Protein is an essential nutrition made up of amino acids. Protein is necessary for growing muscle and tissue and for making antibodies to help fight infections.

Overall, nutrition has a subtle but powerful effect on all of the body's systems including the reproductive system. Try to limit your intake of the following foods, wherever possible: salt, refined carbohydrates, caffeine, processed foods, fried foods, unpasteurized foods, alcohol, sugar, foods and drinks with added and sugary breakfast cereal, saturated fats, additives, preservatives.   3. Stress Reduction   Over time  stress can take its toll on the body and reproductive system. You may find it hard to sleep, lack energy, become irritable, suffer from digestive disorders and notice a decrease in sex drive.   The body is highly sensitive and will respond to stressful situations and periods of consistent stress in a number of ways. This may include interfering with the normal workings of the reproductive system - in both men and women.  In some cases a particularly stressful lifestyle that continues over a prolonged period of time may affect your fertility. The important thing here is to be aware of where the stress lies in your life and to take steps to minimize it. By recognizing where the stressful areas of your life are and taking small steps to alleviate them, you will start to feel more positive and in control and this will have a good effect on your health.  When we experience stress, our adrenal glands release the steroid hormone cortisol. If this is happening over a prolonged period of time, the excessive amount of cortisol in the body can upset the balance of other hormones.  In women, the hormone prolactin may be overproduced and interfere with normal ovulation, causing menstruation to become irregular. In men, research has shown that stress can lead to a drop in number of sperm with abnormalities. It is important that you do not let stress become just another aspect of your life. Identifying the cause of stress in your life is the first step in starting to overcome it. To minimize stress - relax. Relax - Relaxation can create a state of well being and improve your ability to cope.Breathe - The way you breathe reflects the amount of stress you are under. When you are feeling relaxed, your breathing will be calm. When you are feeling anxious or tense, you're breathing speeds up and become more irregular.Think Positively - Positive thoughts lead to positive results. We can often make stress worse by concentrating too much on the negative and allowing negative thoughts to overwhelm us. The idea of positive thinking is to challenge the negative thoughts that play over and over in your head.Massage - Is an excellent way of relieving stress and one of the oldest healing techniques.Sleep Well - Stress and anxiety are the most common causes of lack of sleep, which in turn becomes a main reason for stress. A good night sleep is essential for our mental and physical well being. This is why when we go without sleep for too long we become depressed, irritable, unfocused and more susceptible to illness.Click To Enlarge.Massage Is An Exellent Way To Relieve Stress.

Q & A With Clayton South - July 2008!
Clayton sorts out another list of questions relating to the tribulus, sesamin, man boobs, forskolin, and more. Read on!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/south_q_a_july08.htm,"Article Summary: Always speak with your doctor before taking any supplements. Muscular people have a testosterone dominated hormone profile. Exercise stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine.  [ Q ] I'm a college athlete and I am taking tribulus after having read about it in an article; it seems to be helping. I am concerned, though, that taking it may be against the NCAA banned drug policy. I am asking because while I can't find the name on the list of banned substances. It does boost testosterone, so I don't want to show positive on a drug test. What should I do?  Thank you.  [ A ] Before taking any dietary supplement it is always wise to talk with your doctor to make sure that you are healthy enough to take supplements. In your case, however, and especially because of NCAA regulations, you should check with your doctor and team officials prior to putting any supplement ingredient in your body.   There have been countless cases of athletes using dietary supplements that they thought were free of banned ingredients, only to find out that the product was contaminated with a banned substance, or that while the product was clean it worked so well as to produce a banned result - boosted testosterone levels - that could also be produced by a banned substance.  That being said, and provided that you are using a quality product from a quality company, I do not believe that you have anything to worry about. FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Tribulus?   With all the varying studies on Tribulus, I wanted to hear some real feedback from other members who have used it as a bodybuilding supplement.   Started By: fullarmor  Provided that you're using a high quality product from a reputable company, it is highly unlikely that your product will contain anything other than the ingredients listed on the label. If this product contains only tribulus as you say, then you will not show a positive result on any NCAA drug test.  The second reason that you have nothing to worry about is because of how tribulus works. While it is accurate to say that tribulus can boost testosterone, it is important to note that tribulus boosts testosterone by stimulating luteinizing hormone, through the stimulation of the pituitary gland in the brain.   Luteinizing Hormone Luteinizing hormone is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. In the female, an acute rise of LH - the LH surge - triggers ovulation. In the male it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone.   It is thought that this increase in luteinizing hormone increases free testosterone levels - meaning that it increases the amount of unbound and metabolically active testosterone that you naturally produce.   Doping tests of all kinds are designed to test for supraphysiological levels of testosterone - i.e. levels of testosterone so high that they could not have, under any circumstances, been produced naturally by your body and must have therefore been injected.  Testosterone Articles:  All About Testosterone! - By Virtual Muscle Increasing Testosterone Levels? - By Topic Of The Week The Big T. - By Planet Muscle Other Testosterone Articles...  Because tribulus does not increase your total testosterone count but instead increases only metabolically active testosterone levels, your total testosterone count will remain the same as far as drug testing is concerned. Therefore, no violation will be apparent on tests.  [ Q ] Can women use Sesamin? I am not a bodybuilder, but I just want to lose some fat. Will this product cause me to grow facial hair? Or, is there a better product for me? Something stimulant-free? Please help me; I'm trying to lose for my wedding/honeymoon.  [ A ] Yes, women can use Sesamin.   Sesamin is a natural fatty acid and fiber that's derived from sesame seed oil. Although there is some evidence to suggest that sesamin has a hormonal impact, and because of this it has become popular, it's important to understand the conditions under which sesamin may increase testosterone levels: primarily in circumstances of fatty acid deficiency or caloric restriction.  Because sesamin is a fatty acid, it is calorically dense, containing twice the amount of calories per gram as protein and carbohydrates. The fact that sesamin is high in calories is one of the reasons that it contributes to appetite suppression, but is also one of the reasons why it is a less-than-ideal weight loss agent. Sesamin does not affect facial hair growth in men or women.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Sesamin: Bye Bye Fatty!   In order to successfully lose fat, one must create a stimulus that tells the body to burn more fat and to stop storing/trying to store fat.   Author: Derek Charlebois   From your question, it is obvious to me that sesamin is not really appropriate for you and what you want to accomplish. Instead, and because you prefer to avoid stimulants, I'm going to suggest two things: diet and exercise.   When it comes to weight loss, the most important factor is nutrition. Fortunately, because simple weight loss is your goal, this is easily accomplished through nutritional means. Do the following:  Eliminate all simple sugars from your dietEliminate all junk food from your dietLimit sodium intake in your dietDrink at least 1 gallon of water dailyDon't drink diet soda as artificial sweeteners cause you to crave sugarIncrease fiber intakeIncrease protein intakeEat several times a dayEat your food from smaller platesEat less food As you can see, there is nothing complicated about these steps. They are very simple and, if followed, will produce very dramatic results very quickly for most people. Now, on to exercise.  Click Image To Enlarge.Nutrition Is The Most ImportantFactor When It Comes To Weight Loss.  The purpose of exercise with respect to weight loss is to increase your  metabolism and the amount of  calories that you burn. To do this, a combination of  cardiovascular exercise and resistance training is necessary. For simple weight loss that preserves muscle tissue, I recommend the following:   Do cardiovascular exercise five days per week, burning only between 300 and 350 calories per session, and keeping the cardiovascular exercise session between 35 and 45 minutes. Do resistance training three times per week, performing two exercises per body part, with two sets per exercise, with a per set repetition count of between 10 and 12 repetitions. Once again, the above recommendations are very simple and are easy to follow. The key to maximizing your metabolism is to combine cardiovascular exercise and resistance training, and to do both forms of these exercise consistently without too much of a break in between days in the gym. The other key to achieving success with this very easy to follow method is this: don't push yourself too hard.  I want to say a few things about this idea that you have to train as hard as possible and burn as many calories as possible every exercise session in the gym: you don't, and buying into this idea is a mistake that will lead only to overtraining and burnout. The fact is: if you push your body too hard, you will eventually become sick and burned out as your immune system will not be able to handle the stress. And, this may lead to weight gain, the opposite of what you want.  Overtraining Articles:  Overtrain If You Don't Want To Gain! - By Robert DiMaggio Overtraining: Signs & Solutions! - By Fawnia Dietrich High Frequency Training: Avoid Overtraining! - By Mike Mahler Other Overtraining Articles...  So, go slowly, and recognize that changes happen slowly, regardless of how hard you push yourself. Simply do enough to stimulate your body to change, and then leave the gym and rest.  If you do all of the above simple and easy to follow recommendations, I'm sure that you'll be very surprised at the results you get. Write me back and let me know of your success. [ Q ] Dear Clayton,  I have been working out for years and no matter what chest exercises I do, I still have man boobs. I can't get the fat to go away and the muscle to bulk up. I have tried lifting heavy weights, workout programs from fitness magazines. You name it and I've done it. Is there anything I can do to remedy this situation? Thanks.  Walid G. San Antonio, TX  [ A ] Thanks for the question. It's safe to say that if you have man boobs despite years of exercising, it is because your body fat levels are too high. Lowering them, then, should your first priority.   While it might seem that you could both add muscle and lose fat at the same time, the fact that you have man boobs tells me that your body fat levels are so high that it will be virtually impossible for you to build new muscle tissue until you have significantly lowered your overall body fat percentage. Why? Hormones.  Lean and muscular people have a hormone profile that is testosterone dominated, and for this reason these people can easily build muscle. Overweight people with higher-than-normal body fat percentages have a hormone profile that is estrogen dominated, characterized by chronically high insulin levels, and therefore can easily gain body fat while muscle growth is difficult. RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Training & Hormones!   Hormones are a busy bunch. From testosterone to cortisol there is a constant battle going on which should, at the very least, be understandable to the average person.   Author: Dave Draper  Therefore, because of these hormonal differences, two people with different body compositions can eat the same foods and react totally differently and with a different outcome.  Therefore, instead of trying to add muscle tissue by various workouts and methods, I recommend that you instead focus on losing body fat while maintaining your existing muscle mass. This is done primarily by the methods recommended above for the previous reader.  By eating well and exercising correctly, you will lose body fat while preserving muscle mass, and this in turn will make it easier to lose more body fat because your metabolism will stay elevated due to your metabolically active muscle mass. In this situation your testosterone-estrogen profile will also change in favour of testosterone, ultimately making long-term muscle growth easier. Click Image To Enlarge.Eating Well & Exercising CorrectlyWill Raise Your Metabolism. So, to conclude, by dropping body fat and maintaining muscle mass for the foreseeable future, you should be able to get your body fat levels down significantly and your hormone profile in favor of testosterone and muscle growth, after which time muscle growth will become a realistic possibility.  [ Q ] Hi. Can I take forskolin with Tenormin?  [ A ] I would highly recommend against taking forskolin if you are currently on the medicine Tenormin.   The prescription drug Tenormin is a beta-blocker that is prescribed by doctors to treat hypertension and other blood pressure problems. It powerfully affects your blood circulation and heart function.  Forskolin is a popular supplement because it raises cyclic AMP levels and powerfully burns fat, increases lean body mass and can even boost testosterone.1 Unfortunately, forskolin is also a vasodilator - it increases blood vessel diameter and increases circulation, and may therefore interact with Tenormin.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Forskolin & Testosterone.   I have been doing some research on forskolin. My question is does forskolin have any scientific backing that it actually helps to raise testosterone levels?   Started By: patriot1096   It is quite possible that from taking these two together, you may go from having hypertension - blood pressure that's too high - to having hypotension - blood pressure that's too low, which is equally, if not more, dangerous.   While I can understand that you probably want to use forskolin in place of other thermogenic agents, it's important that you do extensive research on these thermogenic ingredients when you're on medications for blood pressure. And always - ALWAYS - talk to your doctor BEFORE you take any supplement that may interfere with your medical treatment plan.  In my view, the non-stimulant route may be more appropriate for you, provided that the supplement you plan to use does not dramatically impact circulation and blood pressure - i.e. Arginine. Investigate further online and talk with your doctor to find out the best option for you. [ Q ] Hello Clayton, I am 16 years old. I have ADD/ADHD and I want to build some serious muscle. What can I do in the gym that will help me accomplish this? I don't want to take steroids - so what is the next best legal thing?  Thanks Ron.  [ A ] It's a good thing that you're not interested in steroids at your age, because you don't need them and they would do more harm than good. At your age, your  hormone profile is in rapid flux and, when it stabilizes at around 18-19, your  testosterone levels will be very high, making muscle growth easy - provided that you train and eat right.   Given your ADD/ADHD condition, finding the motivation to exercise will not be hard. ADD/ADHD is a neurologically based condition that is real and has been proven as real by neuroimaging science. The science shows clearly that, compared to non ADD/ADHD brains, people with ADD/ADHD have imbalances in the chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine.  Motivation Articles:  Maintaining A Balanced Focus With Motivation! - By Aaron Links Motivation: How To Achieve Your Goals. - By Fawnia Dietrich 10 Factors To Help You Stay Motivated. - By Shannon Clark Other Motivation Articles...  Exercise stimulates the release of both of these chemicals in exactly the same way as methylphenidate - also known as Ritalin - the most commonly prescribed drug treatment option for ADD/ADHD.  After years of research I am firmly convinced that the bodybuilding lifestyle is ideal for people with ADD/ADHD. Not only does exercise stimulate the same chemicals that are triggered by medicine, but exercise also prevents depression - a common occurrence in people with ADD/ADHD, especially those on stimulant medications.  What's more, bodybuilders eat frequently, thus ensuring constant and steady amino acid delivery to the body and even blood-glucose levels - both essential for people with ADD/ADHD to responds well to treatment.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Drugs In Bodybuilding!   To get an insider's look at this most contentious of issues, I recently spoke with a man who works with many top-level amateur bodybuilders.   Author: David Robson   Finally, bodybuilders use supplements like  multivitamins,  BCAA's and fatty acids, and research shows that people with ADD/ADHD are frequently deficient in minerals like  zinc, and in BCAA's and fatty acids and phospholipids. All of these ingredients play a role in optimizing brain function, and people with ADD/ADHD responds remarkably well - better than the average population - to using these supplements.   So, my advice to you is this: make sure your diet is spot-on, train as much as you need and no more, and get on a multivitamin, BCCA supplement, protein supplement and a fatty acid supplement. These are all legal and will get you great results at your age and with your condition. Good luck! Scientific References:  Michael P. Godard, Brad A. Johnson, Scott R.

Diet & Exercise Can Alter Metabolism.
Stay energized by improving your fitness level.  How diet and exercise can alter your metabolism.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pierce45.htm,"Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) can justifiably claim 60% to 75% of our Total Energy Expenditure (TEE). Simply put, TEE, is the total amount of energy that we expend throughout an entire day. Digestion and absorption of food is called the Thermogenic Effect of Feeding (TEF) and accounts for 5% to 10% of our TEE.  Energy expended via physical activity is called the Thermogenic Effect of Activity (TEA), which comprises roughly 20% to 30% of our TEE. Body Surface Area (BSA) is a major determinant of RMR, however, voluntary behaviors such as diet and exercise influence RMR in a positive manner.  Calorie restrictive diets can decrease RMR. I am sure that you have heard the story, someone diets in an extreme fashion and later regains their weight loss as they return to their normal eating patterns. Your metabolism is what you make it.  Scientific evidence notes that TEE is the most important value when attempting to manipulate energy balance. Let us probe further into the involuntary RMR, which has been and is currently utilized in countless research studies. RMR is measured resting following a 12-hour fast, which assists in controlling the impact that the TEF and TEA usually has on RMR.   Resting Metabolic Rate Calculator.  Bodybuilding.com has made your life a lot easier with these easy access fitness calculators. Calculate your rmr here.  [ Click here to learn more. ]   What is Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)?   What exactly is RMR? RMR represents all energy necessary to maintain respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. Specifically, it is thought that RMR is distributed as follows: (7%) kidney function, (10%) heart, (18%) skeletal muscle, (19%) brain function, (27%) liver function, and (19%) other vital processes.(1)  Figure 1. TEE = total kilocalories expended each day.   An estimated 60% to 75% = RMR, 20% to 30%= TEA,  & 5% to 10%= TEF(1).    Female AthleteAvg.

Compare three 30-year-old mesomorph females having identical height. The obese and average women have a low RMR per kg of body weight when compared to the athletic woman. Conversely this equates to the athletic female burns more calories per kg than does the other women.1  Interesting determinants of RMR include the phase of the female menstrual cycle and the release of thyroid hormones, which are categorized as catecholamines[Define]. The later events can actually increase RMR during times of fertilization.  Compellingly, when one restricts energy intake too severely a decrease in triiodothyronine (T3) and norepinephrine will lessen RMR. To a certain extent RMR is based solely from genetics, however RMR can be permanently altered. RMR will increase in reaction to extremes in the body's temperature.  Additionally, it is estimated that the luteal phase or fertile portion of the menstrual cycle can increase RMR by 5%. Ovulation occurs during the luteal phase when the female produces progesterone thus increasing body temperature.  The elevated temperature acts as an incubator for the maturing fertilized egg, granted conception has occurred. This increase in temperature involuntarily elevates the female's resting metabolism. Many factors of RMR are beyond our control, however voluntary behavioral changes such as diet and exercise, can influence RMR.1   Does Diet And Exercise Effect The Resting Metabolic Rate?   To answer the age old question does dieting decrease the RMR we look at a meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies focusing on diet and RMR were compared.  Thompson and coworkers have determined that RMR does indeed decrease to a significant degree when an individual is compliant with a diet regimen that is composed of less than 941 calories a day. For the record, the studies primarily targeted females between the 31 and 45 years old.  What about dieting with exercise? Will it make a bad situation worse? The same researchers conclude, if a healthy diet is prescribed by a qualified professional (in the US & Canada this is a Registered Dietitian) and the subject is well monitored, loss of FFM should be no more than 20% to 30% of the total weight loss. This amount is considered reasonable as researchers believe that the results of healthy weight loss is roughly 25% LBM and 75% adipose tissue (fat).  At first glance it seems as if exercise may allow an individual to maintain more LBM if they exercise while dieting.1   Don't Let Your Metabolism Fall.  These are the top ten ways you can boost your metabolism and keep it high - even through Fall.  [ Click here to learn more. ]  What about different types of exercise utilized during a period of caloric restriction, will this make a difference in RMR? In a 3-month study, 69 clinically obese females were assigned to 1 of 4 groups. There was a diet only ""control group"", diet and endurance exercise, diet and resistance training, and diet and endurance exercise plus resistance training group.  The subjects consumed a very low calorie liquid based diet containing 522 calories a day. Amazingly the changes in weight, body fat percentage, and LBM were not statistically different between all groups. However, a decline in RMR was noted and expected.  Due to the extremely low calorie diet an approximate decrease of 7% to 12% of RMR was observed in all groups. The effects of resistance training were measured utilizing a strength index calculated as the 1 repetition maximum (1 Rep Max).  Values for the bench press, latissimus pull-down, leg extension, and leg curl were studied. A 6% decrease in strength was noted in the diet only and in the diet plus endurance exercise group. Astonishingly a 10% strength increase was noted in the resistance-training group and a 3% increase was noted in the endurance plus resistance training group.  In these studies neither the endurance exercise group nor the resistance training exercise prevented the severe low calorie diet-induced decline in RMR and the individuals still had a significant increase in strength.1   The Impact Of Nutrition And Exercise On Both Sexes   This research thus far has targeted the female population, McCargar probed further to find results that were well rounded. This report focuses on the effects of nutrition and exercise and the impact that they have on body composition in both sexes.  The researchers Ballor and Poehlman examined 46 human studies in an effort to determine how training and gender influence body composition. All studies were at the minimum 4 weeks in duration. A diet restriction, and body composition determined by skin fold calipers or hydrostatic technique was conducted in each study.  The Metabolism Mystery Uncovered.  Learn how to change your metabolism to start burning fat all day long. In order to know what you must do to change it... [ Learn More ]  It is important to note that not all studies included an exercise program; therefore comparisons were differentiated between the diet groups and diet and exercise groups. Furthermore, differences were noted between the male and female subjects.  The fundamental findings revealed that the loss of LBM was significantly less in the diet and exercise group, additionally; this was consistent for both sexes. Approximately 72% of the weight loss was body fat and 28% of weight loss was from LBM in the males.  In female subjects 76% of weight loss was from body fat and 24% from LBM. The review of these studies revealed that the conservation of LBM was possible with modest resistance training done 3 times a week at a low to moderate intensity. That review crushed the common belief that it is harder for women than it is for men to lose weight. The females had an average of 4% more fat loss and a conservation of 4% more LBM than that of the male subjects.1   Does Increased Food Intake Increase RMR?   It takes energy to burn energy and there is scientific evidence that suggests an increased food intake increases RMR. This method has been exhibited in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa. Patients that participated in a professional nutritional replenishment program increased their RMR. If performed scientifically, increasing ones food intake can evolve a swell in RMR, a rise so colossal that it outweighs the possible increase in body mass.  It is widely known and accepted that exercise increases metabolism. To be precise the elevation in metabolism occurs during exercise and immediately following. A study, which revealed a statistically significant increase in RMR, was conducted. The subjects consisted of 18 individuals their ages averaged to 66 years old.  The study involved 10 males and 8 females who were embarking on a cycling regimen for 8 weeks. The subjects were going to cycle 3 days each week. During the first week subjects cycled at 60% of their maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) till 150 calories were combusted. In their eighth week, subjects cycled at 80% VO2 max till 300 calories were combusted.   Turbo Charge Your Metabolism With Extra Protein.  How many times have you started working out and then quit? In this article I will teach you...  [ Click here to learn more. ]  Their body weight did not change significantly; therefore it can be said that they did not gain or lose LBM or fat throughout the 8-week study. VO2 max increase was statistically significant. At the start of the program VO2 rose from 1.9 Liters of oxygen a minute (L/min) to 2.1 L/min.  When measured, cycling enhanced RMR by 11%. Pre-study the calories burned were 1.17 calories per minute versus the post-study results of 1.29 calories a minute. The noted increase in metabolism is not directly related to exercise alone, an energy flux had to have taken place.  Because the subjects did not experience weight change, an additional intake of food had to have been consumed in order to compensate for the extra energy expended in the study. This study reinforced what was found in the anorexic study, nutritional factors can change metabolism, in this instance the effect related to endurance exercise.  As depicted earlier, adequate nutritional intake appears to be vital in maintaining the energy producing processes of metabolism. For individuals attempting to lose weight, adequate intake complements exercise and restricted intake antagonizes exercise regimens.   Placing The Right Emphasis On Diet And Exercise   Maintaining an energy flux is important and it can be said that increasing LBM via resistance training should increase RMR. Although I advocate and firmly believe in diet and exercise in regards to weight loss, gaining LBM, and increasing RMR, people place unrealistic expectations on their regimens.  A researcher named Zelasko addressed this and stated that the way individuals perceive the role of exercise in weight loss and energy expenditure has become rather exaggerated through time. The major factor in losing fat is time, said Zelasko, and if TEE would be focused on, high intensity exercises would prevail.  Even though high intensity training uses a low percent of body fat, it disburses more fat energy as well as TEE. All this energy and fat utilization does not occur at that given time but rather in context of the entire day. TEE is critical in determining energy balance.  Most diet and exercise regimens will allow RMR to remain relatively fixed, however if a person increases their LBM they will burn more calories per kilogram of total bodyweight (Figure 2) thus enhancing their RMR. The TEF and TEA comprises the remaining energy expended factors, furthermore they are the most variable as well as the most likely to make a change.  Exercise regimens are of utmost importance, but emphasize on being consistent foremost, then utilize the acronym F.I.T., which stands for frequency, intensity, and time. Unplanned exercise and daily physical activity are also key factors when increasing RMR is the topic at hand.  Additionally, let us not forget my favorite phenomenon, the TEF; consuming tons of fibrous vegetables daily can increase your metabolism via the calories burned during digestion. Therefore it is the total amount of energy you expend in a day that should be considered if flourishing long-term weight reduction and maintenance is your ultimate goal.1   Conclusion   In culmination it can be said with statistical significance that diets restricting intake less than around 1000 calories a day should be avoided, as they can decrease RMR and furthermore antagonize the many benefits associated with exercise.  The suggested caloric intake falls within the REE and TEE, which represents a caloric restriction of 15%-20% for healthy and gradual weight reduction.  Exercise should be part of all weight reduction programs. Anaerobic activity done minimally 3 times a week at low to moderate intensity gradually increasing over time is suggested and adding resistance training will be advantageous allowing LBM and RMR to remain somewhat preserved.  TEE should be the main consideration in all strategies attempting to alter energy balance in a positive way. The TEF and TEA comprises up to 40% of TEE and they are the most variable and likely to make a change utilize them.  High intensity exercises have the greatest impact on TEE. If one increases these they have then shifted the normal curve positively in their favor and have made one of the most difficult things in the world become a reality.

My Journey Back To The Stage - Postpartum!
The journey back was much harder than I could have ever imagined.  I was prepared for the physical agony, but the emotional side... Read on to see how I made it back.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simone11.htm,"It took all of 1 year, 10 months and 10 days for me to return to the competitive stage. Although I had planned to return sooner, my priorities of being a mother first and a competitor second held me out longer than anticipated.The journey back was much harder than I could have ever imagined. I was prepared for the physical agony of getting my body back into shape, but the emotional aspect was a whole other ballgame. A Beautiful Baby Girl  July 17, 2003:My beautiful baby girl was born by an unexpected Cesarean section. I coached the OB the entire way through the surgery. I told him before the surgery that I needed the incision to be as low as possible so I could get back into my bikini, and then when he was stitching me up, I asked him to make my stitches pretty.  What Is A Cesarean Section? A caesarean section, or C-section, is a form of childbirth in which a surgical incision is made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies. It is usually performed when a vaginal delivery would lead to medical complications.  I bet he was glad when that surgery was over!! Although every time I've seen him since the surgery, he asks me how the scar looks and if I'm happy about it. I think he's proud of a job well done!! Post Delivery (162 lbs):Six weeks post surgery, I was cleared to start walking and at eight weeks Postpartum, I was given the green light to begin a normal exercise regimen. Although I tried to keep my diet clean and low carb, my pregnancy hormones only allowed for a minimal of cleanliness. 6 Months Postpartum (152 lbs):The first six months I spent nursing my newborn and although I wouldn't change a thing about giving my baby the best start possible, I had to make sacrifices in getting back to pre-pregnancy weight that I didn't anticipate. Nutrition: First of all, my body would not allow me to consume a low-carbohydrate diet and still produce enough milk for my growing baby. Each time I tried to cut back on carbohydrates my milk supply for the day decreased drastically, sometimes even to the point that I didn't have enough milk for some feedings and would have to supplement with formula, which didn't go over very well!I tried to keep to a clean diet and just eat whole wheat products, but my cravings got the best of me. I mostly craved hamburgers and pizza and anything that had anything to do with simple carbs. Come to find out I was still anemic from my pregnancy and from nursing, so once I got more iron pills, I felt much more energetic and the cravings weren't as strong.  What Is Anemia? Anemia, which literally means ""without blood,"" is a deficiency of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin. This results in a reduced ability of blood to transfer oxygen to the tissues. Hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in the red blood cells) has to be present to ensure adequate oxygenation of all body tissues and organs.  The three main causes of anemia include excessive blood loss (hemorrhage), excessive red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production.   Exercise: As far as exercising went, I continued to do cardio and plyometrics at my home and do resistance training with Avery as weight or my rubber bands. (See Working Out With Children Part 1 & Part 2). The gym was 30 minutes away and with nursing every couple of hours (from the time the baby starts to feed); I was unable to get to the gym in the evenings when my husband got home from work.  RECOMMENDED ARTICLE  Working Out With Children.   Getting back in shape after having a baby requires excellent time management! The more you can work child's play into your workout, the more time there is for everything else that needs to be taken care of during the day. [ Click here to learn more. ] Once she turned six months, however, I was able to take her to the nursery at the gym during the day. I was so excited to be able to get back into the gym and workout that I didn't know what to do with myself. My nutritional habits were getting back on track and I was feeling much better overall.Then I discovered some gold fish in Avery's baby carrier. I had peeked in on Avery a few times and had seen little girls playing with her, and realized that she was their little baby doll and they were trying to feed her. So being the protective parent that I am, I stopped going to the gym and opted to continue my at-home-workouts until she was big enough to hold her own in the nursery. One Year Postpartum (135 lbs):Luckily in the time being, a new gym opened within ten minutes of my home. I had envisioned myself competing again by this point in my post pregnancy life and frustration as well as depression; anxiety and a swarm of other emotions were beginning to take over my life.I had visited my doctor because I was feeling quite lethargic and couldn't figure out why. I thought that I might still be anemic as I had run out of iron pills, but all of the tests came back negative. Her suggestion to me would be a wake-up call. She said that I was probably depressed because my body was used to working out two to three times a day and eating a different way. Click Image To Enlarge.I Needed A Wake-Up Call.I knew that this was a possibility, but I wasn't willing to let it continue if that was the case. I had done everything in my power to give my baby the best start to life, protected her as best I could, spent every waking moment making sure she was reaching her developmental milestones through practice and repetition, but what I was neglecting was myself, and how could I give 100% of me to anyone if I wasn't 100% of me?I started going to the gym on a daily basis, and even got up to run in the mornings or did a second session at night after Avery went to bed. I did my detox diet that had previously worked for me. I tried three times before my hormones seemed to respond. I finally began to see results, both physically and emotionally. Click Image To Enlarge.I Finally Began To See Results. 17 Months Postpartum (128lbs):I decided to hire a personal trainer to take my training to the next level. I continued to lift four days a week and do plyometrics twice a week; however, now I had someone to push me through my plyometrics training sessions.I felt like I was part of an athletic team again and I was lovin' it! I also began lifting heavier now that I had a spotter. My strength increased drastically and I was able to do more pushups than ever before.  RELATED ARTICLE  How To Be The Best Spotter In The Gym!   There's more to spotting than simply pulling up on the bar or pushing up on the elbows. There is an art and science to effective spotting. Learn the best techniques here! [ Click here to learn more. ] What I did notice was lacking was my tumbling. Although I hadn't been a gymnast in 17 years, I never really lost my ability to tumble.Now that I've not tumbled at all in two years, my tumbling power has decreased tremendously. I'm guessing because my core strength is a lot weaker than it has ever been. 19 Months Postpartum (128lbs):Twelve weeks out from my first competition back I started to prepare my routine, costume and ordered a swimsuit. I was so excited about competing again, even though I was not 100% ready. Click Image To Enlarge.I Was So Excited!I set a goal for myself to have a routine prepared by the Pittsburgh show (May 28th), so no matter what I looked like, I was going. Since I was in competition mode, I decided to go to the Universe Show (June 24th) three weeks later as well.As I previously stated, my tumbling was not up to par and my core strength was lacking, so my routine was not as strong as it had been previous to my pregnancy. Although I love to dance, my dance choreography is almost non-existent, so needless to say, my entire routine was pieced together as well as possible for the Pittsburgh show.There were six competitors and I was just hoping to have the best show that I could. My mother, brother, husband, daughter and two friends from college came to watch me. It was wonderful to have such great support! What I noticed about myself prior to this competition was that it felt surreal and I wasn't going out there to win, I was just going out there to compete.I ended up falling on my back handspring back tuck combo in the beginning of the show, but finished up strong. When the bikini round came, I was actually trying to act like I had confidence. I knew that I didn't belong up on that stage. I wasn't ""feeling it"" at all.I guess I pulled some poise from somewhere because I placed 3rd in the bikini round and 4th in the fitness round and 4th overall out of six competitors. I was proud of myself for sticking to my goal, but at the same time I was disappointed in myself for not being 100% prepared. Click Image To Enlarge.I Pulled Some Poise From Somewhere.What made it all worth it to me was seeing my 22 month old out in the crowd cheering for me, and waving and blowing kisses to me. And when I finally got to see her, she said, ""yeah, mommy"" and clapped. 23 Months Postpartum (126 lbs):I really liked my Wiz theme and the music was awesome, so before the Universe show, I enlisted in the help of a friend of mine that does dance choreography. Most of my routine was changed and there were stunts that I could not perform at 100%, but the challenge of working hard to learn the routine was fun for me. Click Image To Enlarge.The Challenge Was Fun For Me.Again I went into the Universe competition disappointed that I was not at 100%; but proud that I had dedicated my life to my 23 month old, but still had the courage to take on the challenge of competing under unfavorable circumstances.I will have to say that this is the first time I've been away from my family since Avery was born, so that was difficult, but very much needed. So often we don't appreciate what we have until it's gone or we're away from the situation. I did have the support of my trainer and his girlfriend as well as my roommates, so that was nice.With that said, I was very nervous that I was going to forget my new routine. Then to top it off, we had to learn an opening number routine for the show. Man was I thrown for a loop as it was not listed in our schedule of events for the weekend. Yikes!!!Surprisingly enough, I nailed the opening number routine and I made it through my fitness routine. I'm assuming from repetition practice, because when I stepped off of the stage, I felt like a deer caught in headlights. After reviewing the routine on videotape, I really didn't think that it went as bad as I felt it had.However, my scores were quite low and one of the judges commented that I needed to stop thinking about what came next in the routine. Oops, I guess the ""deer caught in headlights"" expression did come across a bit. Nonetheless I was proud of myself for accomplishing a goal. Click Image To Enlarge.Oops! Conclusion Now I have to work hard to get to 100% competition shape and go out on stage with confidence and the attitude that I am going to win. There is nothing better than achieving a goal that you have worked so hard to achieve!

Thyroid - Ultimate Guide To Getting Lean
If you are having trouble losing body fat or you have hit that body weight plateau, then it is time to learn more about the ultimate factor – the thyroid.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drryan36.htm,"Whether you are the weekend athlete, soccer mom or a professional physique athlete your overall appearance is based on the same factor of a tiny little gland called the thyroid. This tiny little gland in your neck controls your hair, skin, eyes and every cell in the body.In your quest to become ultra lean or just shed a few pounds, your success is controlled by the tiny little organ. Several factors can go wrong and leave you bloated or just stuck on a treadmill confused about how you can drop those simple first four pounds. Making sure that your body is ready to get lean is one of the first steps of losing excess body fat.If you are having trouble losing body fat or you have hit that body weight plateau and cannot get your last few pounds off, then it is time to learn more about the ultimate factor controlling your bodyweight. Many other health conditions are closely associated with thyroid conditions.Thyroid problems often lead to hormonal problems, which can be very difficult to correct if left undetected. Several of our own habits can lead to a dysfunctional thyroid.The Basic ThyroidThe thyroid is a very small gland, shaped like a butterfly, it weighs less than 1 ounce and is usually located in the middle of the lower neck. The thyroid receives its information from the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. These are two glands located in the center of the brain. The pituitary gland stimulates the thyroid by producing a hormone called Thyroid Stimulating Hormone TSH.The thyroid produces two hormones that affect every single cell in the human body. Both of the thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), speed up your body's metabolism by affecting every cell at the cellular level.You're thyroid produces approximately 80% T4 and 20% T3. The affects of T3 on your body are very-very powerful and small amounts of the hormone have a powerful affect on your metabolism. Your body produces these hormones; the quality and quantity is monitored and controlled by the pituitary gland.The pituitary gland acts like a thermostat in your home and senses a high concentration of the T3 and/or T4 in your bloodstream. Once it senses a high-level of thyroid hormones, the pituitary produces very little TSH, if the blood levels are very low, then it produces larger amounts of TSH.The TSH stimulates the thyroid to absorb iodine and make T3 and T4. Various problems occur with the thyroid - Currently, the Centers for Disease Control indicate that approximately 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disease. People of all ages, races and sexes can get thyroid disease - Women are approximately 8 times more likely than men to have thyroid problems.What Causes The Thyroid Disease?There are several different causes of thyroid disease. At birth, the thyroid is located at the rear of the tongue and it migrates down to the middle of the lower part of the throat as a person matures. In some cases the thyroid does not migrate properly, although rare the displacement of the gland leads to various metabolism dysfunctions. Currently, science is looking at the exact location of the thyroid gland how that might relate to various diseases.More common causes of thyroid disease world wide is the lack of iodine in the diet. Other causes are ultraviolet radiation, medications and trauma round off the top list. In this article you will find that anything that affects the pituitary, hypothalamus or adrenal glands will have an affect on the thyroid.The Following Conditions Cause HypothyroidismIodine deficiency is a problem affecting approximately 100 million people around the world. Iodine is used by the thyroid to produce thyroxin (T3 & T4). In the 1950s the US virtually wiped out iodine deficiencies by using iodine salt.A nonfunctioning thyroid gland affects one in 4000 newborns. The child is either mentally and/or physically retarded if the problem is not corrected.Postpartum thyroiditis occurs in approximately 8% of women after giving birth. In most cases it is a temporary condition.Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. This can lower or raise the amount of hormones produced.Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a painless disease of the immune system that is usually hereditary, but has been linked with carpet cleaning.Common hypothyroidism symptoms include:FatigueFrequent-heavy menstrual periodsForgetfulnessWeight gainDry course hair and skinHoarse voiceIntolerance to coldAnd othersThe Following Conditions Cause HyperthyroidismGraves' disease results in the entire thyroid gland being overactive and producing too much hormone. This problem is also called diffuse toxic goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) and is often associated with a condition known as ""BUG EYES.""Nodules are often associated with an over active thyroid. A single nodule is called toxic autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, while several nodules are called a toxic multi-nodule goiter.Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland. This can raise the amount of hormones produced. More commonly associated with women after child birth, the painful or painless disorder results in hormones being stored in the thyroid gland and causes hyperthyroidism symptoms for up to several months.Excessive Iodine is found in many drugs such as some cough syrups (example: Amiodarone). The body often reacts by producing too much thyroxin to remove the excess iodine.Excessive long term use of stimulants (including thermal stimulants).Excessive long term high protein, low carb diets.Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include:IrritabilityNervousnessMuscle weaknessTremorsInfrequent short duration of menstrual periodsWeight lossSleep disturbancesEnlarged thyroid glandVision problems or conjunctivitisHeat sensitivityAnd othersOther FactorsOther factors affect your thyroid and include:StressIllness/diseaseOutside/inside temperatureHumidityBarometric pressureExposure to Sunshine (Ultraviolet radiation)Emotions (Good and Bad)Sleep (Too much or not enough or improper sleep)Environmental factors (toxins mostly)Diet and eating habitsDrugsAgeSex-male or femaleGenderSurgeryDoctor TestingNow if you suspect a thyroid problem, many times your family physician is the best place to start. More complicated issues are handled by doctors of internal medicine or endocrine specialist. Thyroid problems are very difficult to diagnose and other conditions often mask themselves as a possible thyroid problem.Most often they will ask for a thyroid blood test that will include the thyroid stimulating hormone test or TSHT. This test often can identify several thyroid disorders before you even get any of the above symptoms.If you can get one, you should always ask for a thyroid blood test, even if you don't have any symptoms, since this allows for some base information to go off of later in life.The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has reported that the screening for even mild thyroid dysfunction in men over 35 and women of all ages is cost-effective for the more common test such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Remember that fact if the insurance company refuses to pay for the testing.There are newer updated levels of thyroid TSH. Please ask your physician to update your test even if you were told you were normal in the past 6 months.New Light On The SubjectMuch of the problems associated with thyroid conditions-treatment-research are the same problems that follow many other diseases. We are treating people based upon the ""Old School"" of thinking.Unfortunately previous statistics and research have been based upon poorly worded protocols. If you do research on patients who have not been properly diagnosed, then publish the results, the information is screwed up and passed on to the next research trial.For example, not until 2003 did the North American spine society offer measurable definitions as to the distinction between disc bulges and disc herniations. Sounds silly, but the research for back pain has suffered tremendously due to improper use of terms and clinical trials have obvious suffered.Similarly, thyroid problems are often ill-defined and not well understood. Treatments are often skewed by improper terminology utilized by the medical professions.More and more articles are surfacing relative to these types of poor protocol. Dr. John C. Lowe, editor in chief of Thyroid Science has distinguished many of these points in the recently published article, ""How the False Beliefs in Conventional Clinic Thyroidology Came About."" Thyroid Science 1(12):E1, 2006Another hormone that needs testing is the Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). This hormone carries the thyroid hormone around in your blood stream. If you don't have enough TBG, then your thyroxin has nothing to carry it to the cells.Your levels of thyroid hormone will be second place and there will be very little benefit of testing for your levels of T3 and T4. If your levels of TBG are too high, then too much of the thyroid hormones are linked up and can't get to the cells.Other Major Hormonal FactorsLadies FirstThe female ovaries produce three different forms of estrogen and only one progesterone. That allows for the estrogen to become dominate very quickly. Thyroid hormones allow our cells to produce energy. Having high levels of estrogen causes the body to produce high levels of TBG. That estrogen dominance will quickly upset the balance of hormones. We will discuss that shortly.Many drugs are artificial and often lead to severe side effects. Bio-identical drugs are best to replace deficient hormonal production. This is the new phase of medication and pharmacological research that is present today. Making drugs, or using supplementation that is very similar to what your body naturally uses, allow for better absorption and less side effects.Cortisol For Men & WomenThe adrenal glands produce another important hormone called Cortisol. Without Cortisol, you will soon die from the slightest change in room temperature. Some of the effects of low cortisol levels are hypoglycemia, low blood sugar, but mostly fatigue. The effects of high cortisol hyperglycemia, elevated blood sugar, diabetes, excessive weight gain-primarily around the belly.Individuals with adrenal fatigue usually function reasonably well when life is stable but fall a part when stress is added. ""Roid Rage"" is often related to the adrenal fatigue, since the adrenal gland cannot balance the body's hormonal levels when artificial steroids are being used.The upset balance levels your system off and the control of changes is off. Pre Menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is another example of the poor effects of adrenal fatigue. These individuals are more likely to be vulnerable to infections and heal slower than those individuals with healthy adrenal glands.Other common side effects include headaches, joint or muscle pain, heart palpitations and other allergy type symptoms. Individuals with allergies should follow up with an endocrinologist for testing before they are doomed to living on allergy medications their whole lives.Adrenal gets its' Latin roots from ""ad"" meaning-near; ""renal"" meaning kidney. The glands sit on top of the kidneys and have an internal area called the medulla and the outer called the cortex. The inner medulla responds quickly to stress and produces epinephrine also called adrenaline.The outer cortex produces cortisol to handle long term stress. This allow for a quick response and a slower time released response to help us better cope with our changing environments.Cortisol primarily produces gluconeogenesis, which is the conversion of fats and proteins to sugar. In addition the presence of cortisol helps adrenaline elevate your body's heart rate. Cortisol is a corticosteroid, but unlike the other steroids in that same family, it is quite safe when prescribed at higher levels.Commonly prescribed for individuals who have Addison's disease, a relatively rare condition in which the adrenal gland is unable to produce enough cortisol.Symptoms & Signs Of Adrenal FatigueShort-Term SymptomsDizziness or light headedness upon standingMuscle and/or joint painIrregular menstrual cyclesInfertilityHeadachesLow libidoLong-Term SymptomsChronic fatigueLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)Low blood pressure (hypotension)Hair lossHeart palpitationsCold and heat intoleranceAnxiety or panic attacksDry skinObviously several of the symptoms some very similar to those of hypothyroidism. Both are clinically distinct conditions and blood work testing is conclusive to differentiate the two. Once again, high levels of estrogen or estrogen dominance can often times contribute to adrenal insufficiency.Another adrenal hormone is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The amount of DHEA produced by the adrenal cortex is greater than any of the other adrenal hormones, which includes androgens and the estrogens.Most individuals decrease their production of DHEA by the age of 30. Supplementation of DHEA is recommended past the age of 30 and also three to 6 mg of vitamin C per day to help boost immunity. Avoid caffeine, thermal stimulants, and alcohol; all of which stresses the adrenal glands.Adrenal insufficiency and/or adrenal fatigue affect about one out of four people in the US. It affects patients of all ages and both sexes. It will not present itself until 80 to 90% of the adrenal gland has been destroyed.In the United States about 70% of the primary adrenal insufficiency is due to auto immune processes. The rest of the 30% of the adrenal damages due to other causes such as:Tuberculosis (which is the most common world wide cause)Bacterial, viral and fungal infectionsAdrenal hemorrhageSpread of cancer to the adrenal glandsIt is rarely caused due to genetic abnormality of the adrenal glands.Lastly, the adrenal insufficiency can be caused due to a decrease in the production of the pituitary hormone known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is a pituitary messenger and it tells the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol. A pituitary tumor or other cause will result in the cortisol production being not stimulated. Long-term prednisone therapy will likely result in disruptions to the normal production of ACTH.You can quickly understand the complexity of the hormone system and how balance is the key element of control.Back To The ThyroidMost of the time, patients will obtain a thyroid test and be told that there are levels are within a normal range. As you can tell by the past few pages, testing a thyroid involves several factors and requires an expert to put together all of the results for proper interpretation.Testing the thyroid requires a T3 and T4 free and fixed. Testing should also require a TBG, cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, DHEA (when applicable) and other general factors to rule out other systemic diseases/conditions.You should realize that the standard ranges have been recently recalculated and new ranges have been published since Jan. 2007. You should also take note that several physicians may not be using the proper protocol and/or terminology.Thyroid conditions are extremely difficult to diagnose and treat. Importance has been shown in using bio-identical medications instead of artificially syndicated and synthesized drugs that have significant side effects.This table will help you to understand how doctors use blood test to rule in and rule out various conditions based on blood test.DiseaseCortisolACTHCushing disease (pituitary tumor making ACTH)HighHighAdrenal tumorHighLow""Ectopic"" ACTH (ACTH made by a tumor outside the pituitary, usually in the lung)LowHighAddison's disease (adrenal damage)LowHighHypopituitarismLowLowThis science is extremely complicated and physicians have to be on top of their game to be able to help you with these types of conditions. Just like with anything, some physicians are better than others at dealing with these types of problems.A through and intense case history and family history are the correct steps to beginning a successful hormone replacement therapy. Most of the time you should see a difference in the period of couple weeks.Make sure that she gave your physician lots of feedback and remember that they ""practice medicine."" Your results are not often as easy as a cookbook recipe. Trial and error will often result in a successful hormone situation."

HistorySince the dawn of time man has engaged in challenges of strength, dominance and competition. You can look at any period in human history and view this fact. From the samurai in Japan to the gladiators of the Roman Empire, to the jousting combatants in England, this had primarily been the sole domain of men and men alone, until most recent history.In our more civilized society humans generally prefer to use non-violent and means to compete; this is done through sports and games among other means. Bodybuilding continues this legacy in a non-violent manner in which men and now women can compete.Along with many any social changes that society has fought and won around the globe, is the right for women to engage in many activities in society that they had been barred from in the past, bodybuilding is one such activity.There was a time when being a female bodybuilder was unheard of and certainly taboo. Although, it is a sport still dominated by males, there are a number of world class female bodybuilders in the world today and a much higher number of recreational female bodybuilders than there was in the past.It is believed that the first legitimate bodybuilding competition for women took place in 1978 in Canton, Ohio. In 1980, the female bodybuilding competitions got their sanction. Named the National Physique Committee. 1980 was a breakthrough year as the Ms. Olympia was held for the first time.By comparison, the male's premier title, Mr. Olympia had its inaugural year in 1963. Though the development of bodybuilding as a sport is generally attributed to Eugene Sandow; as far back as the late 1800's. He started his bodybuilding paradigm with the ""strongman"" competition, later evolving his ideology to include development of muscle and posing in his shows.    Click To Enlarge.  2007 Olympia Winners: Jay Cutler & Iris Kyle.Differences What Are The Differences Between Male And Female Bodybuilding?The differences between male and female bodybuilding is evident at all levels of participation. It is important to make this distinction, as bodybuilding is enjoyed at all levels and encompasses the recreational, amateur and professional/competitive level bodybuilder. Certainly there are far more recreational bodybuilders than professional.At the competitive level, females are at a disadvantage in a direct comparison physiologically for the purposes of bodybuilding as it currently judges its competitors. Bodybuilding at the competitive level is judged by primarily by the competitors mass, definition, proportion, symmetry, stage presence and posing routine among other things.Females can compete through the same hard work to obtain all of the ingredients that a great bodybuilder is judged by except in the area of muscle mass. Testosterone levels and fat metabolism mechanism are the major difference in the physique differences.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Fat Metabolism!   Dietary fat is not an enemy. In fact, when adequate amounts of good fats (unsaturated) are consumed, it can improve one's health and athletic performance.   Author: Derek Beast CharleboisWomen do not have nearly the same amount of testosterone as males and this translates into the finished product that one sees onstage with far less mass. All things being equal, a female will have significantly less muscle mass than the male. Furthermore, the manner in which the female body metabolizes differs from the manner in which males do.Females generally have higher fat percentages than males, and they store it in different areas of the body, (hips and thighs, rather then the abdomen as males do). The body can more easily metabolize fat in the abdomen area then it can the thigh and hips.A further difference is that in many female bodybuilding competitions there are contests with titles that include words such as ""fitness"" in them. These contests seem to cater to the more accepted stereotype of the beauty and agility of the female body, rather than the muscular. These contests do not exist for male competitors.    Click To Enlarge.  2007 Fitness Olympia Competitors:Adela Garcia & Kimberly Klein.Other differences include a lower number of participants at all levels, though this is particularly true at the competitive level. Part of this has to do with the difference in available money for male bodybuilders versus their female counterparts. This extends to bodybuilding magazines and endorsements (how often have you seen a female bodybuilding on the cover of a mainstream bodybuilding magazine?).At the recreational level, in general, males engage in higher levels of bodybuilding supplement purchases, magazine purchases and bodybuilding equipment. Since the business is geared to males, it pays more to be a successful male bodybuilder, and in turn, males gravitate to the sport more than females.Diet, Training & Supplementation How Do Diet, Training And Supplementation Differ?Diet, training and supplementation do vary slightly between the two sexes; however, there are many similarities in these three components of bodybuilding as well and this must be explained in order to understand the differences. I will outline both in my response. Diet:High doses of protein are required to build muscle fibers after they are damaged by workouts. High calories are also needed to feed the muscles, maintain and/or grow, depending on ones bodybuilding goals. This is a universal truth regardless of gender.Muscle Fiber:Muscle Physiology - Oh Those Crazy Muscles! - By Eric BroserFiber Type Training. - By Dr. David RyanMuscle Fibers: How Do They Differ? - By Shannon ClarkOther Muscle Fiber Articles...What is different is the general requirements due to the size differences in competitors. A 260 pound professional male bodybuilder requires consumption of greater calories and protein than a 160 pound female bodybuilder to maintain and gain further muscle mass.Of course, this same concept applies to any two competitors of the same gender if there is a large discrepancy between weight; however, females in general compete at a much lower weight. Therefore the main difference between men and women exists in the quantities used.With women requiring more work than men in burning fat, many women use low carbohydrate diets and seek out foods that help increase metabolism to overcome some of the physiological disadvantages that females have.The diet for both men and women still requires the necessary calories and macro/micronutrients to achieve anabolic growth, and getting proper amount rest to grow, except, the body masses involved differ, although males do have a significant advantage in making progress due to testosterone advantages. Training:Training at the competitive level between the two sexes is more similar than different. The theories and practices that are required to develop muscle and/or decrease fat exist between both males and females.Both females and males need to increase their weight poundages, intensity and/or reps to break down muscle. This is because muscles in both sexes adapt to the work done in the past so a progressive workload is needed to force the body to grow and compensate for the increase in demands.Of course, due to males having a higher level of testosterone in the body, their bodies generally respond more dramatically to the increase in the workload, especially in the upper body where men enjoy an advantage in shoulder strength, though this same advantage does not exist proportionally in the lower body region.Testosterone:Increasing Testosterone Levels? - By Topic Of The WeekTestosterone Levels And Boosting Supplementation. - By Hugo RiveraAll About Testosterone! - By Virtual MuscleOther Testosterone Articles...   Click To Enlarge.  Male Bodybuilders Generally RespondMore Dramatically To An Increase In Workload.In regards to losing weight by training methods, both sexes follow the same approach. The theory of being calorie deficient suggests that one exerts, burns or puts out more energy (in calories) than one takes in. In contrast, having a calorie surplus; or taking in more calories than one burns, is needed to increase mass and size.This training approach goes hand in hand with ones diet as it will determine the amount of work done in the gym depending on one's goals. Women bodybuilders at the competitive level tend to include more cardio and high rep training to aid them in tightening up certain areas of the body, this is more easily achieved by their male counterparts who burn the excess fat more efficiently.Among recreational bodybuilders, there is a tendency for females to focus more on ""toning"" and shaping their bodies. This generally includes a lot more cardio with their bodybuilding to decrease their body fat composition.   Click To Enlarge.  Women Bodybuilders Generally Include A Lot More Cardio.Whereas male recreational bodybuilders tend to take an approach similar to professional bodybuilders in that they increase their weights and resistance but without the genetic advantages and dietary discipline that competitive bodybuilders enjoy and adhere to. Supplementation:Supplementation between both males and females differs depending on their bodybuilding goals. Women do tend to use more fat burning products due to their disadvantage in fat metabolizing, and along with diet, they adjust their requirements to meet their goals.Both men and women will gain the same benefits with increased protein, ATP replenishing effects in creatine, the same calories in mass gain formulas and such. There are numerous supplements marketed exclusively to females to try and overcome the physical differences, but these products are only marginally different.

View Creatine Products Sorted By Top Sellers Here.Steroids is a different issue to address, there are differences in the anabolic and androgenic effects on males versus females. In males, they generally suffer from a various degree of side effects as: breast development, shrinking of the testicles and many others. In females, the more common side effects include: enlargement of the clitoris, excessive growth of body hair and several others.Similarities What Are Some Of The Similarities Between Male And Female Bodybuilding?At the professional and competitive level, the similarities are astounding. All competitors are judged by the same standards in both gender competitions. As I have alluded to already, there exists the same requirements for bodybuilders of both genders to develop mass and ""cut-up"" in preparation for a contest.Of course, the exceptional dedication, demands and commitment to the development of the physique is required by both males and females and regardless of whether a bodybuilder is male or female; they handle and work through the same physical challenges.In the recreational bodybuilder, there is a desire by both men and female to increase their health and muscular attractiveness. This includes losing weight, muscle toning, increasing their cardio efficiency and using bodybuilding as a positive hobby and challenge. It is generally used an extension of a commitment to a healthier lifestyle and even to increase ones sexual attractiveness.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Look Great Naked!

Author: John BerardiThe Mainstream Male Bodybuilding Seems To Be More Mainstream Than Female Bodybuilding, Why Do You Think This Is?Male bodybuilding is more mainstream than female bodybuilding due to the double standard applied by society. Female bodies are viewed more appealing when they are curvy, somewhat soft and shapely. Men have more positively accepted and are viewed as appealing when they are muscular.A female is generally perceived as ""abnormal"" if she has the same muscular physique and hardness. Unfortunately, it is still viewed as going against society norms and ""unfeminine"" if a female bodybuilder has a great deal of muscle.Although much as the professional bodybuilding community accepts female bodybuilders, general society still views the female body through stereotypical models. For these reasons alone, many females who may want to become bodybuilders and who may in fact have the genetics and dedication to become great bodybuilders, shun away from even trying.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Can Pro Bodybuilding Go Mainstream?   Think back to when you were a kid and remember a few of the many sports that you enjoyed playing. Did any include bodybuilding? Probably not.  Author: Myron MielkeWith societies prejudices and opinions of what is ""normal,"" comes mainstream acceptance. Men go out to the gyms and buy the supplements and try to develop great strength and muscle size. In turn, businesses cater to the males in order to survive as an industry.Therefore, you will see in movies the muscular superhero; you will see on the cover of magazines the muscular male etc. It is not any different then the baking industry focusing on females as their main consumer. Society norms have dictated who is ""invited to the club"" and being a female bodybuilder is still viewed as being on the fringe of the community.    Click To Enlarge.  Is One More ""Normal"" Than The Other? Dayana Cadeau & Gina Aliotti.Finally, since bodybuilding is about size, mass and quality, and males have the obvious advantage, the common perception is that male bodybuilding is superior to female bodybuilding. Both require the same dedication and hard work, but due to the physical nature of the sport, females as a whole will never achieve what a male will.The same theory can be applied to most sports. The mainstream acceptance, although changing, still favors the male athletes and male sporting events. The number of male sporting leagues and attendance levels at the professional level far outweighs that of females.Therefore, where the money goes, business will follow, the visuals of muscular men will be far more evident than those of females and the perception that male bodybuilding as ""the big leagues"" will persist.Bibliography/References:www.bodybuilding.comwww.drugabuse.govwww.body-building-resource.comezinearticles.comhttp://sportsvl.com/rest/bodybuild.htmmuscle-pro.com 2nd Place - mawt View This Author's BodySpace Here. Bodybuilding was started as a solely male sport and the trend has not really changed even though female competitions have emerged. Female bodybuilding started in the 1970's and this did some justice to both genders.Women have never been known for strength and it has always been men who have been a symbol of power and muscularity which is the main reason female bodybuilding has not grown. Most argue that bodybuilding is less feminine and makes women lose their natural beauty.Early female physique contests were nothing more than bikini contests; the first U.S Women's National Physique Championship in Canton, Ohio is regarded as the first true female bodybuilding competition.Differences What Are The Differences Between Male And Female Bodybuilding? Natural Differences:While understanding the differences between male and female bodybuilding it is quite necessary to understand the difference in hormones that are naturally produced in the bodies of both males and females.The main differences being the natural production of testosterone in men while a very low production of the same hormone in the opposite gender. Testosterone being androgenic is the hormone that leads to natural muscle growth in men at puberty while estrogens in the female body lead to what we call a feminine body. So it is quite natural that women cannot naturally build a huge amount of muscle.The ratios of gains that come in naturally are at the ratio of about 1:10 with females not being able to gain anything close to what men can. With lower amounts of muscle and gains it becomes even harder to be a female bodybuilder. Competition:When coming to competition even the prize money differs with female bodybuilders being paid a lot lesser than their male counterparts which is discouraging and also means lesser appreciation for women in the sport. This is at times due to lesser sponsors for competitive female bodybuilding and at other times just because men are the ones who organize the shows.For example, at the 2005 Olympia, the men competed for a total prize fund of $550,000, while the women competed for only $71,000 (with an additional $55,000 available for the fitness contest, and $35,000 for the figure competition).So women have 2 extra fitness and figure competitions that are not held for men and are more popular at times. Figure competitions leading to fitness modeling, a career which has a lot of money involved.    Click To Enlarge.  2005 Olympia Competitors: Ronnie Coleman & Yaxeni Oriquen. Side Effects And The Use Of Steroids:Moreover when it comes to male bodybuilding affects such as hair loss, body hair and deepening of the voice even come naturally but when it comes to women these affects of steroids can cause serious problems. Women at times even lose their monthly cycle and get stretch marks on their skin so the sport becomes a bit more complex for them.RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Menstrual Irregularities & Dietary Recommendations.   It's likely you've heard about women losing their menstrual cycle. Learn about women, menstrual irregularities and dietary recommendations.  Author: Shannon ClarkEven when it comes to natural (dope tested) competitions, women aren't able to do much as men with their natural hormones - men can build quite a lot of muscle while women, without the use of testosterone based steroids, are only able to build a very small amount of muscle.So men still can build a noticeable amount of muscle without the use of steroids while women cannot. These steroids also have to be restricted as they harm estrogens which are in a large amount in the female body and this leads to complications. Body Fat Levels:Women have an extra water retention and fat problem due to natural estrogens in the body and body fat levels are not as low as in male competitive bodybuilding and so it becomes more difficult for women to lose fat and come more muscular on stage.Women tend to gain fat a lot more quickly and it is a lot more difficult for them to lose this fat due to low testosterone levels. Though this fat is a real nuisance when it comes to bodybuilding it does help in child birth.Pregnancy:What Is The Best Workout For Pregnant Women? - By Workout Of The WeekMy Journey Back To The Stage - Postpartum! - By Simone SziksaiWeight Training & Pregnancy! - By David RobsonOther Pregnancy Articles...Diet, Training & Supplementation How Do Diet, Training And Supplementation Differ? Diet:Talking about diet, it almost remains the same. Female bodybuilders have to be even stricter because of their higher levels of fat and it is an equally strict and tough routine as for male bodybuilders.It is the same for female bodybuilders when it comes to calorie consumption and muscle growth and when close to competition it is the same kind of hardcore dieting with as minimal cheating as possible.The recommended intake is almost the same with 1-2 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight to promote muscle growth and stay in an anabolic state. The same proportion also goes for the carbohydrate and fat intake but some female bodybuilders keep a lower fat intake depending on how they are able to control their body fat.// <![CDATA[function carbcalculate(){var bodymass2 = parseFloat(document.carb.bodymass2.value);	measurement2 = document.carb.measurement2.selectedIndex;	measurement2 = document.carb.measurement2.options[measurement2].value;			if (measurement2==2) {				kilo2 = (bodymass2 * 2.2);			} else {				kilo2 = bodymass2;			}var locarb = Math.round(kilo2 * 1);var hicarb = Math.round(kilo2 * 2);Get(""tcarb"").innerHTML =  locarb + ""-"" + hicarb + "" grams"";    }function reset2(){locarb = """";hicarb = """";Get(""tcarb"").innerHTML = locarb;document.carb.bodymass2.value="""";document.carb.measurement2.selectedIndex="""";}function Get( oName, oFrame, oDoc ) {	if( !oDoc ) { if( oFrame ) { oDoc = oFrame.document; } else { oDoc = window.document; } }	if( oDoc[oName] ) { return oDoc[oName]; } if( oDoc.all && oDoc.all[oName] ) { return oDoc.all[oName]; }	if( oDoc.getElementById && oDoc.getElementById(oName) ) { return oDoc.getElementById(oName); }	for( var x = 0; x < oDoc.forms.length; x++ ) { if( oDoc.forms[x][oName] ) { return oDoc.forms[x][oName]; } }	for( var x = 0; x < oDoc.anchors.length; x++ ) { if( oDoc.anchors[x].name == oName ) { return oDoc.anchors[x]; } }	for( var x = 0; document.layers && x < oDoc.layers.length; x++ ) {		var theOb = Get( oName, null, oDoc.layers[x].document ); if( theOb ) { return theOb; } }	if( !oFrame && window[oName] ) { return window[oName]; } if( oFrame && oFrame[oName] ) { return oFrame[oName]; }	for( var x = 0; oFrame && oFrame.frames && x < oFrame.frames.length; x++ ) {		var theOb = Get( oName, oFrame.frames[x], oFrame.frames[x].document ); if( theOb ) { return theOb; } }	return null;} // ]]>PROTEIN CALCULATORWeightSelect OnePoundsKilograms ResultsPROTEIN  Metabolism:Male and female bodies do not react in the same way to training and nutrition and the female body produces a lower amount of energy surge. Metabolism of the female body is a lot slower than the male body which means nutrients will not convert as fast into muscle.Metabolism:Energy Needs... What Are Your Calorie Requirements? - By BiologyBabeOvercome Your Slow Metabolism. - By David RobsonOther Metabolism Articles...The diet also needs to be a lot lower as women weigh a lot less than men. And with their weight being lower, women need less calories than men in the sport. Training:With a lower amount of muscle mass women in the sport are unable to lift as heavy as men and so their training is a little different from men. Women need more time in recovery and need more cardio in order to maintain their specific desirable fat levels. More rest is required as the metabolism is slower and so women are unable to be as frequent with their workouts. The monthly cycle is another hindrance to the training program and disrupts the process.Women have to workout with a lot of intensity to make up their inability to lift very heavy and this makes workouts almost as difficult as men.The main reason still being the hormones, with men having more testosterone, which helps in burning fat and building muscle while women having estrogen, does almost the opposite. So for women circuit training which can burn more calories is better and some extra cardio has to be incorporated in the routine to help in keeping the fat down.    Click To Enlarge.  Men Have More Testosterone, Which Helps Build Muscle, While Women Have Estrogen, Which Does Almost The Opposite.Again it is important to understand that women have a different hormonal composition and carry more fat and have a lower metabolism so training regimes should be constructed accordingly.Testosterone is what makes men aggressive so another drawback for women due to lower testosterone is the lack of aggression when it comes to workouts so this makes it a lot more difficult for female bodybuilders to keep their concentration on what they are doing.Women are naturally more flexible than men and so can perform some movements with much more ease than men without putting much pressure on the joints. Supplementation:The main difference is again hormonal. Natural testosterone boosters are not made for the female body and so are not taken by female athletes. Creatine requirements are lower and the same goes for protein shakes which makes the cost a little lower for women but they still have to and do train as hard as men.There are even separate vitamins and whey supplements for women such as Women's Whey and Optimum's Opti-Women, etc., and these are specially formulated according to the requirements of female bodybuilders. Female fat burners are even different at times as women carry more fat than men.    Click To Enlarge.

Competition Similarities:Almost all the poses with the exception of the most muscular pose are the same when both male and female bodybuilders step on stage.

Except for the cardio part which takes a larger proportion of the time that women workout; the rest is almost the same. Both use advanced methods like forced repetitions and supersets to increase workout intensity and stretching to maintain flexibility.The rest: the tanning process, the diet and preparation, and the off-season routine are almost the same for both genders and so there are not many differences in the approach of female bodybuilders towards the sport.The Mainstream Male Bodybuilding Seems To Be More Mainstream Than Female Bodybuilding, Why Do You Think This Is?Female bodybuilding has never been promoted the way its male counter part has been and has never even been funded in the same way for some amoral reason. Men have been known for their strength and aggressiveness and for their power to protect while women have always needed to be protected since ancient times and that is mainly due to strength differences given by nature and the way humans have evolved.Women have been known for their feminine characteristics of being delicate, weak and have been referred to beauty... and muscle is said to take away these characteristics - taking away a balance provided by nature. Moreover females are naturally unable to build almost any amount of muscle when compared to men and most argue that when their hormones do not support such growth then why should they force it.These thoughts are unconsciously in the minds of every individual who is related to the sport of competitive bodybuilding but not much is said about it. The lesser funds and prize give a clarion call that there is discrimination even in sports. Even after all the fuss about equal rights for women even sports haven't been free from discrimination.Plus female bodybuilding isn't very old; the first female bodybuilding competitions were not very ancient.Figure competitions are more appreciated as they do not take away the feminine characteristics of a woman and the competitors are later hired for photo shoots and contracts with magazines.To conclude it can be said that female bodybuilding, even though it is progressing, hasn't been as successful as its male version.

Another inspiring aspect of Bodybuilding.com's social network is when those same people make it a point to tell their stories and help others do the same. An exceptional person who exemplifies both of these characteristics is Christina Adler, otherwise known as redheadlaw7.  After struggling with a personal battle from postpartum psychosis, Christina found a much-needed release valve when she stumbled across the joys of fitness. With her daughter to thank as the initial motivator, Christina turned her newfound passion into more than just a hobby! As an NPC national athlete, Christina already has several shows under her belt and has long-term plans to make a push for her pro card - she has no plans of stopping until she achieves it!  Redheadlaw7 is living proof that if the mind can conceive the goal, then the body can make it possible. Check out the one-on-one interview where she reveals all. Don't miss this great opportunity to be inspired by the newest BodySpace Member of the Month. Tell us a little about yourself. My name is Christina Adler. I am a 38-year-old wife and mother to two daughters. I like to call myself a ""recovering attorney"". I gave up practicing law so I can continue to write fitness and nutrition articles and blog on my postpartum recovery site www.redheadlaw7.com.    She may not be practicing anymore, but redheadlaw7 still lays down the law in the gym.How long have you been visiting Bodybuilding.com and using BodySpace? I have been a member for a little more than two years now. What was it that led you to decide to start focusing on your health and fitness? After having my second child, I suffered from postpartum psychosis, which led to me being overweight, overmedicated and miserable. My oldest daughter begged me to go to mommy-daughter yoga class with her because she wanted her mommy to feel better. From that point on, I started making my health a big priority in my life. I started taking Pilates classes, and then I got addicted to Les Mills' BODYPUMP. Eventually I hired a personal trainer to help push myself a little further. Now I'm hooked. Do you compete, or do you stay so dedicated for other reasons? Yes I do compete. I have several local and NPC contests under my belt and I recently qualified to compete in the NPC on the national level in both masters and open figure. I have several contests scheduled for the fall and I plan to compete until I get my pro card. It may take a few years, but I'm not one to back away from a challenge. What is the most important thing you've learned since you started training? I think this is a tie between learning how important nutrition is to build a body and that lifting heavy weights is not going to make a female big and bulky. I would have started eating way more and I would have hired a trainer sooner if I knew what I know now. I can never emphasize enough how important it is that women work out with trainers or lifting partners that can push them harder and farther in the gym. You never know just how hard you can push yourself if you always fear getting trapped under a bar or dropping something. What is your favorite body part to train and why? I absolutely love training legs. I love setting PRs with legs and I love the days after when I can barely sit down or stand up. It's those days that I feel like I've really accomplished something.    Can you believe that redheadlaw7 loves training legs?What is the best fitness advice you could give to someone who is just starting? I think the best thing any person can do is find a good trainer and have them get you familiar with the gym, the equipment and your body. Yeah, it may be a little expensive, but so is wasted time. I know so many people who are willing to spend a ton of money on hair or clothing so they can look good, but think hiring a trainer is a luxury.  I think if you have a set plan that suits you best, you can spend way less time in the gym puttering around and spinning your wheels on exercises that aren't going to help you reach your full potential. Once you get yourself into shape you can worry less about dolling yourself up to look good. In the end, you've spent a little more money to look and feel fabulous in whatever you're wearing. How often do you treat yourself to a cheat food and what is your favorite? I am very embarrassed to say that I treat myself to cheat foods way too often. My biggest weakness is something I came up with while doing the Ketogenic diet. I would mix cream cheese, crunchy peanut butter and cocoa powder together and it tasted just like cheesecake. Now that I'm in the middle of contest prep I can't have any dairy so I treat myself to dark chocolate and peanut butter flavored almonds. They are to die for, but so hard to stop eating once I get started. Why do you think BodySpace would be beneficial to others? I don't think there is a better place to go to exchange ideas, tips, advice or inspiration having to do with nutrition or fitness. The site is packed with competitors, trainers, dietitians and beginners and everyone is so happy and willing to offer up their knowledge and support. And one of my favorite parts of BodySpace is being able to watch people's progress and view inspirational photos.  They always say a picture is worth a thousand words and when people see the truly inspirational profiles on your main page I don't think there's any better example. There's proof right there that it can be done. BodySpaceBodySpace is your key to bodybuilding, transformation, or fitness success. Create your profile, start a BodyBlog, meet others with similar goals, and share information. Join the largest    online fitness communityWhat are your future fitness goals? I plan on competing as long as my body holds up and I hope to continue to be an inspiration to others. Is there anything you would like to say to all the BodySpace people out there?

Body Transformation: JoAnn Rivas Regained Her Physical And Mental Fortitude
In order to improve one's quality of life, JoAnn believes that one must change her emotional self as well as her physical self.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/body-transformation-joann-rivas-regained-her-fortitude.html,"Vital Stats     Name: JoAnn Rivas Email: fitnessjo89@gmail.com  Location: Williamsburg, VAWhy I decided to transformIn the summer of 2012, we took a family photo, and the sight of it made me burst into tears. I'd had a baby earlier that year, and was trying to get the weight off, but nothing seemed to be working.The body changes after having a baby, and I didn't know this ""new"" body I was in. I didn't like it either. That picture ignited a fire within me that has yet to burn out. I wanted to not just look great on the outside, but feel great on the inside as well.At first, my reasons to transform were for me and what I wanted. As I continued on my journey, I realized I was doing this for my family as well. I wanted to be a good influence for my son; to instill in him the ideals of a healthy and active lifestyle.I also wanted to encourage my other family members and close friends to invest in their own bodies, health, and future.How I accomplished my goalsI knew that I first had to get my diet under control. For the remainder of that year, I learned which foods did and did not work for my body. I ate five meals a day and only drank water or green tea. By doing just these things, I lost about 10 pounds.Before /// 175 lbsAfter /// 120 lbsAGE 23 / HEIGHT 5'0"" / BODY FAT 30%AGE 24 / HEIGHT 5'0"" / BODY FAT 18%Post To FitboardIn January 2013, I weighed 175 pounds, and I made it my New Year's resolution to really focus on fitness. I started running, and then began to incorporate yoga into my lifestyle as a fun challenge. By May 2013 I was down to 145 pounds, and began weightlifting with the guidance of Jamie Eason's 12-Week LiveFit Trainer. I've been hooked on weightlifting ever since. By July 2013 I was down to 130 pounds, all the while still eating very clean.There were definitely days when I wanted to just lie in bed, not go to the gym, and eat pizza and cookies all day. I overcame these obstacles through motivational audios and the encouragement of my other half. He had played college football for 5 years, so seeing him push his body to the limit and give his all to every workout filled me with so much inspiration. His drive and passion were contagious, and only forced me to dig deep and find my own.One weird trick I used was listening to audio compilations by Eric Thomas, Will Smith, and Ray Lewis every night. As soon as I woke up in the morning, I would hear their words freshly swirling around in my head, reminding me of my mission. I also stayed accountable and motivated by starting a blog. I tracked my workouts here, posted recipes, and shared progress pictures.The feedback I received from sharing my fitness journey was overwhelming and so positive that it only pushed me to get up the next morning and do it all again, one day at a time.Apply Here To Be A Transformation Of The Week!Bodybuilding.com honors people across all transformation categories for their hard work and dedication.

How To Get A Celeb Body That Will Burn Up The Red Carpet!
Women - Do celebs manage to get into such great shape in a short amount of time? Not really. They work at keeping their bodies buff year-round. Use the following proven tips and workout to get that sexy look so many of you are looking for!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/celebbody.htm,"How many of us haven't stood in line waiting to pay in a grocery store and at the same time glanced through one of many gossip magazines placed in the aisle next to the cashier. Reading about, and envying the pictures of the celebs looking amazing on the red carpet for the Oscar's, The Grammies and other events helps us escape our normal everyday life.  We'll see actresses such as ""Dreamgirls"" diva Beyonc Knowles, ""Volver"" star Penelope Cruz and Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon in designer dresses that show off shoulders and backs, legs and arms. Some may even go as far as peek-a-boo cut-outs that reveal sculpted six-pack abs.  But do celebs actually manage to get into such great shape in the short amount of time between the time nominations are announced and when the awards are presented?  No, not really. They work at keeping their bodies buff year-round, with some extra-special attention in the weeks leading up to these events.  I am sure many of us right then at that moment in the store or when reading the magazine at home are determined to reach that look. But unfortunately the dream stops when you drive past the doughnut store and stop to get your cravings satisfied, or when your kids call your cell phone and you have to skip gym to pick them up.  The biggest enemy for us women is excuses. And do you know what? Only we can make them up, and only we can prevent us from making them.  I have to take care of the kidsClean the houseDo grocery shoppingMake the laundryTake care of my husbandWatch the latest episode of some reality showWorkAnd more... and more Oh well at least the thought was good while it lasted.  Stop! No it doesn't have to end like this. You have to show yourself that you can change your mindset from weak to strong. Only YOU can make it happen.  Even if you have the best trainer out there, maybe Madonna's trainer or if you have all time in your life it won't matter as long as your mind is weak, because you will still give up even if you have everything served in front of you. You are in charge of your body and only you can set the limits of what you can do to reach your goals.  Click To Enlarge.You Are In Charge Of Your BodyAnd Only You Can Set The Limits! Keep the picture of the body you want in your head and then every time you feel weak for temptations or have excuses, bring it up. What do you want, the doughnut or a fit body? It's your choice. To fulfill and achieve something that makes you feel good will actually make you a better mother and wife too. It can make life much harder to love others if you can't love yourself. Never forget yourself!  I have been there too, trust me. I have been in the fitness industry for over 15 years. My career started when my son was a baby and I was a single mother. I was making the same excuses and trying to blame my surrounding for not being able to get the results I wanted. But after knocking my head in the wall several times I finally woke up and had a conversation with the inner me. Yes, this might sound crazy but it helped.

I always loved training and to be in control of my body, so I needed to follow through to feel satisfied and complete. To feel good about yourself will make you a better mom and person too. I put a picture in my head of what I wanted to look like and that was what I was working for.  I made up a plan to be able to schedule my training and diet into my busy schedule. I brought my baby to the gym and I took him in the stroller on my power walks. I tried to look at the positive sides more than the negative.

Author: Jennifer Nicole Lee  Now 15 years later I still prepare myself mentally and physically with a good plan for any upcoming challenges. If I keep my goal in my head then I know I will get there.  I have had the honor of walking the red carpet many of times and last year I had a great time walking the red carpet at an event in Hollywood with my friend Sherry Goggin. This was a great opportunity to get publicity and recognition and I knew I needed to look my best in front of all the photographers.  You have to be able to show off without feeling uncomfortable or shy. Because I had done my home work on my training, diet and supplementation I was now able to wear my short lovely dress and high heels and to shine like a movie star.  Well here is news for you! You can look sexy and shapely enough to hit the red carpet too!  Click To Enlarge.You Can Look Sexy & Shapely EnoughTo Hit The Red Carpet Too! I have been training Sherry Goggin and many clients to help them get in shape for events and I give them a consistent exercise program that fits into their lifestyle that they can do most days of the week. They have also been given a diet plan and supplement plan that will provide them with a perfect balance of nutrients that will boost their metabolism.  This will make them start burning fat while building and shaping their bodies. This gets them into a place where they are strong, fit and - or close to - their ideal bodyweight.  You can do it too. If you want arms like Madonna, legs like Cameron Diaz or a butt like Jenifer Lopez, then get ready to change your mindset and take action of your training and diet.  Start Your Preparation  To start your preparation you need the following:  Find a picture of a celebrity or person that you would like to have as your role model. Put the picture in your office or on your fridge. Somewhere where you easy can see it. Clean up your fridge from food that contains sugar and non essential fat. Throw it all in the trash can.

Time to fill up the fridge with healthy choices. Your main food should consist of brown rice, whole grains (whole grain bread, wholegrain pasta), chicken, turkey, lean meat, fish, vegetables (broccoli, green beans, asparagus and others leafy greens) and low fat dairy products.

For your cardio workouts, increase the intensity by going up in levels on the machines or adding some sprints or hills to your runs/walks so that you are burning more calories and really getting a good sweat. For the strength part of your workouts, focus on alternating workouts of heavier weights/fewer reps with lighter weights/more reps to challenge your muscles in different ways.

The day before the event, I recommend sticking with lean proteins and complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, and limiting fruit and veggies to avoid feeling bloated or gassy.

Recapture Your Form: 5 At-Home Post-Pregnancy Circuit Routines!
Not sure how to fit fitness into your schedule as a new mom? Try these quick, do-it-at-home workouts.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/recapture-your-form-5-post-pregnancy-circuits.html,"The arrival of your bundle of joy means saying goodbye to the giant orb your midsection grew to the last nine months. You also no longer have to worry about random people touching that giant orb as if it wasn't actually part of your body. Despite the incredible joys you might experience having your child, you might have some weight-related worries lingering around. Perhaps it is not surprising that studies show most women gain an average of about 30 pounds during pregnancy. Many of us end up gaining way more than that! There is good news! Within a month after giving birth, most women lose approximately 18-to-20 pounds. But what do we do when the body takes a ""pregnant pause"" shedding those extra ten pounds? Your body might be different after your pregnancy, but that doesn't mean it's incapable of losing that weight. You just need a little patience and consistent exercise, not to mention a healthy, clean diet to get back into shape.I get it though, trust me. Working out is the LAST thing you want to do when you're only getting a few hours of sleep and you feel exhausted. But even short, easy workouts can help you sustain energy through the day, restore your abdominal muscle tone, improve your mood, relieve stress and permit you to sleep better at night. Exercise is also helpful to control postpartum depression. According to a 2009 study, ""Home-based exercise is an effective and feasible intervention for alleviating symptoms of depressed mood in the postpartum."" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggests you can begin exercising when you feel ready, but you need to talk with your doctor before you begin a program. The ACOG also explains that if you've had a cesarean or difficult birth, it may take a bit longer to feel ready for exercise. The following circuit routines can be done in 15 minutes! They are safe, effective and can be incorporated into your busy schedule. What's the best part about them? You can do them at home!Each of these exercises can be tailored to fit your goals. If you are new to working out, try using lighter weight. If you are used to being active, use heavier weight or increase the intensity of the repetitions or sets.Do them every other day; you need to get a good day of rest between on-days.If you'd like to up the ante, try doing these circuits twice per day.To do these home workouts, you need a yoga mat, dumbbells, stability ball, bench or a chair. You can find these items in any sports store. Or, you can use things from home.Do all moves one after another; rest 10 seconds between each exercise. Repeat circuit three times. Add more activities to this routine like going for a stroll with your baby, walking in the mall, using stairs instead of elevator ore playing outside with your kids. Warm up and stretch before you begin training. After you are done, include some cool-down activities and stretching.

Bodybuilding Can Help You Beat Some Forms Of Depression.
Depression comes in many forms but all affect your life in one way or the other... There are several steps you can take to fight back against mild forms of depression.  Luckily, weightlifting is one of them. Find out more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bodybuilding_helps_depression.htm,"Article Summary: Depression is typically chronic and can drastically impair a person's life. Depression can be reliably diagnosed in primary care. Depression is common, affecting about 121 million people worldwide.  Bodybuilding Can Help You Beat Some Forms Of Depression   Depression comes in many forms but all affect your life in one way or the other, either temporarily or over a longer period of time. And, the current world events, war, aftermath of the mortgage crisis and stock market plunge are enough to make anyone melancholy. There are several steps you can take to fight back against mild forms of depression. Luckily, weightlifting is one of them.  What Is Depression?  Depression is a common mental disorder. Though the severity and symptoms of depression vary from person to person, they often include some or all of the following: persistent sad mood, irritability, loss of interest or pleasure in life events, poor concentration, sleep irregularities, low energy and low self worth.  Unlike a fleeting sad day, depression is typically chronic or recurrent and can drastically impair a person's life. Major bouts of depression can lead to suicide, which claims approximately 850,000 lives yearly.     Click To Enlarge.  Depression Is A Common Mental Disorder.  Unlike some diseases that affect certain groups of people more than others, depression can occur in anyone, at any age and from any background. Depression falls into several clinical diagnoses. Here are some common forms:   Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):     Seasonal Affective Disorder has symptoms that are seen with any major depressive episode. It is the recurrence of the symptoms during certain seasons that is the hallmark of this type of depression.   Like many people, you may develop cabin fever during the winter months. Or you may find yourself eating more or sleeping more when the temperature drops and darkness falls earlier. While those are common and normal reactions to the changing seasons, people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) experience a much more serious reaction when summer shifts to fall and on to winter.   Cabin Fever: Cabin fever is an idiomatic term for a claustrophobic reaction that takes place when a person or group is isolated and/or shut in, for an extended period. Symptoms include restlessness, irritability, forgetfulness, laughter, and excessive sleeping.    With seasonal affective disorder, fall's short days and long nights may trigger feelings of depression, lethargy, fatigue and other problems. Don't brush this off as simply a case of the ""winter blues"" that you have to tough out on your own.   Seasonal affective disorder is a type of depression, and it can severely impair your daily life. That said, treatment - which may include light box therapy - can help you successfully manage seasonal affective disorder. You don't have to dread the dawning of each fall or winter.  Seasonal affective disorder is a cyclic, seasonal condition. This means that signs and symptoms usually come back and go away at the same times every year.  Click Image To Enlarge.People With Seasonal Affective Disorder Experience ASerious Reaction When Summer Shifts To Fall And On To Winter.  Usually, seasonal affective disorder symptoms appear during late fall or early winter and go away during the warmer, sunnier days of spring and summer. But some people have the opposite pattern, developing seasonal affective disorder with the onset of spring or summer. In either case, problems may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses.   Postpartum Depression:     Postpartum Depression is a type of depression that can occur in women who have recently given birth. It typically occurs in the first few months after delivery, but can happen within the first year after giving birth. The symptoms are those seen with any major depressive episode.   Often, postpartum depression interferes with the mother's ability to bond with her newborn. It is very important to seek help if you are experiencing postpartum depression.

If you want to lose weight and be healthier than start your program immediately. Start NOW!   Author: John DeFendis   Postpartum depression is different from the ""Baby Blues"", which tend to occur the first few days after delivery and resolve spontaneously. The birth of a baby can trigger a jumble of powerful emotions, from excitement and joy to fear and anxiety. But it can also result in something you might not expect - depression.   Many new moms experience the baby blues after childbirth. An estimated 10 percent of new moms experience a more severe form of emotional distress known as postpartum depression. Rarely, an extreme form of postpartum depression known as postpartum psychosis develops after childbirth.   Postpartum Psychosis: Postpartum psychosis or (also sometimes referred to as puerperal psychosis or postnatal psychosis), is a mental illness, which involves the rapid onset of psychotic symptoms in a woman following childbirth.   Although sometimes confused with postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis is a different disorder and is much less common. Postpartum psychosis is also known as ""postnatal stress disorder"", because the patient is under emotional stress and exhibits unusual behavioral patterns not seen before their pregnancy or postpartum event.    Postpartum depression isn't a character flaw or a weakness. Sometimes postpartum depression is simply part of giving birth. If you have postpartum depression, prompt treatment can help you manage your symptoms - and enjoy your baby.   Bipolar Disorder:     Bipolar disorder, another mood disorder, is different than major depressive disorder and has different treatments. For more information go to  bipolar.com.   SIGNS & SYMPTOMS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER Bipolar disorder is a condition in which people experience abnormally elevated (manic or hypomanic) and abnormally depressed states for short, or significant periods of time; in a way that interferes with functioning. Bipolar disorder has been estimated to affect more than 5 million Americans-about 3 out of every 100 adults.   It affects people without regard to age, race, ethnicity, gender, education or occupation. Not everyone's symptoms are the same and there is no blood test to confirm the disorder. Scientists believe that bipolar disorder may be caused when chemicals in the brain are out of balance.   Bipolar disorder can look like depression. Distinguishing the illness is tricky, even for mental health professionals. What makes bipolar disorder different is that in addition to depression, a person also experiences the ""highs"" of a manic phase.[ http://en.wikipedia.org ]  Symptoms Of Depression  Major depressive disorder, commonly referred to as ""depression,"" can severely disrupt your life, affecting your appetite, sleep, work, and relationships. The symptoms that help a doctor identify depression include:  Constant feelings of sadness, irritability, or tensionDecreased interest or pleasure in usual activities or hobbiesLoss of energy, feeling tired despite lack of activityA change in appetite, with significant weight loss or weight gainA change in sleeping patterns, such as difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or sleeping too muchRestlessness or feeling slowed downDecreased ability to make decisions or concentrateFeelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or guilt thoughts of suicide or deathDepression is common, affecting about 121 million people worldwideDepression is among the leading causes of disability worldwideDepression can be reliably diagnosed and treated in primary careFewer than 25% of those affected have access to effective treatments Depression can be reliably diagnosed in primary care. Antidepressant medications and brief, structured forms of psychotherapy are effective for 60-80% of those affected and can be delivered in primary care. However, fewer than 25% of those affected (in some countries fewer than 10%) receive such treatments.  Barriers to effective care include the lack of resources, lack of trained providers, and the social stigma associated with mental disorders including depression.     Click To Enlarge.  Depression Can Be Reliably Diagnosed In Primary Care.  Whatever its cause, depression is not just a state of mind. It is related to physical changes in the brain, and connected to an imbalance of a type of chemical that carries signals in your brain and nerves. These chemicals are called neurotransmitters.  Risk Factors  Oftentimes there isn't one single factor that causes depression but instead a combination of contributing causes. Although a serious life event such as death, chronic illness, financial problems or abuse can trigger a depressive episode or worsen existing depression, experts say that a combination of genetic, psychological and environmental factors are often involved. Some of these include:  Family History (especially in the case of bipolar disorder and major depression) Trauma and stress Pessimistic personality Stress Trauma Serious medical conditions Other psychological disorders Physical changes. After childbirth, a dramatic drop in estrogen and progesterone may contribute to postpartum depression. The hormones produced by your thyroid gland also may drop sharply - which can leave you feeling tired, sluggish and depressed. Changes in your blood volume, blood pressure, immune system and metabolism can lead to fatigue and mood swings.  Topic Of The Week:How To Combat Depression.  What can one do to combat depression? Depression is a common but serious issue that affects many people. Here are some thoughts & tips on the issue. [ Check Out The Topic Of The Week! ]  Emotional factors. When you're sleep deprived and overwhelmed, you may have trouble handling even minor problems. You may be anxious about your ability to care for a newborn. You may feel less attractive or struggle with your sense of identity. You may feel that you've lost control over your life. Any of these factors can contribute to postpartum depression. Lifestyle influences. Many lifestyle factors can lead to postpartum depression, including a demanding baby or older siblings, difficulty breast-feeding, exhaustion, financial problems, and lack of support from your partner or other loved ones. Trauma and stress. Things like financial problems, the breakup of a relationship, or the death of a loved one can bring on depression. You can become depressed after changes in your life, like starting a new job, graduating from school, or getting married. Pessimistic personality. People who have low self-esteem and a negative outlook are at higher risk of becoming depressed. These traits may actually be caused by low-level depression (called dysthymia). Physical conditions. Serious medical conditions like heart disease, cancer, and HIV can contribute to depression, partly because of the physical weakness and stress they bring on. Depression can make medical conditions worse, since it weakens the immune system and can make pain harder to bear. In some cases, depression can be caused by medications used to treat medical conditions.  RELATED WALLPAPERDepressed? Hit The Gym!

Body Transformation: Journey Junkie
Julia was convinced fitness models had elite genes before she walked in their shoes. See how this mother put herself first and started a fitness journey full of twists and turns!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/body-transformation-journey-junkie.html,"Name: Julia Valencia  Email:Valencia.julia@hotmail.comBodySpace:fitfoodjunkie      AGE 29 HEIGHT 5'1"" WEIGHT 174 lbs BODY FAT 34%  AGE 31 HEIGHT 5'1"" WEIGHT 110 lbs BODY FAT 9%  Why I Decided to TransformI've always been the person who tried to help and impress everyone before myself. As a result, I became completely out of shape, down, angry, and embarrassed about how I looked. I became an emotional eater to deal with issues and cope with stress. After having two beautiful children, I suffered from what I believe to be postpartum depression.Before I decided to make this life change, I was hanging onto an on-and-off seven-year relationship. I can look back on it today and realize it was going absolutely nowhere. As the years passed, we learned how to bring each other down more than we learned to love each other.I remember envying cover girls on fitness magazines while waiting in line at the checkout to purchase groceries. I was convinced they were part of some elite genetic community. One day, I decided enough was enough. Like a light switch, I decided to change my life and be healthy. I weighed a whopping 174 pounds and held 34 percent body fat. At 5-foot-1, I was considered obese. Up until that point, I was in denial about my health. That day was September 1, 2010. The beginning to any life-changing journey is never easy. The effort to get started and keep going during the first few weeks was difficult because I battled my own negativity. After a few months of hard work, people started noticing and my failing relationship ended once and for all. Putting myself first, exercising, and watching what I ate gave me time to reflect on areas that went wrong in my life. I discovered how to love myself. Within a year of this lifestyle change, I gained loads of confidence and learned to appreciate the little things.The decision to compete in figure came after eyeballing an event for nearly a year. I knew exactly which organization I wanted to participate in: International Drug-Free Athletics. I told close friends about my goal. Some were supportive and others weren't, but I forged ahead, lost friends, and gained new friends. The training and diet preparation was one of the most difficult yet rewarding journeys to date. Going through with it and reaching the end was an accomplishment I never fathomed I could reach. How I Accomplished My GoalsI embedded a ""no excuses"" mentality into my brain and it showed. I couldn't get to a gym, let alone afford a personal trainer, so I got creative. I started running up and down my staircase at home and performed simple exercises using my own bodyweight after my children went to bed. I watched what I ate and cut out sugary drinks. Within three months, after accomplishing a 3000-stair climb, I lost 21 pounds. I was pumped and continued stair-climbing and bodyweight exercises for two more months.By January 2011, I lost 32 pounds and started getting nervous about gaining the weight backit had happened before. Despite losing weight, I knew something was missing: clean eating and strength training. I was hesitant to pick up the weights and the thought of using protein powder freaked me out, but I put faith in the concept and off I went with nothing to lose. By May 2011, I lost 54 pounds.There were many days I felt like giving up, but I kept my ""no excuse"" attitude. I researched successful females like Tosca Reno, Erin Stern, and Kim Dolan Leto. I followed their stories, their past, and their training and eating habits. It became a daily regimen to spend at least one hour per day reading about successful women in the fitness industry. I searched the Internet like a fitness fiend, soaking up whatever information I could about clean eating and fitness. I watched inspirational YouTube videos about fitness, and overcoming obstacleswhatever I could get my hands related to fitness. Most important to me throughout the process were my children.

The Lowdown On EFA's!
Personally when I first heard that there were types of fats that actually helped your body and helped you lose weight, I did not believe it. After doing a pretty good amount of reading and some research, I found out that the myth was true.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/efa.htm,"Well I think some people, especially bodybuilders, are beginning to realize that not all fat is bad, especially essential fatty acids, yet approximately 80% of Americans lack sufficient amounts of EFA's in their daily diet [7]. Personally when I first heard that there were types of fats that actually helped your body and helped you lose weight, I did not believe it. After doing a pretty good amount of reading and some research, I found out that the myth was true. Here is a bit of what I found out through my research.  Fats In General   The main components of all fats are fatty acids, which consist of being either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids are generally solid at room temperature and are commonly known as saturated fats. They are usually derived from animal sources such as lard, suet, and butter. Most plant fats are high in either polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats except palm and coconut fat, which are highly saturated. Saturated and monounsaturated fats are not necessary in the diet as they can be made in the human body[2].  Essential Fatty Acids   Essential fatty acids (EFA) cannot be made by the body, thus must be supplied through the diet. They are essential for rebuilding and producing new cells.  Two basic categories of EFAs are Omega-3 and Omega-6. Omega-6 EFAs include linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids, which are found in raw nuts, seeds, legumes and sesame and soybean oil[3]. Omega-3 EFA's include alpha-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acid, which found in fresh deepwater fish, fish oil, certain vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oils[3].  These oils must be consumed in pure liquid or supplement form, which must kept away from heat, which destroys essential fatty acids[3]. These essential fatty acids are needed for the production of compounds known as eicosanoids, which help regulate blood-clotting, blood pressure, heart rate, immune response, and a wide variety of other biological processes[10]. Within the body both can be converted to other PUFAs such as arachidonic acid, or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)[3].  What Do They Do?   Transport oxygen from red blood cells to the tissues Promote brain development Keep saturated fats mobile in the blood stream Are an anti-inflammatory (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) Regulate pressure in the eye, joints, and blood vessels, and mediating immune response Regulate bodily secretions and their viscosity Dilate or constricting blood vessels Regulate collateral circulation Reduces blood pressure / Dilates blood vessels Regulate cell division rate Maintain the fluidity and rigidity of cellular membranes Regulate the inflow and outflow of substances to and from cells Direct endocrine hormones to their target cells Maintain proper kidney function and fluid balance Prevent blood cells from clumping together (blood clots that can be a cause of heart attack and stroke) Regulate smooth muscles and autonomic reflexes Regulate nerve transmission and communication Support cardiovascular health  Omega 3 Fatty Acids   Omega-3, also known as and written as n-3 or w-3, is the name given to a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The parent omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is described as essential as, similar to vitamins, because it must be obtained from diet. It is a polyunsaturated that has 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds[4].  Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role as structural membrane lipids, particularly in nerve tissue and the retina and are precursors to eicosanoids that are highly reactive substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes that act locally to influence a wide range of functions in cells and tissues[9]. It is also known as C18:3n3 (meaning 18 carbons, 3 double bonds, first double bond at the n-3 position)[5].     Omega-3 Synthesis  Alpha-linolenic acid ALA (18:3)    Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (20:5)    Docosahexaenoic acid DHA (22:6)   Both omega 3 and omega 6 cannot be inter-converted and both must be present in the diet in a proper balance for good health. The difference between omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids lie in their chemical structure and their roles in the body. Basically, the omega-3s have anti-inflammatory benefits and help prevent heart disease, whereas omega-6s lower blood cholesterol and support the skin. In one study, 8 weeks of omega-3 supplementation (9-10 grams per day) resulted in significant improvements in joint pain and stiffness among arthritis sufferers[8].  LA Deficiency [11]  Eczema-like skin eruptions Loss of hair Liver degeneration Behavioral disturbances Kidney degeneration Excessive sweating accompanied by thirst Drying up of glands Susceptibility to infections Failure of wound healing Sterility in males Miscarriage in females Arthritis-like conditions Heart and circulatory problems Growth retardation  Food Sources For Omega 3 Fatty Acids (Alpha-Linolenic Acid): Flaxseeds (linseeds) Mustard seeds Pumpkin seeds Soya bean Walnut oil Green leafy vegetables Grains  Oils Made From: Linseed (flaxseeds) Rapeseed (canola) Soya beans  Fish is not the only source of omega 3 acids. Flaxseed oil contains twice as much as is found in fish oil.  Omega 6 Fatty Acids   Omega 6 is linoleic acid, which is also known as n-6 or w-6. It is a polyunsaturated fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms and two double bonds. Linoleic acid is considered an ""omega-6"" or ""n-6"" fatty acid because the first of its double bonds occurs at the sixth carbon from the omega end. It is also referred to as C18:2n6, which basically means it has 18 carbons, 2 double bonds, first double bond at n-6 position[4].  As polyunsaturated fatty acids, both the omega-6 and the omega-3 families have more than one double bond in the carbon chain. All fatty acids in the omega-6 family contain their first double bond between the 6th and 7th carbon atoms (CH3) terminal carbon atom and the omega-3 family of fatty acids have their first double bond between the 3rd and 4th carbon atom[5].  Deficiencies in EFAs can lead to reduced growth, a scaly rash called dermatitis, infertility, and lack of ability to fight infection and heal wounds. Lack of omega-6 fatty acids, however, is extremely rare in diets of those living in certain Western countries, particularly the United States. In fact, North American diets tend to have too much omega-6, particularly in relation to omega-3 fatty acids[6]. This imbalance contributes to long-term diseases such as heart disease, cancer, asthma, arthritis, and depression. For optimum health and disease prevention, the balance should consist of one to four times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids[6].  LNA Deficiency [11]  Growth retardation Weakness Impairment of vision and learning ability Motor incoordination Tingling sensations in arms and legs Behavioral changes  Symptoms That Respond Remarkably Well To LNA Supplementation: High triglycerides (fat) in the blood High blood pressure Sticky platelets Tissue inflammation Edema Dry skin Mental deterioration Low metabolic rate Some kinds of immune dysfunction  Good Sources For Omega 6 Fatty Acids (Linoleic Acid): Vegetables Fruits Nuts Grains Seeds  Oils Made From: Safflower Sunflower Corn Soya Evening primrose Pumpkin Wheat germ Why Supplement With Essential Fatty Acids?   If one does not to eat enough EFAs, there is a greater risk of hardening of the arteries, abnormal blood clot formation, coronary heart disease, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure[1]. Essential fatty acids are polyunsaturated fat and super polyunsaturated fat so your body utilizes them as building materials for cell membranes throughout the body. Without them, the body has to use other harder fats such as saturated fat, which produces harder arteries and many other heart problems. Essential fatty acids also produce prostaglandins, which are similar to hormone elements required for energy metabolism, cardiovascular and immune system health[7].  Research Findings    Many studies have been conducted to test the actual benefits of supplementing with essential fatty acids. A recent expert scientific advisory board at the National Institutes of Health highlighted the importance of a balanced intake of omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids in reducing the adverse effects of elevated arachidonic acid, which is a metabolic product of the catabolism of omega 6 fatty acids[8].  Recent studies have shown consumption of linolenic acid and other omega 3 fatty acids to offer protection against heart disease and heart attacks. This effect is thought to be mediated through the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oils contains large amounts of both EPA and DHA and the majority of studies in this area have used various concentrations of fish oil supplements to demonstrate the health benefits of these essential fatty acids. For example, one gram of menhaden oil (a common source) provides about 300 mg of these fatty acids.  EPA is known to induce an antithrombotic (clot-preventing) effect through its inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase, which results in the platelets sticking less to each other similar to the effects of a taking a pain reliever. Fish oil, and its high content of EPA and DHA, may also protect against heart disease through an anti-inflammatory effect by reduced cytokine production and/or increased nitric oxide production in the endothelium [8].  There is also some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil and flaxseed may help improve insulin sensitivity, modulate lipid metabolism, and combat both mild depression and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Although the data is far from clear, it is known that omega-3 fatty acids are concentrated in the brain and children and adults suffering from depression and/or ADHD typically show sub-optimal blood levels of essential fatty acids. In addition, population studies suggest that a high consumption of fish, which rich in omega-3s, may be related to a lower risk of depression, including postpartum depression[9].  How Much Should I Take?   A minimum of 4-5 grams of linoleic acid (but no more than 6-7 grams) and 2-3 grams of linolenic acid are recommended per day. Supplements of linoleic acid (n-6) are typically not needed, whereas linolenic acid (n-3) supplements (4-10g/d) and/or concentrated EPA/DHA supplements (400-1000mg/d) are recommended to support cardiovascular health.  Total DHA/EPA intake should approach about 1 gram per day - evenly split between the two. When using flax as a concentrated source of essential fatty acids, a typical dose is 1-2 tablespoons per day. If you bought a EFA supplement then just follow the instructions on the bottle [11].  Side Effects   No serious adverse side effects should be expected from regular consumption of essential fatty acid supplements, whether from fish oil or other common oil supplements. Due to the tendency of omega 3 fatty acids to reduce platelet aggregation, which means to make them less sticky, so your blood might not clot as fast as usual.  All around essential fatty acids are a good investment, especially to your health.  Get all your EFA Products here SORTED BY TOP SELLERS! References  Adams, P.B., et al.

Pregnancy And Exercise: Is It Safe?
Does remaining physically inactive actually protect the woman and the fetus? Is exercising safe?
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/teen/derek41.htm,"* This article is only meant to inform, not diagnose. The information presented does not replace talking with your doctor. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor about exercising and follow his recommendations.It was previously thought that when a woman becomes pregnant she should stay off her feet and avoid physical activity. This recommendation was instilled to protect the safety of the woman and the fetus. But, does remaining physically inactive actually protect the woman and the fetus? Current research says NO. Inactivity in fact has many negative effects. Negative Aspects of Pregnancy Pregnancy can negatively affect a woman in many ways. This includes: Nausea Fatigue Back pain Low self-esteem/Depression Gestational diabetes Excessive weight gain, which can lead to obesity Reduced energy Insomnia Constipation Shortness of breath SwellingThese negative effects can hurt the woman's health after giving birth as well. But one does not have to experience these pains because there is a way to alleviate and ease them through exercise. Positive Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy Because the choices a woman makes during pregnancy can affect her health for the rest of her life, it is important that she makes wise decisions during that time. Exercising during pregnancy, when adhering to the advice of their doctor, is one of the wisest decisions a woman can make. As mentioned, exercise alleviates many of the negative pains experienced during pregnancy. It has been shown that exercise reduces nausea, fatigue, and back pain while improving energy and self-esteem (Artal, 1999). Because exercise releases endorphins, a hormone which relieves pain, in the brain, it also enhances one's mood. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing concern. ""GDM is the most common complication of pregnancy, affecting about 5% of pregnant women."" (Brown, 2002) Several studies have shown that exercising during pregnancy improves glucose utilization due to increased insulin sensitivity, which normalizes blood sugar levels (Artal, 1999). Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is a dangerous trend. Most women never regain their pre-pregnancy weight. In fact, pregnancy can lead to obesity. Women gain an average of 2.2 pounds a year after giving birth (Pirisi, 2001). As shown in many studies, exercising during pregnancy can reduce excessive weight gain and decrease the risk of developing obesity (Bakoulis, 2001). Exercising can also increase a woman's strength. This will make carrying the baby, once it is born, as well as diaper bags and car seats easier (Bakoulis, 2001). Perhaps the most beneficial benefit of exercising during pregnancy is having an easier labor. By exercising, a woman can increase her strength, endurance, and overall ability to work with her condition, which makes the task of giving birth less strenuous (Artal, 1999). No doubt, every woman would appreciate this. What Type Of Exercise Should NOT Be Done? First, here is what a pregnant woman should avoid: Exercising in hot and/or humid conditions Dehydration Exercising in the supine position (The gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, a main artery, thereby reducing venous return... blood flow to the heart.) Contact sports (Football, boxing, wrestling, etc.) Activities that could result in falling (Running, skiing, mountain biking, etc.) High altitude exertion Scuba diving (Could cause air embolism)Also, the woman should not start an activity, such as running or jogging, if she is not experienced in it. What Type Of Exercise Should Be Done? The American Council of Sports Medicine recommends that everyone should exercise for at least 30 minutes on most, if not all days. This recommendation holds strong for pregnant women as well (Artal, 2003). Type of Exercise Aerobic exercise consisting of continuous, rhythmic movements that use large muscles is highly recommended. Examples of appropriate activities include, walking, cycling (stationary or machine), aerobic dance, rowing, and swimming. Swimming is considered one of the best exercises a pregnant woman can participate in because the water supports her body; therefore there is no impact on the joints. This is extremely important because during pregnancy, a woman's joints are looser because of hormone levels (Salmon, 1993). Weight lifting when done in moderation is also safe. Pregnancy is not a time to try to increase your one repetition maximum on certain lifts or set new personal records. Lifting light weights with moderate repetitions helps maintain flexibility, muscle tone, and minimizes the risk of injury (Artal, 1999). Duration and Intensity of Exercise Session For previously sedentary women, 20 to 30 minutes at a moderate pace is safe. Previously active women, with no medical complications, can continue exercising close to accustomed ways. As mentioned, pregnancy is not a time to up your intensity or strive to beat your personal bests. Research shows that for aerobic exercise, an intensity of 60-70% of ones maximum heart rate or 50-60% of ones maximal oxygen uptake is safe. Studies also show that exercising at 80% of ones maximum heart rate produced no adverse effects, but it is better to play it safe (Artal, 2003). *As with all exercise, remember to properly warm-up and cool down during each session.* Is Exercise Safe for the Fetus The main reason exercise during pregnancy was frowned upon in the past was fear of harming the unborn baby. There is concern that exercise challenges maternal thermoregulation (heat regulation) during pregnancy, but studies have found that humans have compensatory mechanisms that combat this (Brown, 2002). These mechanisms include increased minute ventilation and skin blood flow. These help dissipate heat during exercise. Studies have also found that there is no association between increased maternal temperature and risk of fetus malformation (Brown, 2002). Exercise has also been found to improve uterine blood flow and placental growth. This results in heavier, longer babies (Pirisi, 2001). Conclusion Exercising during pregnancy is safe IF, and I repeat IF, there are no medical complications. In some cases, exercise is not recommended. It is of extreme importance that you talk with your doctor before beginning an exercise program to make sure it is safe for both you and the fetus. Follow the recommendations giving to you by your doctor.

Sleep Yourself Slim: The Impact Of Sleep Loss On Hormones, Appetite, And Weight!
With only 6 hours of sleep, I convince myself to close my eyes, and think about anything relaxing that is not sleep. After 7.7 hours of sleep, I am really ready to start my day. But why all the fuss about sleep? Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sleep_slim.htm,"I hate sleep; I'm always eager to pop out of bed and start. Start anything: writing, making omelets, whatever. Though, sometimes, I wake up on a Saturday, get excited about wakefulness, and realize that it's only 5:30am.  I feel good enough to wake up and get going. But with only 6 hours of sleep, I convince myself to close my eyes, and think about anything relaxing that is not sleep. Then I usually wake up a couple of hours later. After 7.7 hours of sleep, I am really ready to start my day. But why all the fuss about sleep?  It's important!  First, there is conclusive research that constant, inadequate sleep puts you at risk of obesity and diabetes. Specifically, sleep loss messes with:  How your body uses glucose (sugar/carbs) and secretes insulinIncreases appetiteDecreases energy burned during a 24 hour period. 1. Don't Mess With Insulin   Insulin Resistance:  Insulin resistance is a problem that starts to rear its ugly head in the early stages of Type 2 diabetes. Despite the fact that the body (pancreas) is still making and releasing insulin, a person still cannot get rid of the sugar in their blood fast enough.   RELATED PODCAST  Diabetes Podcast.   Welcome to the Awesome Muscles Podcast Series, where you learn about the best training and nutrition scientific breakthroughs, and approaches, directly from your favorite fitness expert, Daniel Gastelu. [ Click here to learn more. ] Download Seminar #3! (16:53; mp3 - 15.4 MB; December 29, 2005)  This lingering sugar is very harmful to blood vessels, nerves, and eyes; it's also bad for the kidneys, since extra sugar is eliminated through the urine. As a result, your body has to make more and more insulin to get the glucose (sugar) out of your blood and into fat (usually) or muscle cells. Eventually, your pancreas says  ""Screw it, I work hard to clean up the blood and my insulin doesn't work anymore.""  In the advanced stages of diabetes, when your pancreas gives up, you have to start injecting insulin to use clean up carbs.  Listen up college students, shift-workers, and parents of small children, MANY studies show that a couple days of less than 4 hours of sleep per night causes insulin resistance1.  Related Insulin Articles:  Insulin & Supplements: What You Need To Know! - By Christopher MohrInsulin & Bodybuilding. - By ISSAManipulating Your Hormones. - By Intensity MagazineOther Insulin Articles... In essence, your body starts acting more like a diabetic's body, and your pancreas has to work too hard. As a result, many researchers think that chronic loss of sleep may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (which are both also linked to obesity and overweight).   What Is The Metabolic Syndrome? Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It affects a large number of people, and prevalence increases with age. Some studies estimate the prevalence in the USA to be up to 25% of the population.       [ wikipedia.org ]   Increased Desire To Eat High Carbohydrate Foods:  In conjunction with insulin resistance, sleep loss also induces cravings for high-carbohydrate foods 1,2. As such, the problem detailed above is made worse because the pancreas has to secrete even more insulin to take care the gummy bear binge.  Click To Enlarge.The Pancreas Has To Secrete EvenMore Insulin To Take Care Of Your Binging.  Increased Cortisol:  Sleep deprivation also increases the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with obesity, high blood sugar, and lowered immunity (disease-fighting ability). Furthermore, cortisol acts as a stimulus to BREAK DOWN MUSCLE, in order to raise the blood sugar.  The result of 2-3 restless nights is:  Greater intake of high-carb foodsIncreased cortisol levels, which results in muscle destructionA large spike in insulin to cope with excess blood sugar and insulin resistance. These hormonal imbalances, when you are feeling lethargic and shaky, can lead to significant weight gain.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  The Implications Of Cortisol Release!   Cortisol is termed catabolic as it has the opposite effect to testosterone, insulin and growth hormone in that it breaks down tissue.   Author: David Robson  2. I Can't Eat Enough  Cortisol and insulin aren't the only hormones affected by poor sleep. A number of hormones that directly influence appetite are also manipulated.   Lower Leptin:  Scientists used to think that fat was an inert place to store extra energy. Now researchers recognize fat tissue as a powerful hormone-releasing organ that influences diet and activity behaviors. Leptin is a hormone secreted from the fat tissue itself. The more fat you have (extra energy in your body) the more leptin is secreted, generally. Leptin is a hormone that tells your body:  ""You're too fat, stop eating and burn more energy (Calories).""  As a result, appetite diminishes and the body naturally burns more calories, mostly through non-exercise activities1,2.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Hungry, Hungry Hormones !   While you may not be hungry first thing in the morning, forcing yourself to eat or drink something is one of the most beneficial things you can do...   Author: John Berardi  But if a person doesn't get enough sleep, leptin levels decrease. Low leptin levels tell the body that energy levels are low. As a result, appetite increases!   Increased Ghrelin:  It is easy to think of ghrelin as a hormone that is exactly the opposite of leptin. Increased ghrelin tells your body:  ""You are not getting enough energy; eat more and move less!""  As a result, you eat more and move less! As little as 2-3 days of sleep deprivation (4 hours per night) is sever enough to significantly increase the ghrelin in your blood. Combined, the ghrelin and leptin changes after a couple of days of crappy sleep is enough to make you overeat, no question. Research strongly supports this conclusion1,2,3!  Click To Enlarge.2-3 Days Of Sleep Deprivation Is EnoughTo Make You Overeat, No Question.  Increased Time To Eat:  Let's say you're the kind of person who likes to eat every 2-3 hours. And let's also assume you're sleep deprived. Your body is giving you signals that you don't have enough energy and you are craving high-carb junk food.  A sleep loss of 3-4 hours would translate into at least one extra meal of poor-quality food, combined with little motivation to move and burn off the extra calories. In addition, both population and lab-based studies3 show that people actually eat more, on average, the less they sleep!

Don't Ask Me To Move. I'm Tired!   Low Leptin; Decreased Energy Expenditure:  Low leptin and high ghrelin levels are shown to reduce Non-Exercise-Activity-Thermogenesis. (NEAT) HUH? Well, NEAT is basically any movement you do that is not planned exercise. Most of the daily Calorie-burn is used to keep the body tickin'; NEAT is second and exercise is third.  So if NEAT activities subside significantly, the result can be more detrimental than skipping the gym! For instance, when you are tired at 3:00pm, do you feel like playing with your little niece or getting up to go talk to a co-worker? It's unlikely, and you've just given up some NEAT calorie-burn!   Lower Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH):  TSH is the hormone that stimulates, well, your thyroid, which then releases the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. These hormones are STRONGLY related to your metabolism. Sleep deprivation causes a lowering of TSH. In short, the thyroid gland will not be stimulated as much; T3 and T4 will not be fully made/released. Do not pass go; do not drop 20 lbs! Capisci?

If you wake up too early, this ghrelin drop will not happen and you may wake up hungrier than you should be, in addition to all the other obesigenic fun already described.  Furthermore, REM (dream) sleep is greater during the second half of the night. REM sleep is very important for a number of other reasons (long-term memory, etc), but you also burn more calories during REM that during the deeper sleep that predominated the earlier sleep cycles. So pass the 800 TC sheets and silence the cell phone!   Sleep Cycles: REM & NREM: Criteria for REM sleep include not only rapid eye movements, but also a rapid, low voltage EEG and, in mammals at least, low muscle tone. Most memorable dreaming occurs in this stage. NREM accounts for 75??""80% of total sleep time in normal human adults. In NREM sleep, there is relatively little dreaming. Non-REM encompasses four stages; stages 1 and 2 are considered 'light sleep', and 3 and 4 'deep sleep' or slow-wave sleep, SWS.      [ wikipedia.org ]   Obesity Sleep Apnea:  Sleep apnea is a chronic sleep-disturbing condition where an afflicted person actually stops breathing repeatedly throughout the night. This condition is highly detrimental for a variety of reasons and really screws with all the hormones mentioned above.   RELATED POLL Do You Know Someone With Sleep Apnea?  Yes. www.sleepapnea.org No.     Obesity very strongly correlates with sleep apnea, which results in a positive feedback loop in the person with sleep apnea.

Personal Trainers Of The Month: The Educators
Meet three personal trainers who are committed to teaching the ins and outs of fitness to anyone in need, from kids to physique athletes to other trainers!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/personal-trainers-of-the-month-the-educators.html,"You may not immediately think of personal trainers as educators. That term is only for school teachers and professors, right? Well, Nick Clayton, Brandi Binkley, and Sergio Maldonado are changing that.  Their training styles, locations, and certifications are different, but their goals are the same. They want to leave this industry strongerand smarterthan when they found it! Trainer Of Trainers Nick ClaytonVital Stats Name: Nick Clayton Age: 36 Training Experience: 12 years Education/Certification: B.S. in fitness management and corporate health promotion; MS in exercise physiology; MBA; NSCA-CPT; NSCA-CSCS*D, NSCA-RSCC, USAW Location: Colorado Springs Contact Info: nick.clayton@nsc... Duties: Deliver presentations and sessions to develop personal trainers Athletic Background: Soccer, off-road triathlon Training Specialty: Injury prevention, mobility, metabolic conditioning  How do personal trainers learn how to train clients? They study under master trainers like Nick Clayton. As a manager at the National Strength and Conditioning Association in Colorado, Clayton helps prepare trainers for the gym floor.  He began his journey doing personal training for some extra cash in college, but quickly developed a love for the teaching aspects of the business. At his first gym in Gainesville, new PTs were put on a team with a master level trainer who was responsible with helping them develop.  The experience gave Clayton a lasting passion for practical training. While he grants that it's important for trainers to learn from colleges and universities, he's insistent that the central part of becoming a trainer is working with actual clients.  ""Most of the courses don't have a lot of hands-on training, like squat variations. That comes with experience,"" Clayton says. ""The degree helps you understand the fundamentals that go into training, but that's where a lot of people get stuck. They get their master's degree and assume they have all the knowledge they need. But they don't have practical experience. That only comes with working with hundreds of clients who all move differently and have different goals and athletic levels.""  Whose body should you start with? Yours! Clayton suggests that new PTs get involved and demonstrate their knowledge with their own bodies first. ""If you tell someone they have to squat to be strong, they want to see if you can squat. It's not about showing off or showing them up, but you have to be able to demonstrate it and know what they are going through, that you can do it yourself. You have to be a role model.""   ""That's where a lot of people get stuck. They get their master's degree and assume they have all the knowledge they need. But they don't have practical experience. That only comes with working with hundreds of clients who all move differently and have different goals and athletic levels."" Extra Points What are 3 things new trainers need to do before they put a client on the gym floor? Practice what you preach. Never ask a client to do something you have not at least tried yourself.Understand that every client is unique. This applies to their physical abilities, levels of self-confidence and self-efficacy, and learning style, just to name a few.Recognize that what you say and how you say it is just as important as the program you develop.Master Motivator Brandi BinkleyVital Stats Name: Brandi Binkley Age: 35 Training Experience: 13 years Education/Certification: M.S. in exercise physiology, NSCA-CPT Location: Nashville, TN Website: www.getphysiofit.com Contact Info: physiofitnashvil... Number of Clients: Personal, 45; Studio, 220 Rates: $45-95 Athletic Background: National-level figure competitor Training Specialties: Strength training, competition coaching, general fitness and quality of life.  Brandi Binkley grew up a natural athlete, and she scratched her itch with activities like cheerleading and dance team. Then, one day, she found herself bored. The same old routines weren't going to cut it anymore. What was a girl to do? She enrolled in the Navy, where she worked as a rescue swimmer.  Of course, this job wasn't without its risks. One day, Binkley injured her knee jumping from a helicopter, after which she switched to work with an F-18 squadron. When she left the military, depressed from weight gain after her injury, she began training. Encouraged by what she was capable of doing in the gym, she got a degree in exercise physiology and began eying a career as a personal trainer.  Through training, Binkley found a professional outlet that combined her dual passions of physical activity and military discipline. ""I expect a lot from clients. To show up, do what I ask, be present. I learned that on active duty,"" she says. ""It takes time, diligence to get things done.""  She opened her own facility in Nashville and was surprised by her success. ""The economy was ripe for what we do,"" she recalls. In less than two years, she had expanded her 1,800-square-foot facility to over 8,000 square feet, and she had to hire six trainers, a nutritionist, a prenatal/postpartum expert, and even an MD to fill it.  ""Collaboration is key, and we do that a lot in the training business,"" Binkley says. ""I collaborate with people who are better at what they do than I am. There are better nutritionists, people better at fixing injuries. We care about the people who are coming in. It's not about me, it's about them, and they see it and sense it.""   ""We care about the people who are coming in. It's not about me, it's about them, and they see it and sense it.""  So among all these experts, what is Binkley's specialty? ""It's my job not to just know exercise physiology, but to know each person and be able to look at them and tell them what they need,"" she says. ""I'm best at motivating and getting people to love exercise, creating fun programs that help them enjoy it.""  But don't take ""fun"" to mean ""light."" This former high-level figure competitor believes that there's no replacement for the big lifts. ""Everything we do is based on strength and conditioning, whether they are 70 or 17,"" she says. ""Don't forget old-school weightlifting: squat, bench, and deadlift. Trends don't cater to people who want to get onstage. People look better onstage when they have nice hard-earned dense muscle tissue. They diet down and look better than everyone else.""

Along the way, he has also bounced happily between fitness methods, including Pilates, Olympic lifting, yoga, powerlifting, and kettlebell training.  That resume may scream ""trainer,"" but Maldonado says it took him a while to see the writing on the wall. ""It was an accident!"" he says. ""After finding a part-time job at the YMCA, I thought working up to a personal trainer looked like fun. It wasand more!""  Eight years later, Maldonado is as open-minded a personal trainer as you'll find. He has to be in order to work with his two most prominent audiences: youth groups, and people of all ages who want to lose weight.  ""I can both learn and practice from so many fields, such as nutrition, training, psychology, rehabilitation, performance, and interpersonal skills,"" he says. ""Being able to constantly work on supplying help to my clients and athletes gives me so much purpose in my work.""  When it comes to working with youth, that purpose is clear. ""I think it's so important to establish a love for health and movement.""  Along the way, he has become certified as both a kettlebell instructor and a performance nutrition specialist, but Maldonado hasn't let his certifications define him. ""I'm not married to any one method, but the one that will work for you, which is why I equip myself with so many tools to help,"" he says. ""I feel that mindset, movement, recovery, and nutrition are the four key factors clients need to succeed. I work on improving them all.""   ""Being able to constantly work on supplying help to my clients and athletes gives me so much purpose in my work.""

If At First...
Being the competitive person that I am, I of course wanted to do well, but I wasn't expecting anything great. When I first entered the auditorium for the contestant meeting, I felt kind of lost.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simone2.htm,"October 2001: I entered my very first fitness competition after being recruited over 2&frac12; years earlier. Did I think I was prepared? No. Was I nervous? Well, not really...  I entered my first competition with the understanding that I was a newcomer and, quite frankly, I didn't have a clue what I was getting myself into. Being the competitive person that I am, I of course wanted to do well, but I wasn't expecting anything great.When I first entered the auditorium for the contestant meeting, I felt kind of lost.This meeting was so different from my sports team meetings that I had grown used to from my years in high school and college. Where were my teammates? Where was my coach? I was alone, but I was proud.Proud that I had made the commitment to compete at a different level, proud that I was fulfilling one of my goals. As the meeting continued, the head judge described how the swimsuit round would be conducted.All of the contestants were to walk out on stage for group comparisons, and then each contestant would need to take a turn posing for the judges individually. Morning Session I had seen this part of the competition on ESPN, so I kind of knew what I was supposed to be doing. When it came to the group comparisons, however, I had no idea how I was supposed to be posing. I actually had to look around while we were being judged to see what other girls were doing. The fitness routine was next. I felt most confident about this segment of the competition, as I had competed in gymnastics as a youth. As the competition continued, however, I grew slightly nervous that the stage would be slippery from the previous competition. The oil from the bodybuilders coated the surface of the stage and in some spots there were even small puddles. Although the crew members did their best to clean the stage, some residue was still present.I just prayed that I wouldn't hurt myself and tried to be optimistic. It was finally my turn, and I was as pumped up as the first time I set foot in the starting blocks for the 100 meter dash. My adrenaline was rushing a little too much as my nerves began to make me numb.As I set foot onto the stage, my music began without me. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I realized that I was not allowed to start over, but it wasn't my fault. I had told the director that I needed my music to start after I got on stage. They tried again. RELATED ARTICLE  My Journey Back To The Stage - Postpartum! The journey back was much harder than I could have ever imagined. I was prepared for the physical agony, but the emotional side... Read on to see how I made it back. [ Click here to learn more. ] When I was in place, my music started in the same place that it had ended minutes before. I thought to myself, there is no way this can be happening to me. All my time and efforts seemed wasted. I was livid at this point in time, which for me was good, because when I get mad, I get even.Actually, it calmed my nerves to the point that I felt like I needed to go out there and prove to everyone that I was good and deserved a chance. I had to wait until the next competitor took the stage before I could perform. I thought my chances were over, but I wanted to perform anyway. I had come so far and worked so hard that I wanted someone to see what I could do. As I took the stage for the third time there was announcement made that no points would be deducted due to technical difficulties with the music.I was unaware of this announcement prior to the competition, however, so I went on competing in a rage in hopes that I could make up for the music problems.I completed my routine relieved that the morning session was over. Night Session The night session was only for tie brakes and an audience show. I went out and performed with everything I had; however, the stage was more slippery than the morning session. My hand slipped on my round-off and I could not perform one of my skills as I was sitting in a puddle of oil. I figured it was all over. I had failed and there was no turning back. I would just use this experience as a lesson learned. When the top 5 contestants were called that night, I was not among them. I was not surprised, but again, being the competitive person that I am, I was very disappointed.After the competition was over, I took some extra time to meet with a few judges to find out what things I could improve upon for the next competition. I learned that my three-inch heels did not give me the length in my legs that a six-inch heel would, that my halter bikini top looked too much like a shirt top, my skirt for my routine was too long, and my shoes were too flashy.I also learned that my muscle definition was washed out under the stage lights and this could be fixed by applying professional tanning dyes. Other than that, I was told that my routine needed to flow together a little better, as my movements did not have smooth transitions. After hearing so many things that I could improve upon, I was excited once again. RELATED ARTICLE  Should I Get On The Fitness Stage? So many people have the desire to compete, but fear losing or not looking their best. If you want to compete, you should! I encourage participation in competition when the desire is there. [ Click here to learn more. ] Much to my surprise, about a week after the competition, I received a telephone call stating that I had placed in the top 10 (I later found out that I placed 7th out of 16 ladies) and qualified for Nationals! I was so excited, but I didn't know how I was going to make so many changes in a month's time.Needless to say, I made as many changes as I could in a short amount of time, but I was not totally prepared for the Fitness America Pageant Finals. I ended up placing 44th out of 96 competitors. I was happy with my results, as my goal was to place in the top half. I had the opportunity to meet many wonderful athletes, and I learned so much more about what it takes to be one of the best. This past April, I entered my third fitness competition in Pennsylvania. I walked away with a 2nd place trophy, which qualified me for this year's Fitness America Pageant-ESPN Finals.Although I was confident in my performance and I received the audiences support, I feel as though the couple of tenths that separated me from winning is a sign that my work is not done. Conclusion One of my favorite quotes comes from ""The Butterfly"" (author unknown), ""Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If God allowed us to go through our lives without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. We could never fly!""So, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again - for one day all the hard work will allow you to soar to the top!Good Luck, and God Bless!"

Bodybuilding & The Endocrine System!
The remainder of this article will explain exactly how the endocrine system functions, and how exercise can positively effect this functioning. Key hormones, and respective endocrine glands, that are both affected by exercise and responsible...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson28.htm,"Many health benefits are to be gained through bodybuilding. In fact, bodybuilding's training regimes and dietary practices can enhance cardiovascular, mental and immune health and improve weight loss. One aspect of health that is not often touched on, when bodybuilding's benefits are discussed, is the endocrine (or hormonal) system.  The endocrine system (from the Greek terms ""endo"" meaning within and ""krine"" meaning to separate or secrete) is comprised of chemical substances called hormones which serve as messengers, passing information from endocrine gland to organ, to control a large number of physiologic functions. To ensure these functions are governed efficiently, effective hormonal control is of paramount importance.  Exercise is one of the best ways to beneficially assist the release and reception of hormones. Studies have shown that exercise actually increases the amount of circulating hormones in our bodies as well as strengthening the receptor sites on their target organ cells.  The remainder of this article will explain exactly how the endocrine system functions, and how exercise can positively effect this functioning. Key hormones, and respective endocrine glands, that are both affected by exercise and responsible for bodybuilding success will be discussed.  The Endocrine System   The endocrine systems glands manufacture and secrete hormones, which communicate with specific organs and, in concert with the nervous and immune systems, enable vital functions to occur within our bodies. The endocrine glands are ductless, which means they secrete the hormones they manufacture directly into the bloodstream to be taken to the appropriate target organ, upon which these hormones act.  Specific cells on the target organ which act as binding sites (hormone receptors) recognize the shape of each hormone and allow it to enter (a lock and key mechanism).  Hormones bring their characteristic effects on target cells by modifying cellular activity, and given that they are very potent substances, hormones need to be tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis.  Many hormones are controlled through what is termed a negative feedback mechanism, which causes a reversal of increases or decreases in the concentration of a particular hormone, to maintain homeostasis. This negative feedback mechanism illustrates just how sensitive a target organ is to the hormone it receives.  The Major Endocrine Glands Are:  The thyroid Parathyroid Adrenal Pituitary Pineal gland Pancreas Testes Ovaries  Organs that are hormonally active as part of their function, but are not endocrine glands per se, are:Thymus Stomach Heart Small-intestine Placenta Although the endocrine glands are scattered throughout the body, and serve different functions, they are considered a system because they have similar mechanisms of influence and functions, and many important relationships.  The Three General Classes Of Hormones Classified By Their Protein or Steroid Chemical Structure Are: Amino Acid Derivatives: as the name suggests these are derived from amino acids; tyrosine in particular. Epinephrine for example is an amino acid derived hormone.  Steroid Hormones: these include prostaglandins and all are lipids, made from cholesterol.  Peptide Hormones: the biggest group of hormones, peptides are short chains of amino acids. Insulin for example is a peptide hormone.  * It is interesting to note that, in fact, all of the hormones in our body are derivatives of proteins or proteins themselves, except for the those in the adrenal cortex and the sex hormones, which are steroid hormones. Steroid hormones typically react with receptor sites inside a cell because the process is slower as protein synthesis is required, whereas protein hormones react with receptors on the surface of a cell in a more rapid fashion.   Key hormones beneficially affected by exercise are: Testosterone Growth hormone Estrogen Thyroxine Epinephrine Insulin Endorphins Glucagon Testosterone   Both males and females produce testosterone, which is a key bodybuilding hormone, as it increases basal metabolic rate, decreases body fat, increases feelings of self-confidence, and maintains muscle volume, tone and strength. In fact, testosterone, along with growth hormone, is responsible for the hypertrophy (increased size and density) of muscle cells as well as the repair of micro-tears in the muscle tissue.   Females have only about one tenth of the testosterone males have, but even at that level, powerful effects are exerted: libido and strength of orgasm for example. The process underlying testosterones release is rather complex.  Firstly, the hypothalamus (situated in the brain), releases gonadotrophin releasing hormone to the anterior pituitary gland, which, in turn, releases luteinizing hormone, which travels to the Leydig cells of the testes and stimulates the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to Testosterone.  Ancient Greek texts prescribed the ingestion of  bull testicles to treat loss of energy! The key to boosting testosterone levels through exercise is to concentrate on the larger muscle groups while avoiding training the same body-part two days in a row.  It has also been shown that a higher level of training intensity can be achieved in the morning as it is then that testosterone levels are at their highest. Consequently, greater gains could theoretically be made at this time.  Repetitions should be kept low, while a correspondingly heavy weight is lifted, if testosterone boosting is ones aim. 85% of ones one-repetition-maximum for 1-2 reps is best.  In essence, the best form of training for testosterone increase is short, intense, anaerobic session. With aerobic training, shorter, 45-minute sessions are ideal as testosterone is depressed is this period is exceeded.  Learn more about testosterone, click here.  Growth Hormone   Growth hormone which is released from the brains pituitary gland is an important bodybuilding hormone. It stimulates protein synthesis, and helps to strengthen bones, ligaments, tendons and cartilage. It also plays a role in fat mobilization, and the corresponding decrease in carbohydrate usage, during exercise.   As a result, body fat is used and blood glucose levels are balanced which allows one to train over a longer period of time (without exceeding the testosterone maximizing 45-minute period of course).  Increases in growth hormone provide a multitude of immediate benefits which include, increased energy, ability to concentrate, and interest and ability in sex (Kennedy, 2004). Longer-term benefits include, increased aerobic capacity and strength, thickening of hair, tightening of wrinkles and loose skin, decrease in visceral fat, and strengthening of osteoporotic bones (Kennedy, 2004).  Growth hormone production is reduced significantly as we age and can be prescribed to offset the negative effects of aging. However, without going to extremes, one can increase their output of growth hormone in the most effective natural way possible: though exercise.  For increased growth hormone the most productive form of exercise is vigorous, sustained anaerobic training. Adopt the same strategy as when training for testosterone release and, target the large muscle groups, the quads in particular. Train no longer than 30 minutes when specifically aiming to increase growth hormone.  This applies to aerobic training also, which should be undertaken at a very high intensity; bordering on anaerobic. Interval training is the ideal.  Learn more about growth hormone, click here.  Estrogen   The beneficial effects of estrogen, in its most biologically active form, 17 beta estradiol, include, fat mobilisation for fuel, mood elevation, increased basal metabolic rate, and libido in women primarily. As a woman ages her estrogen levels vary to regulate the reproductive system and are reduced significantly by the time she reaches menopause.    bmr_calculator();    A study by Copeland, Consitt and Tremblay, reported that blood levels of estrogen, were significantly higher in women aged 19-69 years old after 40 minutes of either endurance or resistance exercise versus a control group who performed no exercise. Furthermore, blood levels of estrogen remain elevated for up to four-hours following an exercise session.  Learn more about estrogen, click here.  Thyroxine    This hormone is produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland and its main role is to raise the body's metabolic rate. It is therefore a key hormone for weight-loss, as more calories are expended through its release. Thyroxine has an additional effect of influencing physical development.   Thyroxine increases in the blood by about 30% during exercise and remains elevated for up to five hours afterward. The intensity should be kept high to realise maximum benefit. Thyroxine levels at rest are also increased through exercise.  Epinephrine    Produced in the adrenal medulla, epinephrine, a neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system, increases the amount of blood the heart pumps and directs the blood to where it is needed - the extremities. Epinephrine is one of the catecholamines, the other being norepinephrine, and both are synthesised from the amino acid  tyrosine.   Epinephrine also stimulates the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and muscles and stored fat to be used as fuel. Vasodilation in muscle and liver vasculatures results also from increased epinephrine release. This allows the muscle to receive more oxygenated blood, increasing our ability to use these muscles while exercising.  To increase epinephrine exercise sessions, once again, need to be very intense. The amount of epinephrine released from the medulla is proportional to exercise intensity. Insulin    Insulin, produced in the islet cells of the pancreas, is an important hormone which decreases (regulates) blood levels of glucose and directs amino acids and fatty acids into cells.   Most of our body's cells have insulin receptors, which are composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits linked by disulfide bonds, and bind the circulating insulin. The cell then can activate other receptors which are designed to absorb glucose (sugar) from the blood stream into the cell.   Examples Of Insulin  Name of Insulin Start Activity Highest ActivityEnds Activity Low BSVery short-acting (Humalog) 10 minutes 1.5 hours 3 hours 2-4 hours Short-acting (Regular/-R) 20 minutes 3-4 hours 8 hours 3-7 hoursIntermediate acting (Nor L) 1.5-2 hours 4-15 hours 22-24 hours 6-13 hoursLong-acting (Ultra Lente) 4 hours 10-24 hours 36 hours 12-28 hoursCombination: 70% N/30% R 0-1 hour 3-13 hours 12-20 hours 3-12 hoursCombination: 50% N/50% R 0-1 hour 3-12 hours 12-20 hours 3-12 hoursHumalog was administered about 15 minutes before an appropriate meal Regular Type-R was administered 30 minutes before an appropriate meal Low BS = Low blood sugar (Glucose). Note: This is an excert from an Author L. Rea article.    An insulin response ensues after a meal has been consumed. An excessive insulin response causes fat to accumulate within cells, and, over time, those who frequently experience such responses can become overweight and their cells may develop a resistance to insulin (diabetes).  Weight loss through daily aerobic and weight-training can help to rectify this situation, depending on the type of diabetes they have. One may be fortunate to escape diabetes, but they will likely become overweight with continual, excessive insulin responses.  Therefore, it is important to exercise to help offset any potential blood sugar problems. Blood-insulin levels begin to decrease within ten minutes of aerobic training and continue to decrease as the session progresses. Weight training has been shown to increase the cells sensitivity (receptivity) to insulin at rest.  Learn more about insulin, click here.  Endorphins    Released from the pituitary gland, the endorphins are an endogenous opioid class of chemicals produced under conditions of pain, which block this pain, decrease appetite, create a feeling of euphoria and reduce tension and anxiety. Biochemically, endorphins are polypeptide neurotransmitters, containing 30 amino acid units.   Exercising is particularly beneficial in terms of endorphin release. In fact blood levels of endorphins increase above resiting levels up to five times with longer duration (over 30 minutes) aerobic exercise at moderate to intense levels. An increased sensitivity to endorphins is developed after several months of regular exercise.  This means that a higher high will arise from the same training stimulus. Although longer duration exercise is suggested as a rule, it is rather arbitrary, as individual variability dictates how one will experience the effect of endorphins.  Glucagon     As with insulin, glucagon, a linear peptide of 29 amino acids, is secreted by the pancreas. Its main role, in contradiction to insulin however, is to increase blood glucose levels. Glucagon is synthesized as proglucagon and proteolytically (the hydrolysis of proteins into simpler compounds through the actions of enzymes) processed to yield glucagon within alpha cells of the pancreatic islets.   Glucagon exerts its physiologic effects in two ways: It is secreted when blood sugar falls too low, and this causes carbohydrate in the liver to be released into the blood stream, which raises blood sugar levels to normal.  It activates hepatic gluconeogenesis. This process involves the conversion of amino acids into glucose to be used as energy.  Researchers Bonjorn, Latour, Belanger and Lavoie, from Montreal University, found that exercise enhanced the livers sensitivity to glucagon. This demonstrates the effect exercise, and its facilitation of glucagon, has on nutritional conversion for energy purposes. Glucagon is typically secreted about 30 minutes into an exercise session, at the onset of blood glucose reduction. Conclusion   As demonstrated in this article, hormones, and their multifarious complex interactions, underpin many of our most important biological functions. These fascinating molecules go about their job in relative obscurity, while we conduct out daily affairs, completely dependant on their respective roles.  Indeed, the efficient functioning of our endocrine system is very important, and through exercising diligently we can play a role in its upkeep.  References  Bloom, W.(2001). The Endorphin Effect.

Both words, caffeine and coffee, are derived from the Arabic word qahweh (pronounced ""kahveh"" in Turkish). Coffee trees were cultivated in the 6th century and coffee itself began to be popular in Europe in the 17th century. By the 18th century plantations had been established in Indonesia and the West Indies. The Modern WorldIt's hardly a coincidence that coffee and tea caught on in Europe just as the first factories were ushering in the industrial revolution. The widespread use of caffeinated drinks - replacing the ever popular beer - facilitated the great transformation of human economic endeavor from the farm to the factory.Boiling water to make coffee or tea helped decrease the incidence of disease among workers in crowded cities. And the caffeine in their systems kept them from falling asleep over the machinery. In a sense, caffeine is the drug that made the modern world possible. And the more modern our world gets, the more we seem to need it.  Caffeine & Sleep: Without that useful jolt of coffee - or Diet Coke or Red Bull - to get us out of bed and back to work, the 24-hour society of the developed world couldn't exist.""For most of human existence, your pattern of sleeping and wakefulness was basically a matter of the sun and the season,"" explains Charles Czeisler, a neuroscientist and sleep expert at Harvard Medical School. ""When the nature of work changed from a schedule built around the sun to an indoor job timed by a clock, humans had to adapt. The widespread use of caffeinated food and drink-in combination with the invention of electric light-allowed people to cope with a work schedule set by the clock, not by daylight or the natural sleep cycle.""Scientists have developed various theories to explain caffeine's ""wake-promoting"" power. The consensus today focuses on the drug's interference with adenosine, a chemical in the body that acts as a natural sleeping pill.  RELATED ARTICLE Chemically Correct: CaffeineDespite how caffeine affects my individual biochemistry, I find its widespread use fascinating. Here are my discoveries of a drug that is socially accepted by all ages. [ Click here to learn more. ] Caffeine blocks the hypnotic effect of adenosine and keeps us from falling asleep. Since caffeine has also been shown to enhance mood and increase alertness in moderate amounts, it's a potent potion for students and scholars stuck in the lab at three in the morning.  Caffeine & Workouts: Caffeine is used by fitness enthusiasts to get more out of their workouts. Once thought of as a 'health no-no' for athletes, caffeine is taking center stage as a legitimate aid to performance. This benefit has been recognized by the makers of sports nutrition products like energy gels (see chart below).A growing body of laboratory research supports caffeine as an effective ergogenic aid (An ergogenic aid is a substance that improves athletic performance). The most dramatic performance improvements (20-50 percent) are seen during prolonged (over two-hours) endurance exercise. To View Top Selling Caffeine Products Click Here.  Sleep Murderer: Caffeine is also reported to benefit short-term intense exercise lasting about five minutes at maximal output. Caffeine's ability to murder sleep also makes it a drug of choice for long-distance travelers. There are as many different jet-lag remedies as there are seats on a trans-Pacific flight.But one approach, outlined in The Caffeine Advantage by Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer, involves abstaining from caffeine for several days before traveling, then dosing yourself with small amounts of coffee or tea on the day you arrive to stay alert-preferably out in the sunshine-until your regular bedtime in your destination.""Caffeine helps people try to wrest control away from the human circadian rhythm that is hardwired in all of us,"" says Czeisler. But then a shadow crosses the doctor's sunny face and his tone changes sharply. ""On the other hand,"" he says solemnly, ""there is a heavy, heavy price that has been paid for all this extra wakefulness.""CAFFEINE INTAKE CALCULATOR        To find out your average daily caffeine intake        41 (in milligrams), fill in how many servings you consume per day for each of these items:        Unfortunately, this calculator won&apos;t run without JavaScript. We&apos;re sorry for the inconvenience. Without adequate sleep - the conventional eight hours out of each 24 is about right - the human body will not function at its best, physically, mentally, or emotionally, the doctor says. ""As a society, we are tremendously sleep deprived.""In fact, the professor goes on; there is a sort of catch-22 at the heart of the modern craving for caffeine. ""The principal reason that caffeine is used around the world is to promote wakefulness,"" Czeisler says. ""But the principal reason that people need that crutch is inadequate sleep.""""Think about that: We use caffeine to make up for a sleep deficit that is largely the result of using caffeine.""Caffeine Effects During PregnancyIf consuming caffeine in general is something many people shouldn't do, then what about women who are pregnant? Safety of caffeine consumption during pregnancy is controversial. Some studies suggest that small amounts of caffeine (less than two average cups) of coffee per day presents a slight risk to the embryo or fetus, while others do not.There is stronger evidence that larger daily amounts of caffeine during pregnancy may increase the risks of miscarriage, preterm delivery and low birth weight, but no solid proof.High caffeine intake during pregnancy should be avoided. A pregnant woman may be able to tolerate more than her fetus can. Related Articles: So You're Pregnant: Now What?Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide!Working Out With Children.Other Pregnancy Articles...Risks of even small amounts of caffeine consumption are not clear. Women trying to become pregnant may conceive sooner if they limit caffeine intake to less then two cups daily. Breastfeeding women can minimize infants' exposures to caffeine by avoiding a very high caffeine intake. Caffeine's Effects On Women's Fertility:Some studies have found a link between high levels of caffeine consumption by women and delayed conception. Women who consumed more than 300 mg of caffeine per day were twice as likely to have conception delayed for a year or more.1 Another study also linked high caffeine intake to delayed conception, but only in women consuming 500 mg or more (about four cups of coffee) per day.2Best to keep your caffeine intake below 300 mg a day. Caffeine's Effects On The Developing Fetus:Caffeine easily passes from mother to fetus through the placenta. A developing fetus may have higher, sustained blood levels of caffeine than its mother because of immature metabolism.3 A few studies have shown that consuming even small amounts of caffeine can affects fetal heart rate and movement patterns.3 A pregnant woman's ability to metabolize caffeine slows as pregnancy progresses, so some of its effects may increase later in pregnancy.Some studies have found that pregnant women who consumed large quantities of caffeine (five or more cups of coffee a day) were twice as likely to miscarry as those who consumed less, while fewer or no effects were seen at lower levels of caffeine consumption.4, 5 A detailed analysis of caffeine's reported effects on pregnancy outcome can be found at motherisk.org. Excerpt From MothersRisk.org[ Q ] Many of my female patients, those who plan pregnancy or have conceived, are afraid of any intake of caffeine. This often makes their lives miserable during pregnancy. Is this justified scientifically?           [ A ] Motherisk's recent meta-analysis suggests that the risks for miscarriage and fetal growth retardation increase only with daily doses of caffeine above 150 mg/d, equivalent to 1.5 cups (250mL/cup) of coffee a day. It is possible that some of this presumed risk is due to confounders, such as cigarette smoking.  Caffeine's Affects On Newborns & Infants: High caffeine consumption during pregnancy may shorten gestation and lower birth weight.6 Both effects appear modest in terms of days and ounces, but may be important to an infant already compromised by prematurity or fetal growth restriction. Such effects have not been consistently linked to moderate consumption.7A reported link between heavy maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and increased risk of SIDS8 (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) has not been supported by further studies.9Breast milk can transfer caffeine from mother to baby. Very high caffeine intake by a nursing mother may make her baby irritable, with disturbed sleep cycles, but this is not known to occur from ordinary food and beverage caffeine intake, or without use of medications containing caffeine. Tips On Cutting Caffeine Out Before Pregnancy... Men, Please Join Us!To cut caffeine out of your diet can be difficult. Many will experience side effects like headaches and cravings. To reduce the risks of these side effects it is recommended that you cut back slowly. For example, a coffee drinker should start with 3/4 of a cup of regular coffee and add 1/4 of decaffeinated coffee. Slowly they will increase the decaffeinated coffee until it is the entire cup.Whether you discontinue caffeine cold turkey or slowly, it will help you to achieve a healthier pregnancy.

When a woman is pregnant, her whole training program has to change. Warnings:Pregnant women should not perform squats, because it can cause the separation of the placenta from the uterus. Also, jerky movements should not be performed. Make sure only light weights are used and every exercise should be done slow and correctly.Remember to breathe when exercising, because you don't want your baby to lose oxygen. Make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before and after you work out. As far as eating goes, eat healthy and eat often. Try to get in 4 to 5 small meals a day. Workout: What is the best workout for pregnant women? Be specific. Include exercises, sets, reps, rest periods, etc. The training program includes light weight training along with cardio. I've included all the major body parts, except for the abdominals and the lower back muscles. I don't think it's safe to train these two muscle groups when pregnant.The training goal of pregnant women isn't to bulk up, but to stay fit, that's why only light weights will be used. Heavy weights shouldn't be used when pregnant, because you could end up hurting yourself and your baby. Each exercise has 3 sets with 15 reps each. Rest periods should be quite short. Keep rest periods between 2 to 3 minutes.Another thing that is important to mention is that a lot of pregnant women have is back pain. This is mainly because 25-30 pounds of weight is gained during pregnancy, with most of the weight distributed around the abdominal area.  RELATED ARTICLE  Back Pain: How Exercise Can Help.   While any form of back pain should be assessed by a qualified medical practitioner, certain exercises can greatly reduce the pain. There are many exercises you can do to improve and prevent back injuries. I have listed those exercises right here. [ Click here to learn more. ] This causes a women's center gravity to shift forward, which results in more curvature in her lower spinal column. A solution for this is stretching. Light stretching should be done occasionally after you warm-up, especially if you want to prevent back pain.Along with weight training is cardio. One of the best cardiovascular activities pregnant women can do is swimming. Swimming can help strengthen your heart muscles and also improve oxygen delivery to the muscles. Swimming also strengthens your shoulder and abdominal muscles, and it reduces high blood pressure and joint stiffness.Swimming is also one of the most relaxing cardiovascular exercises. But when it comes to relaxing exercises, yoga is number one. Yoga is very relaxing and beneficial to pregnant women. Yoga can help you prepare your mind and your body for one of the most fearful parts of pregnancy, labor and birth of your baby.  RELATED ARTICLE  Yoga: Tips And Exercises For Pregnancy.

The training program above gives you the weekend off, so you can rest and pursue your other interests. Every 2 or 3 months, I recommend that you take a whole week off.Also make sure you change your training program a bit every couple of weeks or months. Talk to your doctor as often as possible, to make sure you're in good health. I recommend that you keep a training log and show it to your doctor to make sure that he or she approves of it.  RELATED ARTICLE  So You're Pregnant: Now What?   It is the time many women wait for all their lives. The time when they are going to produce a life of their own. Some people will spend years trying to become pregnant, hoping and praying. [ Click here to learn more. ] Include your workouts and your diet in your training log. For your workouts, write down what time you went and left from the gym, and all the exercises performed along with sets and reps. For your diet, write down everything you ate, the time you ate, the number of calories, and how many grams of fat, carbs, and protein you took in each meal.Do this on a daily basis, and when you give birth to your baby and look back at everything you did, you'll be amazed and proud of your accomplishments.I hope that this article will help you meet your goals while you're pregnant. Just remember to follow through with your goal. Good Luck! 2nd Place - -CK, NSCA-CPT IntroductionTraining while pregnant has many great benefits for the mother as well as the baby. It is very important to get a doctors permission before exercising while pregnant. Although it is usually accepted by doctors it is not a good idea to start an exercise program once found out to be pregnant.The only way exercise should be done during a pregnancy is if the expecting mother was exercising prior to the pregnancy. Exercise should be discontinued if there is bloody discharge from the vagina, any gush of fluid from the vagina, sudden swelling of extremities, severe headaches, dizziness, or swelling and pain in the calf of a leg.High risk exercises should be avoided. Common sense would tell most but snow or water skiing, rock climbing, contact sports, scuba diving, any exercise that involves balance, etc. Cardiovascular Changes:The female body goes through a wide variety of physiological changes during pregnancy. The cardiovascular system is impacted tremendously during pregnancy. Blood volume is increased by 40-50%. Cardiac output increases by 30-50%. Stroke volume is increased by 40%.The resting heart rate increases by 8 beats per minute during the first few weeks of the pregnancy. Resting heart rate is increased even more, up to 20 beats per minute by 32 weeks. The female body's oxygen consumption is increased by 10-20%.By the 2nd or 3rd trimester there is a decrease in maximal work capacity by 20-25%. The use of an RPE (rate of perceived exhaustion) scale is favored over the use of heart rate monitors during pregnancy. Hormonal & Metabolic Changes:There are changes in the levels of progesterone, relaxin and estrogen during pregnancy. The changes in these hormones cause a growth of the uterus as well as breast tissue. There is a decrease in smooth muscle tone as well. The changes in hormones also cause a softening of the ligaments around the joints.This is especially found to be true in the lumbosacral and pelvic areas. The hormone changes usually cause nausea, vomiting, and a decrease in appetite. This is normally during the first trimester. With the metabolic changes a pregnant women should consume an excess of 300 k/cal daily. Musculoskeletal System Changes:The average weight gain of women during pregnancy is 27.5 lbs. With the excess weight gain comes postural changes. They in turn create muscular imbalances. The abdominal wall is stretched. The lumbar spine muscles are shortened and the upper back muscles become long and week. The anterior muscles of the chest and shoulders become really tight. As the baby's head shifts forward muscular activity in the posterior cervical region increase.Benefits Of Exercise During PregnancyWomen can maintain or increase their cardiovascular fitness as well as muscle strength and flexibility. They can also experience less pre-natal discomforts. Some of these discomforts include constipation, swollen extremities, leg cramps, nausea, varicose veins, insomnia, fatigue, back pain, and other orthopedic conditions.Women can improve their posture along with body mechanics. They can also increase their energy levels and blood flow circulation. Women who exercise while pregnant maintain a lower resting heart rate. They also have increased stroke volume and VO2 max.  VO2MAX CALCULATOR  Enter the total distance covered in meters in 12 minutes and then press the 'Calculate' button.  1600 meters = 1 mile 5280 feet = 1 mile 3 feet = 1 meterDistance   meters  ResultsVo2 Max  There is a major decrease in excessive weight gain. There is a major decrease in delivery problems. There is a 75% decrease in having to have a c-section. There is also a 75% decrease in maternal exhaustion. There is a 50% decrease for the need of oxytocin (which helps induce labor).It has been show that there is a 30% decrease in active labor time. After delivery during recovery time it has been shown that there are fewer incidences of post partum depression.Pre-Natal ExerciseThere is not a ""one size fits all"" workout. It needs to be individualized for the pregnant women. They should workout at a level of comfort. That should be between 5-8 on a RPE (rate of perceived exhaustion) scale of 1-10. As the pregnancy progresses farther along it will take smaller levels of work to attain the same RPE.They should always avoid exercising to exhaustion. The duration of exercise should be determined by the intensity. So if the intensity increases the duration must decrease. Cardiovascular exercise should be no longer than 45 minutes in duration.  RELATED ARTICLE  Weight Training & Pregnancy!   After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries. This article will provide guidelines on pre-natal exercise and other health considerations. [ Click here to learn more. ] In the 3rd trimester fetal nutrition and energy balance are very important. If more calories are burned during exercise more must be consumed to help balance out the energy levels. Eating more amounts in the 3rd trimester may be difficult stomach space is smaller and the risk of heartburn.Exercise frequency should be 3-5 days per week. Some studies have shown that women who exercised 5 days per week gave birth to lower weight babies. The only reason for lower birth weights was they had less subcutaneous fat than others. After 5 years those babies showed no differences than babies born at the same time from non-active mothers.It is important to take care of any muscular imbalances caused from the pregnancy. They can lead to discomfort, pain or even injury. The most important muscles to strengthen would be the scapular retractors, abdominals, and pelvic floor. The transverse abdominals should be trained in isolation at first then integrated into other exercises.A strong pelvic floor will help improve controlling and relaxing during labor. These are the five layers of muscle and fascia attached to the pelvis. They support the internal organs and affect bladder, bowel, and sexual functions. Kegal exercises are a great way to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor.

Sucralose: Is This Sweetener Right For You?
Sucralose is the only non-nutritive sweetener made from sugar. Is it safe? Should you use it? Find out here!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/vm2.htm,"Life just got a bit sweeter, actually about 600 times sweeter! The FDA has approved the newest form of no-calorie sweetener, known as Sucralose. Sucralose, made by McNeil Specialty Products (Johnson &Johnson), is the only non-nutritive sweetener made from sugar. It is significantly sweeter than Aspartame, Ace-K, and Saccharin. Because of its origin, it tastes like sugar, but has added benefits and unique properties. Sucralose is exceptionally stable, even in low-pH items (certain beverages), under high temperatures (useful in baking and pasteurization), and in its stand-alone state (tabletop). Its shelf life is superior to all other leading sweeteners. These attributes are the backbone of its outstanding processing versatility. This is a giant step ahead considering that the current limited use of sweeteners in commercial products is primarily due to instability over time and at high temperatures (e.g. Aspartame, or NutraSweet), and due to taste limitations such as with Saccharin and Acesulfame-K (Ace-K).  The taste profile of sucralose is almost identical to sucrose (table sugar). The data above compare the two at neutral pH in a 5% solution. Structurally, Sucralose is almost identical to sucrose. The three hydroxyl groups (-OH) of sucrose have been selectively replaced with atoms of chlorine. These tightly bound chlorine atoms help create a molecular structure that is extremely stable, 600 times sweeter than sugar, a perfect match for sweet taste bud receptors, and metabolically inert. Sucralose flows throughout the body almost unabsorbed and causing no GI distress (often noted with similar additives such as Olestra). It is rapidly excreted, not hydrolyzed or dechlorinated following ingestion, and does not promote dental caries (cavities) nor support the growth of oral bacteria, nor cause changes in the pH of plaque (1, 2, 3). Sucralose is minimally metabolized, leaving the metabolites nontoxic and excreted in urine. Although not a diabetic, as a health care professional I have great appreciation for this advancement because I am involved with diabetic patients everyday in the clinical setting. Because the body does not recognize Sucralose as a carbohydrate, it has no effect on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels (4, 5). The American Dietetic Association states that non-nutritive sweeteners are safe to use and widely advocated and used by persons with diabetes(5). Whether diabetic, obese, or just a health conscious individual, Sucralose is the answer to reducing sugar intake or calorie intake in order to continue enjoying favorite foods. [EDITORS NOTE: The substitution of sugar may also have important implications for weight trainers with sore muscles who commonly experience a state of acute glucose intolerance.] Sucralose also has a few other positive aspects within the realm of health care. It can be used by pregnant women and nursing mothers. Studies have confirmed that Sucralose is not actively transported across the placenta or across mammary glands into breast milk. This sweetener has been found to be non-hazardous to a developing young persons health. However, due to the importance of calories for a growing childs body, foods made with low-calories sweeteners are not normally recommended. Sucralose does not contain phenylalanine (as does Aspartame) or any other additional amino acids, posing no threat to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Quick Fact: Did you know that Americans consume more than DOUBLE the recommended amount of sugar?T he FDA has reviewed over 110 studies involving humans and animals conducted to prove that the consumption of Sucralose is safe. There were also 40 environmental studies completed. These studies depicted that even in extremely high doses there is no evidence of side effects, increased chances of birth defects, immune system problems, toxicity, carcinogenic properties (unlike saccharin), genetic changes, negative effects on male/female reproduction (nor on progeny), or adverse CNS effects. The lack of a warning label for its use is a definite ""feather in the cap"" for Sucralose. After reviewing the numerous studies completed and extensive data, it is obvious that Sucralose will make a run at becoming the best choice ever among low-calorie sweeteners.

Use Of Nutritive And Nonnutritive Sweeteners.
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/md26.htm,"5/1/2003 - It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  J Am Diet Assoc. 1998;98:580-587.  Human beings are born liking the sensation of sweetness. A number of food ingredients stimulate this sensation by interacting with taste buds in the mouth and throat. The sweetening power of these ingredients varies with the properties of the food system, such as physical state, temperature, and the presence of other flavors. Furthermore, perception of sweet taste can be influenced by genetics, health status, and aging (1).  Nutritive sweeteners provide a sweet taste and a source of energy; nonnutritive sweeteners are sweet without providing energy. The claim that nutritive sweeteners have caused an increase in chronic disease (eg, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dental caries, behavioral disorders) is not substantiated (2) but many consumers want the taste of sweetness without added energy.  The food industry has responded to this demand by producing a number of energy-reduced or nonnutritive sweeteners.  Position Statement   It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  Types Of Sweeteners   Although sweeteners can be grouped a number of different ways, the grouping ""nutritive"" and ""nonnutritive"" acknowledges a difference in the amount of energy provided by sweeteners. Nutritive sweeteners include sugar sweeteners (eg, refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, crystalline fructose, glucose, dextrose, corn sweeteners, honey, lactose, maltose, various syrups, invert sugars, concentrated fruit juice) and reduced-energy polyols or sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates).  Nonnutritive sweeteners (eg, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame-K, and sucralose) offer no energy, and, as they sweeten with little volume, can also be referred to as high-intensity sweeteners. Both polyols and nonnutritive sweeteners can replace sugar sweeteners and are therefore termed macronutrient substitutes, sugar substitutes, sugar replacers, or alternative sweeteners.  Some sweeteners are considered Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) ingredients and others are considered food additives. These terms were defined by the 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  The 1958 amendment also states that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve the safety of all additives (3). The safety limit of food additives or conditions of use are expressed as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), that is, the estimated amount per kilogram body weight that a person can safely consume every day over a lifetime without risk.  ADI is a conservative level--it usually reflects an amount 100 times less than the maximum level at which no observed adverse effect occurs in animal (very occasionally human being) studies. The ADI concept is used by FDA and the Joint Expert Committee of Food Additions (JECFA) of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization.  The table provides a summary of the amount of energy provided, the regulatory status, and descriptions of the approved nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners.

Nutritive Sweeteners   The 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey provides estimates of nutritive sweetener consumption in the United States (4,5). Total intake of sugars (those added and naturally occurring in foods) was 94 to 95 g/day for the total population or 21% to 22% of total energy intake. Of this total, sugars added to food were estimated at 53 g/day (4).  The major sources of total sugar for children younger than age 10 years were milk/milk products, fruit drinks, and carbonated soft drinks (5). In adults aged 25 to 50 years, the top 3 food categories contributing to total sugar intake were: other (candy and gum, coffee/tea/alcohol, miscellaneous foods, carbonated soft drinks, and fruit drinks); milk/milk products; and bread, cereal, rice, and pasta (includes cookies, cakes, and pastries).  Consumers can monitor their intake of total sugars through the labels on foods and beverages. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (6) defines labeling of sugars (ie, any monosaccharide or disaccharide) and sugar alcohols. The Act also includes guidelines for labeling a product as ""sugar-free"" (less than 0.5 g sugar), ""reduced sugar"" or ""less sugar"" (a reduction of sugar by 25%), and ""no added sugar"" (no sugars added during processing).  Sugar Sweeteners  Sucrose and fructose, which are GRAS substances, are the primary sugar sweeteners that occur naturally in the food supply or are added as sugars, in corn sweeteners, or in syrups. These sweeteners add functional properties to foods through their effects on sensory (eg, flavor of molasses), physical (eg, crystallization, viscosity), microbial (eg, preservation, fermentation), and chemical (eg, carmelization, antioxidation) characteristics (7).  They all provide a similar amount of energy except in the cases of rare genetic abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism (eg, galactosemia, inherited fructose intolerance). The metabolism of human beings does not distinguish between energy provided from natural and refined sugars.  Although some unrefined nutritive sweeteners provide minerals (eg, molasses contains calcium, iron, magnesium, and potassium), the amount per tablespoon is relatively small compared to the Dietary Reference Intakes (8). Thus, consumers should base their selection of sugar sweeteners on sensory or functional properties, not on misconceptions of differences in nutrient value.  Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose and provides 4 kcal/g (approximately 16 kcal/tsp). Total sucrose intake ranges from 14 to 60 g/day or from 7% to 11% of energy intake (4). Commercially, sucrose comes from processing sugar cane or sugar beets. Refinement removes the yellow-brown pigments of unrefined sugar to produce the white crystal form of table sugar. Molasses is the least refined form of sucrose.  The monosaccharide fructose provides 4 kcal/g. Fructose is a component of sucrose, is present in fruit (also known as fruit sugar or levulose), and is added to foods and beverages as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or in the crystalline form. Fructose is manufactured through the isomerization of dextrose in corn starch.  Fructose has replaced sucrose in many foods and beverages because of its sweetening power and functional properties that enhance flavor, color, and product stability (9). Fructose also synergizes the sweetness potential of sucrose and other nonnutritive sweeteners (9).  Food consumption surveys show an increase in fructose consumption: the ratio of fructose intake as a proportion of total sugars has increased by nearly 30% from the 1977-1978 and 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys (4,9).  High intakes of fructose have implications for gastrointestinal health, blood glucose control, and lipid metabolism. Fructose is primarily absorbed from the gut by facilitated diffusion (10). Persons vary in their abilities to absorb fructose--some experience symptoms of malabsorption with a 20- to 50-g load (11). (A 12-oz sweetened soda or fruit drink has between 14 and 22 g fructose; 1 c apple juice has 14 g fructose.)  Some of the malabsorption of fructose-containing products may be the result of other nutritive sweeteners that are poorly absorbed (eg, sugar alcohols in apple juice). Fructose is better absorbed when consumed in sucrose (10), than in products where the amount of free fructose exceeds the amount of glucose (eg, in honey, prunes, apples and juice, HFCS, or crystalline fructose) (11).  Because of the method of absorption, fructose intake may lead to a slower rise in blood glucose than sucrose-based sweeteners. This fact, along with rapid clearance of fructose from blood serum, may improve glycemic control (12). High intakes of fructose could, theoretically, increase production of lipid precursors and increase the risk of hypertriglyceridemia.  However, this effect is not consistently seen, even in those who are at high risk of elevated plasma triglycerides (13).  The US Food Guide Pyramid (14) encourages consumers to have the smallest proportion of their energy derived from fats, oils, and sugars. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (15) urge consumers to choose a diet moderate in these sources of energy because excessive intake may provide the body with unnecessary energy and few nutrients. However, persons can include sugars in their diets and still consume a healthful diet.  A recent review of intake surveys from both the United States and the European Union showed no consistent or nutritionally meaningful variation in micronutrient intake across the range of sugar intakes (5). The association between sugar intake and nutrient adequacy of the diet has a U shape, suggesting that extreme intakes of sugar (too high or too low) are not optimal.  Persons show adequate nutrient intake across a wide range of sugar intakes (16). Those consuming low amounts of total sugar (less than 26.4 g/1,000 kcal) (17) tended to consume more energy from fat.  Polyols (Sugar Alcohols)  Polyols can also be categorized as sugar replacers (18) because they can replace sugar sweeteners, usually on a one-to-one basis; offer less energy; and offer potential health benefits (eg, reduced glycemic response and reduced dental caries risk). The polyols sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol are found in plant products such as fruits and berries. Commercially, these sweeteners are synthesized and not extracted from natural sources.  All polyols are absorbed slowly and incompletely from the intestine by passive diffusion. Therefore, an excessive load (eg, greater than 50 g sorbitol per day,greater than 20 g mannitol per day) may cause diarrhea. If polyols were completely absorbed, direct metabolism could provide the usual 4 kcal/g.  However, incomplete absorption causes indirect metabolism of polyols via fermentive degradation by the intestinal flora. The energy return from indirect metabolism is less than the direct route; thus, polyols are referred to as reduced-energy or low-energy sweeteners. FDA allows these nutritive sweeteners to be labeled as having fewer kilocalories per gram than other nutritive sweeteners. (See the Table for kilocalories per gram for eachpolyol.)  The safety and use of polyols has been extensively reviewed (19,20). Because of the incomplete absorption, polyols produce a low glycemic response. Products with sorbitol and mannitol may have the following statement on the label because high intakes increase the risk of malabsorption: ""excess consumption may have a laxative effect.""  Sorbitol is on the GRAS list for use in candies, chewing gum, jams/jellies, baked goods, and frozen confections. Mannitol is permitted for use on an interim basis pending further study of health effects. The interim status is provided to food additives that have a history of use but their safety has been brought into question by new information, even if it is not conclusive (21).  Mannitol is used as a dusting agent for chewing gum and a bulking agent in powdered foods. Xylitol is approved as a GRAS food additive for use in chewing gums, candies, pharmaceuticals, and hygiene products. A petition for GRAS status has been accepted for filing by FDA for isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH), and erythritol. These polyols are used in confections and/or as bulking agents.  Nonnutritive Sweeteners   The United States leads the world in consumption of high-intensity sweeteners, consuming approximately 50% of the world demand (22). High-intensity sweeteners can offer consumers a way to enjoy the taste of sweetness with little or no energy intake or glycemic response. Nonnutritive sweeteners may assist in weight management, control of blood glucose, and prevention of dental caries.  The food industry evaluates these sweeteners for many attributes, including sensory qualities (eg, clean sweet taste, no bitterness, odorless), safety, compatibility with other food ingredients, and stability in different food environments. The trend in the food industry is to blend high-intensity sweeteners.  Blending can cause sweetness synergy (ie, the combination is sweeter than the individual components), which can decrease the amount of sweetener needed and can improve the overall sweet taste.  FDA has approved 4 nonnutritive sweeteners and regulates them as food additives: saccharin (on an interim basis pending additional study), aspartame, acesulfame potassium (or acesulfame-K), andsucralose.  Saccharin  Saccharin exceeds the sweetness of sugar 200 to 700 times (23). It provides no energy, as it is not metabolized by human beings (23), and it is not cariogenic. The FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition estimates the daily use of saccharin at 50 mg per person per day.  The JECFA has set the ADI for saccharin at 5 mg/kg body weight per day (24). Despite the decline in use, saccharin is the largest-volume, lowest-cost high-intensity sweetener used in the world (nearly 62 million lb were used in 1995) (22). It is approved for use in more than 100 countries.  Saccharin was originally included on the GRAS listing. In 1977, FDA placed a ban on use of saccharin because it was reported to be a carcinogen in rats. In the same year, Congress, through the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act, imposed an 18- month moratorium on the FDA ban and required products containing saccharin to bear the following warning: ""Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.""  Congress has extended this moratorium 7 times, the last to continue through May 2002. In 1991, FDA formally withdrew the proposed ban and considers saccharin to be a food additive on an interim basis for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foods and beverages, tabletop sugar substitutes, and chewing gum.  The amount of saccharin must appear on the food label and is limited to no more than 12 mg/oz in beverages, 20 mg per sweetening equivalent of 1 tsp sugar, or no more than 30 mg per food serving (21).  Since 1981, saccharin has been listed as an ""anticipated"" human carcinogen (25). Studies of high users (ie, persons with diabetes) do not support an association between saccharin and cancer (26,27). However, subgroups of persons (eg, male heavy smokers) may present increased risk (25).  The advisory board for the National Toxicology Program did not recommend removal of saccharin from the Report on Carcinogens, Ninth Edition (report in preparation).  Aspartame  Aspartame a dipeptide (methyl ester of l-aspartic acid and l-phenylalanine) is 160 to 220 times sweeter than sucrose. Intestinal esterases hydrolyze aspartame to aspartic acid, methanol, and phenylalanine (28). The amino acids are metabolized to provide 4 kcal/g. Thus, this sweetener does provide energy; however, because of the intense sweetness of aspartame, the amount of energy derived from it is negligible.  In 1981, FDA approved aspartame as a sweetener for a number of dry uses (eg, tabletop sweetener, cold breakfast cereal, gelatins, puddings) and in chewing gum and carbonated beverages. In 1985, the Council on Scientific Affairs of The American Medical Association concluded that ""Available evidence suggests that consumption of aspartame by normal humans is safe and is not associated with serious adverse health effects"" (29, p 400).  FDA has evaluated aspartame use in food and beverages 26 times since its original approval. In 1996, FDA approved aspartame as a general-purpose sweetener for use in all foods and beverages. Aspartame is also approved for use in more than 100 nations.  Demand for aspartame in the United States rose from 8.4 million lb in 1986 to 17.5 million lb in 1992, a figure that represents more than 80% of the world demand. Although soft drinks account for more than 70% of aspartame consumption, this sweetener is added to more than 6,000 foods, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.  Aspartame is available in liquid, granular, encapsulated, and powder forms to extend its use in food and beverage products. The encapsulated form has made aspartame more heat stable and has extended its use in some commercially baked products.  Detailed studies have been conducted to determine how ingestion influences plasma levels of aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol (or the by-product formate). In studies of healthy adults (30), a bolus load (up to 200 mg/kg) did not alter levels of plasma aspartate concentrations or blood levels of formate. Plasma phenylalanine response to aspartame varies genetically.  Persons with phenylketonuria, a homozygous recessive inborn error of metabolism, are unable to metabolize phenylalanine. In persons with this rare (frequency is approximately 1 in 10,000 whites) inborn error, excess intake of this amino acid causes higher plasma levels and altered synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters (31) and adverse effects (32).  Thus, medical nutrition therapy for phenylketonuria involves the control of dietary sources of phenylalanine, including aspartame. Foods containing aspartame must, by FDA requirements, contain a label indicating that they contain phenylalanine.  Persons with phenylketonuria appear to tolerate the amount of phenylalanine in diet soda sweetened with aspartame (approximately 104 mg/12 oz) (33). Heterozygotes for phenylketonuria do not show changes in cognitive performance or in electroencephalograms after 12 weeks of consuming either 15 or 45 mg/kg aspartame per day (34).  In persons without phenylketonuria, single bolus studies of aspartame (up to 50 mg/kg body weight) or repeat dose studies show a plasma phenylalanine response near the normal postprandial range and considerably lower than that observed in persons with phenylketonuria or those with mild hyperphenylalanemia (30).  Aspartame breaks down to diketopiperazine in liquid systems with heat exposure and loses it sweetness. Animal toxicity studies show that even if all aspartame was converted to diketopiperazine in beverages, the amount would be well below the ADI of 3,000 mg/kg for diketopiperazine (35).  Some persons report allergic reactions to aspartame, including edema of the lips, tongue, and throat; dermatologic reactions; and respiratory problems (36). However, 2 double- blind challenge studies report difficulty recruiting persons who claim an allergic response to aspartame and failure to reproduce the allergic reaction in controlled experiment conditions (37,38).  FDA increased ADI for aspartame to its current level of 50 mg/kg body weight when it was approved for use in carbonated beverages. Post market assessment of aspartame shows that estimated daily intake of aspartame is below this ADI (39): aspartame eaters (at least 90th percentile of consumption) in the general population consume 6% of the ADI (3.0 mg/kg per day) and those aged 1 to 5 years consume 10.4% of the ADI (5.2 mg/kg per day).  Food labels can help consumers identify foods and beverages that contain aspartame, although the amount is not generally labeled. Consumers would need to contact the companies to determine the amount of aspartame in each product. Nonetheless, the amount in some common foods is: up to 225 mg in a 12-oz diet soda, 100 mg in an 8-oz drink made from powder, 80 mg in an 8-oz yogurt or a 4-oz gelatin dessert, up to 32 mg in 3/4 c sweetened cereal, and up to 47 mg in 1/2 c frozen dairy dessert.  As a tabletop sweetener, packets contain 37 mg aspartame and are equivalent to the sweetness of 2 tsp sugar. In the granular form, 1 tsp contains 16 mg aspartame and equals the sweetening of 1 tsp sugar. To reach the ADI, an 18 kg (nearly 40 lb) child would need to consume 900 mg aspartame per day, which translates to 24 packets of sweetener (equivalent to 48 tsp sugar), four 12-oz cans of diet soda, or nine 8-oz glasses of fruit drink made from a powder.  Acesulfame-K  Acesulfame-K (5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide) is approximately 200 times sweeter than sucrose. The ""K"" refers to potassium. Acesulfame-K can withstand high cooking/baking temperatures. Blends of acesulfame-K with other nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners can synergize the sweetness potential and decrease the bitter taste. This sweetener does not provide any energy; it is not metabolized by the body and is excreted in the urine unchanged.  This sweetener was evaluated for safety by JECFA in 1983 (40,41). FDA approved acesulfame-K in 1988. Both regulatory groups have set an ADI of 15 mg/kg body weight. In the United States, acesulfame-K is approved for use as a tabletop sweetener and as an additive in chewing gum, confections, desserts, yogurt, sauces, and alcoholic beverages (21).  FDA is reviewing acesulfame-K for use in nonalcoholic beverages. The tabletop sweetener contains approximately 0.4 g acesulfame-K per packet. The amount of acesulfame-K added to food products is very small because of its intense sweetening power and because it is often used in combination with other sweeteners.  Sucralose  Sucralose (trichlorogalactosucrose) is 600 times sweeter than sucrose. Sucralose provides no energy; it is not well absorbed and is excreted in the urine essentially unchanged. This sweetener is heat stable in cooking and baking.  Sucralose was approved in April 1998 as a tabletop sweetener and for use in a number of desserts, confections, and nonalcoholic beverages. FDA concluded from a review of more than 110 studies in human beings and animals that this sweetener did not pose carcinogenic, reproductive, or neurologic risk to human beings. In 1990, JECFA increased the temporary ADI from 0 to 3.5 mg/kg body weight to 0 to 15 mg/kg body weight (42).  Nonnutritive Sweeteners Not Yet Approved In The United States   Alitame  A petition for alitame as a tabletop sweetener and for use in a range of products including baked goods, beverages, and confections was submitted to FDA in 1986. Alitame is composed of l-aspartic acid, d-alanine, and a novel C-terminal amide moiety and is 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose without the bitter or metallic qualities of high-intensity sweeteners (43).  This sweetener blends with other high-intensity sweeteners to maximize the quality of sweetness. From an oral load of alitame, 7% to 22% is unabsorbed and excreted in the feces. The remaining amount (78% to 93%) is hydrolyzed to aspartic acid and alanine amide.  The aspartic acid is metabolized normally and the alanine amide is excreted in the urine as a sulfoxide isomer, sulfone, or conjugated with glucuronic acid. The incomplete absorption and metabolism results in a core value of 1.4 kcal/g.  In 1995, JEFCA concluded that alitame was not carcinogenic and did not show reproductive toxicity (44). However, recommendations on an ADI await further research on its safety. In the FDA petition, the estimated daily intake is 0.34 mg/kg body weight, which represents the amount if alitame was used as the only sweetener in a person's diet.  The level at which no observed adverse effects occurred in animals was 100 mg/kg (43). Alitame is approved for use in food and beverages in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the People's Republic of China.  Cyclamate  FDA banned this sweetener as a food ingredient in 1969 because the saccharin/cyclamate mixture was shown to cause cancer in laboratory mice (45). The primary concern was that it could be carcinogenic to some persons who appear to metabolize cyclamate to cyclohexylamine (46). To support a petition for use of cyclamate in 1982, the Cancer Assessment Committee of FDA reviewed the scientific evidence and concluded that cyclamate was not carcinogenic.  This was reaffirmed in 1985 by the National Academy of Sciences (47). The petition to reapprove cyclamate in the United States is still under review by FDA. This sweetener is more than 30 times sweeter than sucrose and is approved for use by more than 50 countries.  Sweetener Use In Segments Of The Population   Children  Because of their size and relatively high food and fluid intakes compared with adults, children will have the highest intake of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners as calculated by milligram intake per kilogram body weight. Children can safely consume nutritive sweeteners within a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines.  Children have shown a substantial increase in intake of fructose, presumably through intake of sweetened drinks and fruit drinks (5). Healthy young children (aged 6 to 18 months) can exhibit carbohydrate malabsorption (eg, fructose and sorbitol) with ingestion of common fruit juices (eg, apple juice) (48). (One cup apple juice can contain 14 g fructose and 2.5 g sorbitol.)  Children who exhibit nonspecific diarrhea may benefit from a reduction in fructose and products containing polyols.  It has been suggested that caregivers may want to limit intake of saccharin by young children because of the limited amount of data available for its use in children (49). The estimated daily intake of aspartame in children ranges from 8 to 17 mg/kg body weight in children aged 2 to 5 years, which is below the acceptable daily intake of 50 mg/kg body weight. Intakes of acesulfame-K in children are also below ADI (ranges from 3 to 9 mg/kg body weight).  Pregnant Women  Use of nutritive sweeteners that have GRAS status is acceptable during pregnancy. Recommendations for nonnutritive sweetener use during pregnancy must be based on well-designed and approved clinical investigations to ensure a healthy pregnancy and healthy babies. Saccharin can cross the placenta and may remain in fetal tissues because of slow fetal clearance (50). It has been suggested that women consider careful use of saccharin during pregnancy (49).  The issue with aspartame in pregnancy relates to fetal exposure to aspartic acid, phenylalanine, or methanol. In animals, an aspartame load does not change fetal exposure to aspartic acid (51). Fetal circulation levels of phenylalanine exceed maternal levels because of concentration across the placental barrier (52).  A bolus of aspartame (34 mg/kg or the 99th percentile of estimated daily intake) results in a peak plasma level of phenylalanine in normal subjects (112 micromol/L)1 and phenylketonuric heterozygotes (162 micromol/L) below the level that would cause neurological problems in the fetus (1,090 micromol/L) (53).  Plasma response of methanol and formate were not significant after an aspartame load. Thus, if placental transport of these compounds occurs, the amount is not clinically harmful (54). Use of aspartame within FDA guidelines appears safe for pregnant women.  Safety of acesulfame-K use during pregnancy has been determined with rat studies. (JECFA has determined that rats are an appropriate model for human beings.) At high levels (3% of the diet), there was no change observed in fertility, size of litter, body weight, growth, or mortality (55). Thus, use of acesulfame-K within FDA guidelines appears safe for pregnant women.  1 To convert micromol/L phenylalanine to mg/dL, multiply micromol/L by 0.01652. To convert mg/dL phenylalanine to micromol/L, multiply mg/dL by 60.54. Phenylalanine of 300 micromol/L=4.96 mg/dL.  Sweetener Use In Chronic Conditions   Behavioral Disorders  Claims of an association between sugar and hyperactivity have not been supported (56), even in those children who, by report, are sensitive to sugar (57). In fact, some research supports that persons with negative mood states (eg, seasonal affective disorders, alcohol withdrawal) should consume carbohydrate-rich foods, including sweets, as a way of alleviating their condition (58).  The mechanism by which carbohydrate, including sugars, may affect mood is not certain, but may involve the synthesis and release of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin controls functions such as temperature regulation, sensory perception, onset of sleep, and appetite. Control of brain levels of serotonin is of current interest for the management of depression, mood disorders, and appetite.  The alleged association between hyperactivity and aspartame is not scientifically supported (56,57). Some consumers report behavioral side-effects of aspartame (eg, headache, dizziness, mood alteration) related to the central nervous system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed 600 of these behavior complaints and concluded that there was no association (59).  Controlled clinical studies do not show an association between aspartame intake and seizures in sensitive children (60) or difficulties with cognitive and behavioral tasks in children with attention deficit disorder (61).  The association claimed between aspartame intake and risk of brain tumors has not been supported. A recent report hypothesized that aspartame use since its approval in 1981 had contributed to an increased incidence of brain tumors (61,62). However, FDA, using data from an analysis of the National Cancer Institute's database on cancer incidence in the United States (63), found a flattening of the rate of brain cancer since 1985 with a slight decrease from 1991 to 1993.  With consideration of these findings with other data reviewed at the time of approval, FDA continues to support the original approval of aspartame.  Dental Caries  Risk of dental caries increases with intake of nutritive sugars, however, this risk does not work independently from factors such as oral hygiene and fluoridation (64). Use of polyol-based gum can reduce the risk of dental caries compared to sucrose-sweetened gum, with the greatest benefit from xylitol-based gums (65).  FDA authorizes use of the health claim in food labeling that sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol) do not promote tooth decay (66). Nonnutritive sweeteners do not promote dental caries.  Diabetes Mellitus  The primary goal for disease management in persons with diabetes mellitus is to maintain near-normal blood glucose levels. Nutritive sweeteners do not produce greater increase in blood glucose response than complex starches, as was previously believed (67). Intake as high as 60 g fructose or sucrose per day may not adversely affect glycemic or lipid response in persons with type 2 diabetes (68).  Although it is recognized that carbohydrate sources provide different glycemic responses, the clinical perspective is that attention should be given first to the total amount of carbohydrate consumed rather than the source of carbohydrate (69).  The selection of healthful foods within the context of the Food Guide Pyramid and with attention to energy intake and blood glucose control is recommended for the management of diabetes (69).  Nonnutritive sweeteners are also appropriate in meal plans for persons with diabetes and may help control of energy intake. Dietetics practitioners can help persons with diabetes incorporate nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners into their individual meal plans.  Hyperlipidemia  Usual intakes of sucrose or fructose do not elevate plasma triglycerides in most persons, including those with diabetes, provided that energy balance is unchanged (13). However, very high intakes of dietary fructose and sucrose (approximately 2 to 3 times usual consumption) can result in elevations of plasma triglycerides (12). At this time there is no evidence that current levels of fructose intake contribute tohyperlipidemia.  Obesity  Excess body fat (obesity) arises from the energy imbalance caused by taking in too much energy and using too little. Perhaps because sugar adds hedonic value to many foods and beverages it has been hypothesized that sugar plays a major role in the etiology of obesity. There are several arguments against this hypothesis. First, sugars suppress appetite to the same extent as other carbohydrates (4).  Second, there is no relationship between the per capita amount of sugar available in the food supply and the incidence of obesity in the population (70). Third, epidemiologic studies show an inverse relationship between sugar intake and obesity (71) and a direct relationship between obesity and fat intake (72) and the ratio of fat to sugar in the diet (16). Obesity is a complex problem and its cause cannot be simply attributed to any 1 component of the food supply.  The contribution of nonnutritive sweeteners to obesity management is unclear. The original motivation for their development was based on the goal of providing a sweet taste without added energy to persons with diabetes and those wanting to control energy intake. Nonnutritive sweeteners can save the consumer up to 16 kcal/tsp sweetening.  Theoretically, if total intake of sugars (estimated at 95 g or approximately 24 tsp/day) were replaced by nonnutritive sweeteners, this could result in a deficit of 380 kcal/day or a 1 lb weight loss in 9 to 10 days. One study has shown that the addition of aspartame- sweetened foods and beverages to a multidisciplinary weight-control program facilitated long-term maintenance of reduction in body weight in obese women (73).  However, obesity prevalence has increased substantially at the same time as the consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners has increased. The rise in prevalence clearly relates to all factors that cause an energy imbalance.  Therefore, persons who wish to lose weight may choose to use nonnutritive sweeteners but should do so within the context of a sensible weight management program including a sensible diet and enjoyable exercise.  Implications For Dietetics Professionals   Sweetness can add pleasure to eating, and today consumers can enjoy a wide range of sweeteners in a wide variety of foods and beverages. Both food labeling and the range of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners allow choice in the type and amount of sweeteners to include in the diet.  Consumers can incorporate nutritive sweeteners into a healthful eating plan and meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The food label also provides information to consumers on types and amounts of nutritive sweeteners in food and beverages.  Nonnutritive sweeteners are safe for use by most persons within the approved guidelines. The trend in sweetener blending will maximize sweetener potential and help to support intakes of nonnutritive sweeteners well within the acceptable levels. As new nonnutritive sweeteners emerge, the safety of these substitutes used alone or in combination with other nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners and macronutrient substitutes, such as fat replacers, will need to be examined.  Additionally, national surveillance of intake of both nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners is important to determine if they help consumers meet the recommended dietary goals.

Hungry, Hungry Hormones - Part 2.
The peripheral effects of Leptin include interactions with many hormones of the body as well as interactions with the skeletal muscle, the immune system, and the reproductive system...
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/berardi58.htm,"Express Yourself   As discussed last week in Part I, Leptin is a hormone produced when the OB (obesity) gene is expressed. While I've already discussed one mechanism to induce OB gene expression and Leptin production.  The Three Main Cellular Signals Involved Are: Increased energy/carbohydrate flux through the HBP.  Increased triacylglycerol (triglyceride) metabolites. These include diacylglycerols and/or free fatty acids.  Increased tension in adipose tissue due to cellular stretching (increases in adipose size).As you can see, these three phenomena provide response mechanisms whereby both acute and chronic overfeeding or underfeeding will influence OB gene expression and Leptin production. If overfeeding, more carbohydrates will flux through HBP, more triglycerides will be metabolized, and adipose tissue sizes will increase. This leads to more Leptin production. Conversely, if underfeeding, carbohydrate and triglyceride availability will be decreased, as will adipose tissue size. Of course, this means less Leptin. Since we now know why Leptin is formed, how about discussing where it's formed? In adult humans, most of the body's leptin is formed in white adipose tissue. This should be self-evident from the signals discussed above. However, Leptin has also been found in the following tissues, making it relatively ubiquitous.  Leptin Is Also Found In: Brown adipose tissue Gastric epithelium Placenta Skeletal muscle Mammary glands  Rats & Fat Loss   When Leptin was originally discovered, scientists found that rats that had mutations in the OB gene (and couldn't produce Leptin) became insanely obese. Now when I say obese, I'm not talking a little overweight here. I'm talking so obese that members of NAAFA actually pointed and laughed.    Healthy Obsessions.  We have choices to make about our weight and it is within our power to exercise these choices.  [ Click here to learn more. ] In the obese rats, the extreme obesity was caused by mutations in the Ob gene. In these animals, there was simply too little Leptin. Interestingly, when administered Leptin, these tubby rats saw big increases in metabolic rate and lost massive amounts of body fat.  As a result of these findings, researchers speculated that Leptin might be a magical fat loss hormone.  Unfortunately for the pharmaceutical companies who immediately jumped all over the rights to sell recombinant Leptin, this hypothesis didn't pan out. You see, another model of rat was discovered, a model that was as obese as the Leptin deficient rats but had adequate Leptin concentrations in the blood. These rats, instead of a Leptin deficiency, had problems with their Leptin receptor. Therefore the Leptin that was present couldn't do its job. In addition to this new rodent data, thwarting the potential billions to be gained from Leptin sales, new human data also showed that Leptin was unlikely to help the obese drop those few hundred unwanted pounds.  Research Had Clearly Demonstrated That: Very few obese humans actually suffer from Ob gene mutations Very few obese humans actually suffer from Leptin receptor mutations Obese humans often have very high concentrations of leptin in the plasmaSince obese humans often have so much Leptin, research has been directed toward how these individuals can have so much Leptin, yet fail to respond with a reduction in body weight, as did our furry rodent friends. One hypothesis that has gained popularity suggests that a Leptin resistance causes human obesity.  In other words, the very obese got this way because they were somehow intolerant to rising Leptin. As one researcher put it, ""Leptin resistance is not well defined, however this term is usually used to mean that leptin does not perform its central and peripheral functions."" At this point, there is some evidence for the Leptin resistance hypothesis. Since Leptin seems to have central effects, the saturable blood brain barrier transport system for leptin may be linked to obesity. Since obese humans have a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) to plasma ratio that is much lower than normal-sized humans, it appears that only so much Leptin can get across the BBB into the brain.  In addition, in rats, dietary induced obesity (DIO) is accompanied by high plasma leptin concentrations. This leptin doesn't seem to prevent the obesity. However, when administered intracerebroventricular leptin (leptin into the brain), they lose weight, indicating a potential BBB transport limit. Although these data offer support to the idea that there is a limit to amount of leptin allowed into the brain and therefore a type of Leptin ""resistance"" exists at the higher levels of Leptin production, some authors believe that leptin resistance is actually a misnomer.  These researchers are of the opinion that since leptin may not be designed to function in such high concentrations as seen in obesity, Leptin may be more important in its absence than its presence (i.e. may be more important in calorie restriction and not in calorie excess, as is often seen with obesity).  In other words, it's not that the obese are ""improperly"" responding to their leptin. Instead, these authors are suggesting that the obese aren't ""supposed"" to have so much leptin and therefore don't respond to it's elevation above a certain point.   What Does Leptin Do?   The hormone Leptin seems to affect nearly every system of the body. Since there are Leptin receptors in the brain and throughout the body, we can discuss the effects of Leptin as central or peripheral.  Since Leptin is released (mostly) by adipose tissues, adipose tissue seems to be a peripheral static indicator of the chronic energy balance of the body. Once released into the blood, under normal conditions, Leptin travels across the blood brain barrier and is sensed by the Leptin receptors in the hypothalamus.  Since these receptors have some idea of what's a ""normal"" Leptin signal, changes in Leptin binding initiates the release of a series of anabolic (orexigenic or meal stimulating) and catabolic (anorexigenic or meal preventing) hormones/neurotransmitters. An increase in leptin leads to the expression of several anorexigenic (catabolic) hormones and neurotransmitters including MSH and CART. These chemicals decrease hunger and meal size. Conversely, a decrease in leptin leads to the expression of several orexigenic (anabolic) hormones and neurotransmitters including NPY and AgRP. These compounds increase hunger and meal size. This is a rather nice way for the body to deal with energy surplus or energy deficit. If there's a surplus, Leptin increases, signaling the hypothalamus to tell the body to stop eating.  Conversely, if there's a deficit, Leptin decreases, signaling the hypothalamus to make us really hungry. For you visual learners, here's a visual depiction of what happens when Leptin concentrations increase in the hypothalamus.  Click to view large version. Although I only mentioned a couple key orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones/neurotransmitters, there are many others that can interact with Leptin or the same signaling systems as Leptin. These are listed below:          Orexigenic        (stimulate food intake) - May act in the lateral hypothalamic neurons        Anorexigenic        (reduce food intake) - May act on the ventral & dorsal medial hypothalamusNeuropeptide Y (NPY) - is the most potent orexiant known; may respond to aberrant leptin signaling; antagonism may reduce hunger and fat massPro-Opiomelanocortin (POMC) - precursor to MSHAgouti Related Peptide (AgRP) - potent orexiant; may respond to absent leptin; antagonism may reduce hunger and fat massMelanocyte Stimulating Hormone (MSH) - decreases food intake; may respond to increased leptin; antagonism increases appetite and foodMelanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH) - receives signals from NPY to increase food intakeMelanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) - MSH receptor; binding of agonist reduces food intakeOrexin - increases arousal and food intakeCocaine Amphetamine Related Transcript (CART) - decreases food intake; may respond to increased leptinGhrelin - a potent GH releasing hormone released from the stomach, pituitary, and hypothalamus; increases food intake and body weight; may compete with leptinCCK - gastric released peptide; increases satiety; reduces food intake (single feeding and meal frequencyCorticotropin releasing factor (CRF) - regulates adrenal hormones and ACTH; decreases food intake, increases energy expenditureInsulin - increasing concentrations of insulin decrease appetite While these energy regulating hormones and neurotransmitters may be relatively new to you, the important message here is that they are responsible for sensing a starvation response (with decreased Leptin).  In Response To These Decreases In Leptin Concentrations, These Chemicals Are Responsible For Promoting The Following Effects: Increased food intake Decreased skeletal muscle growth Decreased energy expenditure Decreased body temperature Decreased reproductive function Increased adrenal production of stress hormones Increased parasympathetic toneConversely, these energy regulating hormones and neurotransmitters are responsible for sensing an energy surplus (with increased Leptin).  Therefore, When Leptin Concentrations Increase, The Following Effects Are Promoted: Decreased food intake Increased energy expenditure Increased sympathetic toneAgain, for you visual kids, here's a schematic. Remember, Leptin is regulated in response to acute feeding as well as chronic energy balance (as measured by adipose mass). Therefore, while you'll see weight gain and weight loss as regulators below, you could replace these terms with underfeeding and overfeeding.  Click to view large version. Notice that the main discussion today has centered on the central effects of Leptin (in the hypothalamus). However, Leptin, as discussed earlier, also has a number of peripheral effects.  The Peripheral Effects Include The Following: In skeletal muscle, leptin increases fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity, explaining part of its effect on weight reduction.  Leptin may act in concert with the immune system since leptin deficient animals have reduced immunity. This may explain part of the effect of dieting on weakened immune function.  Leptin may play a permissive role in female menarche since there is an inverse relationship between Leptin concentrations and age of first menstruation. This means girls with more body fat (and higher Leptin concentrations) may have first menstruation sooner than leaner girls.  Leptin concentrations and Testosterone concentrations are inversely proportional through the normal range of Testosterone. This means that as Leptin goes up, Testosterone down. Conversely, as Leptin goes down, Testosterone goes up. This should be no surprise as very overweight men are often hypogonadal. However, you should wonder why those who are extremely lean are often hypogonadal as well.  The paradox of this relationship is that leptin is partly responsible for increasing GnRH secretion as well as LH, FSH, and Testosterone secretion. Therefore, at very low concentrations there would be an occurrence of hypogonadism. But very high concentrations, Leptin directly inhibits Testosterone release (leptin decreases T secretion from testis, even in spite of increased GnRH activity), again causing hypogonadism.  Therefore the best Leptin concentrations would be at the low normal range. Not coincidentally, this usually occurs in those lean individuals who are well fed. In Addition To These Peripheral Effects, Leptin Has Shown The Following Interactions With Other Hormones:   Leptin increases GnRH at hypothalamus Leptin decreases Testosterone at testis Glucocorticoids increase plasma leptin SNS activity (epinephrine) decreases plasma leptin Testosterone decreases plasma leptin Insulin acts with leptin by stimulating the same neuronal populations Insulin increases Ob gene expression Ghrelin competes with leptin centrally, with opposite actions as leptin Leptin and insulin sensitize the hindbrain to the anorexigenic hormone CCK The Following Adipocytokines (hormones released from adipose) May Also Interact With Leptin:  ResistinAdipocytokine that may regulate insulin sensitivity AdiponectinEnhances insulin function Increases with insulin and decreases with obesity Increases UCP2 in muscle Increases fatty acid transporter protein Increases acyl CoA oxidase Decreases triglyceride content in liver and muscle AdipsinIs found in proportion to adiposity Is required for the synthesis of ASP (acylation stimulating protein  is involved in the uptake and esterification of TAG and FA) Stimulates TAG synthesis more than insulin  Conclusion   What's that sound? Oh, that's the bell! Quickly I'd like to recap this week's lesson. First of all, Leptin is released from many peripheral tissues but the biggest player is white adipose. Once released, Leptin has all kinds of divergent effects on the peripheral systems of the body, many of which are just coming to light. These peripheral effects include interactions with many hormones of the body as well as interactions with the skeletal muscle, the immune system, and the reproductive system. Also, Leptin acts centrally in order to stir up a neurotransmitter soup of meal stimulating and meal reducing chemicals. These central and peripheral effects are important to understand as they are ultimately responsible for metabolic changes with feeding as well as weight gain and loss. So class is now dismissed for this week. But don't miss out on next week's lecture. I'll be reviewing some of the important feeding studies and discussing some recent data showing how recombinant Leptin injections may actually help prevent the metabolic decline associated with dieting.

Nicole Moneer's Guide To A Fit First Trimester
Physique competitors get to the pinnacle of their sport by taking precise control of their diet, training, and lifestyle. When she got pregnant, Nicole Moneer experienced a different kind of ""body building!""
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/nicole-moneer-guide-to-a-fit-first-trimester.html,"There I was at age 41a personal trainer, former IFBB bikini pro, and cardio kickboxing teacher, and I was out of breath climbing up the stairs! I needed to take it down a notch and rest, even though my head said go, go, go.Vital Stats Name: Nicole Moneer Location: Chicago, Illinois  Occupation: NASM Personal trainer, CHEK holistic lifestyle coach  Experience: Retired IFBB bikini pro, Team Bodybuilding.com sponsored athlete What happened? The same thing that's been happening to women since the dawn of time: I got pregnant! I didn't feel it all the time yet, but every day my body was sending me louder messages that I couldn't ignore. A lot of us in the fitness and health industry live constantly in the train-hard mode, but that has to change when you're pregnant. I was growing a little human, and I've never done that before! Most people say the first trimester is the hardest, and I found it to be true, if only because it's the trimester that's the most unique for every woman. The cravings, nausea, energy levels and emotionsdid I already mention the cravings?run the gamut! Here's how I adjusted my training, nutrition, and supplementation during this crucial time. I want to help you feel better and preserve as much of your fitness level as you can. You'll need it just a few months from now!Training During the First TrimesterIf you're already used to thinking in terms of 12-week stretches from following fitness plans like those on Bodybuilding.com, great. That's how long your first trimester is! And just like a 12-week transformation, there are some sleepless nights, hunger pains, and of course, the fear you're not doing it all exactly the way you had hoped to. Believe me, I experienced all of these. Of course, not all women train with weights while they're pregnant. Depending on your pregnancy and any complications you're experiencing, it may not even be an option for you. But it was for me, and that was a huge relief! My time in the weight room is important to me, both mentally and physically. My pregnancy never fully removed me from training, but I did make adjustments as my body and energy levels changed. Make no mistake, though: ""crushing it"" was no longer my highest priority. You hear a lot of people saying that you'll need to ""listen to your body"" during this time, but this doesn't necessarily mean ""Hey, I feel great, so I can push it harder today."" On the contrary, my body let me know when I needed to back off in intensity or skip an exercise entirely.   My time in the weight room is important to me, both mentally and physically. Here are some of the other modifications I found helpful: Instead of weight training 4-5 times per week, I started going 3-4, and eventually less.My rest days weren't active-rest days. Often, I was sleeping! For the first three months I went to bed between 6 and 8 p.m. and slept all the way through until about 8 a.m. That's more than what I'm used to, but it felt totally necessary! I avoided any exercise that required me to lie on my stomach, or which resulted in any pain or pulling on the midsection. This is a rule you'll hear from doctors and other experts. I lowered the amount of weight I liftedoften dramatically. Pregnant powerlifting is not a sport!Use seated variations. For certain exercises, it feels more comfortable to sit down on a chair, bench, or stability ball.I avoided hot yoga, which can damage a baby's organs in the first trimester. This had been a weekly ritual for me, so it was a tough change. Also off limits: saunas and hot tubs. Soreness from my exercise went up, so I doubled down on stretching and foam rolling. I teach Pilates with my clients, and I found that it helped me maintain my strength and flexibility. Prenatal yoga was also a great addition!As you can see, you have options. Explore them, and use them!When Cravings Attack I was in horrible health when I was younger. But today, I feel and look better at 41 than I did at 21, and a lot of that is because of how I eat. Since 2006, I've been committed to healthy eating: organic vegetables, healthy fats, and grass-fed antibiotic hormone-free protein sources. But during my first trimester, my body decided it wanted to go on a nutritional adventure and drag me kicking and screaming all the way! Everybody has a craving story. Here's mine. Before I knew I was pregnant, I felt extremely thirsty and was hungry all the time, but not for anything in particular. Then, all of a sudden, it got very particular. For instance, I'm a big greens fan, but I rarely eat fruit. Before I became pregnant, I ate different vegetables throughout the day. Then, all of a sudden, I could barely stomach green vegetables, and I craved mangoes, berries, grapefruit, apples, and pears constantly! I didn't have a dark leafy green salad for over two months, which was very alien to me.   I feel and look better at 41 than I did at 21, and a lot of that is because of how I eat. Then it got weirder. When I hit Week 7, I craved everything I had been rejecting for the last few years. ""Pizza and cake, now!"" was what my body was telling me, and I had no choice but to listen. I would even wake up in the middle of the night to eat. I had to wake up because I had this hole in my stomach! Trust me: The hunger pangs you get when you're pregnant are much different than when you're not. Experienced fitness competitors can go to bed hungry, wake up hungry, eat, and be fine. A pregnant woman can't go to bed hungry. I was scared that I would wake up and puke! The only times I threw up during my first trimester where when I went three hours without eating, in fact. I had to eat to feel comfortable, to even get to sleep.During the day, it felt like I was training for a marathon. I found myself eating hourly, sneaking in bites of something calorie-rich between client sessions to get me through. If I missed a window, I became nauseous and had a hard time focusing on work. But here's the big takeaway: The couple of weeks when I did eat like crapola, I didn't beat myself up for it. I've spent the last eight years cleaning up my nutrition and supplementation, so I was confident this was just a phase. And sure enough, when Week 10 hit, I wanted chicken and vegetables again. Thank God! Vitamins and SupplementsI'll be honest: I cut out most of my prepregnancy supplement stack after consulting with my midwife and nutritionist. But I also had my blood work done and discovered that there were a few areas I could still benefit from a little extra help with. Nicole's Prenatal SupplementsCod liver oilPrenatal vitamins CholineCalciumVitamin BVitamin DFor instance, my vitamin D was off the bottom of the charts. I supplemented with calcium and vitamin B and went on a whole-food prenatal vitamin made by New Chapter. I also took extra choline, since this nutrient is crucial for baby's development, particularly in the brain and central nervous system. I usually alternate between omega-3 capsules and liquid fish oil such as cod liver oil, which is more concentrated. I kept this up during my entire pregnancy, and I also tried to eat quality wild-caught fish that I felt confident was low in mercury. A little calcium and B-vitamins, and I was set!About the Weight Gain... In the first trimester I gained about 6-8 pounds. It's kind of amazing that's all I gained, considering how much I ate. But honestly, I wasn't freaking out about my weight. I knew I needed healthy weight to have a baby with healthy weight. I totally understand how people in this industry may freak out about weight gain, but I committed to enjoying the journey. This was my first pregnancy, and I wanted to experience it in all its bizarre, intense glory! I didn't think I could get pregnant, so it was a blessing from day one. I enjoyed learning more about my body, and I want everyone to know that even after all that we've learned about pregnancy, it's still a lot of trial and error.I took control where I could, but gave it up where it felt necessary. That's a life lesson we can all benefit from, pregnant or not!"

Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide - Part Two!
It still amazes me that there is a human growing inside of me. Since the last time I wrote I have found out that I am having a boy and I am thrilled. I am now 27 weeks pregnant and just beginning my third trimester. I will outline what I have been doing.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pregnancy1.htm,"Note: This is part two, click here for part one!  It still amazes me that there is a human growing inside of me. When you first get pregnant it takes a while for it to sink in and it is amazing to me how one being that I have not even met yet means so much to me. I am so attached already that I can not imagine what it will be like when I actually get to see him.  I realize now how important staying in shape is and how important it is to eat right. I hope that all of your pregnancies are going well and these articles have helped. Since the last time I wrote I have found out that I am having a boy and I am thrilled.  I grew up with all girls so it will definitely be something different! My first trimester was so slow for me but the second was so fast. I am now 27 weeks pregnant and just beginning my third trimester. I will outline what I have been doing and how you need to adapt to your ever changing body.   Exercise    Exercise wise I have been doing the same lifting plan as the first article. I still go light so there has been no problems for me there. Cardio has gotten a little harder for me and I have had to change my routine up a little. I used to do 45 minutes at a time and now I have cut it back to 30 minutes at a time.  With the 30 minutes I do one more day so I can still get some good cardio in. Remember your joints and ligaments are very loose now so injury can come a lot more easily. Just remember to take it slow and make sure you can carry on a conversation throughout your whole session.   Supplements    Supplement wise I am still the same also. The fish oil is the most important right now so if you have not been taking that I would get some right away.  It can really help the baby sleep through the night and improve his smarts! Calcium is being drained from you at a fast rate now so make sure you do not skimp on your calcium pills.  Your body can only absorb 500mg at a time so you will need to split up your doses. Your morning sickness should be over by now and so there is no excuse not to take your pre natals. If you have a problem with them making you sick try and split them up. I take one in the morning and the other one at night!   Diet    Weight gain can come more rapidly now and foods can be stored as fat a lot easier. I feel like it is all being stored as fat. =)  Just make sure you eat a balanced meal and eat small meals often. One thing that can help is by taking a little bit of protein with each meal. It helps digestion and that is so slow right now anything helps. Since digestion is so slow, heartburn can be a real problem.  Drinking lots of water can help this and TUMS is also okay to take. One thing that I like to do is get the ones with calcium so that way I make sure to get all the calcium I need!   Conclusion    This last leg of the pregnancy can really bring you down so you will want to do everything you can to make yourself feel better. The baby, I know mine like it, may use your ribs as punching bag and seem to sit on your bladder 24/7.  Your fatigue comes back now and so can morning sickness a little. Also the dreaded varicose veins can come in - YUCK! But exercise is the number one thing to prevent this. Exercise, diet and eating right can make this not so bad.

What do you think that's done for you?My life has not been a walk in the park. Not having key people in my life, like parents or a spouse, has made things a bit challenging. But, I feel that it's truly helped me grow as a person and athlete. I can function and do anything alone. I have no problems finishing things that I set my heart and mind to.Why did you enlist in the Marines?I enlisted in the USMC because at the time I did not have any sort of structure in my life. My older brother was an active-duty Marine and I saw how it was providing him choices and security that I didn't have.Looking back at the time I spent in the Marine Corps, there's no question that it provided me with lessons I will hold close for the rest of my life. Responsibilities an 18-year-old Marine has are far beyond those of what many people would have in a lifetime.Do you prefer performance fitness to physique fitness? What do you say to people who are more concerned about how they look than how they perform?My whole life has depended on how well I did things. I always had to perform or make things happen in my life just to survive. I played sports my whole life and I always wanted to be better than the day before. I would practice and drill the mechanics of the position or game I was training for.I started doing figure purely because of the results of the training I was doing. Once training became secondary and how I looked became the most important, I decided that figure was no longer my interest. I needed a competitive sport to fill the void.I really have no opinion for those who prefer to look strong and healthy rather than being strong and healthy. The only thing I would say from one fitness professional to another would be: ""Be honest with what you do to look a certain way. There are people who look up to you and, if you are setting unreachable goals, it can very much discourage them.""What are your goals for CrossFit?My CrossFit goals are to be the fittest me I can possibly be. I will be turning 30 in 10 months and plan to be in the best physical shape possible. I did the Open WODs and it was a great way to see where I was and how I compared to other athletes. I have a new plan and am working really hard to make it to Regionals next year.I will be competing at the Garage Games in Virginia Beach in August. I will also be running a half marathon soon and hope to run the Marine Corps Marathon in October.  // <![CDATA[var addthis_config = {data_use_flash: false}// ]]>"

Bodybuilding Can Decrease Your Risk Of Developing Type 2 Diabetes!
Type 2 diabetes doesn't appear overnight.  It takes time for it to develop which means you have time to take the necessary measures to halt its development in its tracks. Learn more.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/decrease_type_2_diabetes_risk.htm,"Article Summary: Type 2 diabetes has some controllable risk factors and others you can't. Physical activity and healthy diet are great measures to decrease risk. Decreasing your stress levels is recommended for decreasing your risk.  Bodybuilding Can Decrease Your Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes  Type 2 Diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Formerly known as Adult Onset Diabetes, type 2 diabetes typically strikes during adulthood. Though it used to be very uncommon for children to develop type 2 diabetes, our nation is seeing an alarming increase in the number of children who are being diagnosed with this disease. This rise, in both children and adults, coincides with the rise in obesity over the past several years.  Click To Enlarge.This Rise Coincides With The Rise In Obesity Over The Past Several Years. In type 2 diabetes, our body's cells become resistant to the hormone insulin which shuttles glucose (sugar) into our cells. When our body is resistant to insulin, and in the absence of medication, our blood sugar levels stay elevated. Over time, high blood sugar causes a number of complications including heart disease, kidney disease, eye problems, nerve damage, skin problems and circulation issues.   Causes   The most important thing to know is that type 2 diabetes is often preventable. Though some people have an increased propensity for developing this disease, if they take the proper measures, they can increase their chances of preventing it from ever occurring. Type 2 diabetes doesn't appear overnight. It takes time for it to develop which means you have time to take the necessary measures to halt its development in its tracks.   var title = ""Awesome Muscles Podcast Series""; //The title of the radio showvar URL = ""http://bodybuilding.com/fun/audio/am/awesome_muscles_podcast_29dec2005_3.mp3""; //The URL to the audio file (can be any type of audio file)var pictures = new Array();var pictureslinks = new Array(); pictures.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/images/2009/decrease_type_2_diabetes_risk_a.jpg""); //A URL to a picture to go on the rightpictureslinks.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/diabetespodcast.htm""); //A URL to the link of the picture on the right (if no link, leave bank or &quot;null&quot;) pictures.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/images/2009/decrease_type_2_diabetes_risk_b.jpg"");pictureslinks.push(""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/gastelu.htm""); audioPlayer(URL,title,pictures,pictureslinks);   There are many contributing factors that can lead to the development of  type 2 diabetes. These include:   Excess Fat    Excess body fat, especially abdominal fat will increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The more fat you have packed on your body, the more your cells become resistant to   insulin.    In addition, the type of fat you eat and the size of your cells alters your cell membranes which house the receptor sites that insulin binds to. This would be like cutting a larger keyhole and expecting the same key (insulin) to open the door.  Inactivity    Physical activity helps control your weight and it uses up glucose in your bloodstream for energy so your body doesn't have to pump out as much insulin to bring that glucose into your cells.

As a bodybuilder you have this one covered. In fact, you are doing more than the minimum amount of exercise recommended to help decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You periodize your training to meet your goals and consistently challenge your body through strength training and aerobics.  3.

Stay In The Game With Kinesiology Tape
Today's top athletes sport more than just striations and badass tats on their skin; they're also covered in brightly colored strips of kinesiology tape. Here's what you need to know to tape like the pros!
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/stay-in-the-game-with-kinesiology-tape.html,"Back in 2008 during the Summer Olympic Games, people who tuned in to the beach volleyball competition noticed something a little strange. What was that funny-looking colored tape that some of the athletes were wearing? What's in a name? The original Kinesio Tape was invented over 30 years ago in Japan by chiropractor Dr. Kenzo Kase. Today, there are several brands offering variations under the more general title of ""kinesiology tape,"" including the popular brands KT Tape and RockTape. Kinesiology is the scientific study of human movement. In this spirit, kinesiology taping allows much greater movement than more rigid traditional sports taping procedures.Sports care providers and elite athletes could have told you that what you were looking at was called kinesiology tape. They had been using it for decades, but almost no one else had. In the last few years, though, taping has definitely come down the mountain. Today, it's an increasingly common sight not only in team sports, but also in more general weight training, running, and cycling. You can buy high-quality tape in almost any sporting goods store or online, and you don't need to have a pro help you apply it. Sons can effectively tape up their dad's golfer's elbow before a weekend tourney. Friends tape each other's lower legs to help with shin splints or calf pain prior to running a 5k. CrossFit athletes apply the tape on their abs and lower backs during training and competitionbut so do pregnant women during the third trimester.Greatbut does it work? In my experience as a chiropractor who deals with plenty of athletes, it definitely does. The tape helps speed up the healing process while supporting injured tissues. It also allows athletes to train with minor muscle injuries while the healing process continues. If that sounds like what you need to stay off the sidelines, here's what you should know. WHAT DOES KINESIOLOGY TAPE DO?KT Tape: Elastic Sports Tape Doesn't Restrict Your Range of Motion, Comfortable to Wear! Get It Now!Kinesiology tape is designed to mimic human skin. When placed on a body part, it helps facilitate the body's natural healing process by lifting the skin away from the muscle fascia, creating space between the blood, lymph, and nerves. This improves circulation and reduces pressure on sensory and neural receptors, which reduces pain. This method of taping allows more movement than traditional athletic taping for injuries, which is more compressive and limits joint movement. Depending on who you ask, the benefits of kinesiology tape differ slightly. But overall, these are the main benefits people experience:Muscle and joint support to encourage correct movement and limit compensation due to injury.Pain relief through improved blood circulation and lymph drainage.Increased sensory stimulation through the skin, which can alleviate muscle weakness and reduce muscle pain.The most common injuries that can benefit from taping are wear-and-tear phenomena like strains, overuse injuries, and ligament pain. For more advanced injuries, start by meeting with a qualified health care provider and building a treatment program that is based on a personal examination and history. Once the injury has improved and proper instruction on taping has been given, you can try home taping.  When placed on a body part, kinesiology tape helps facilitate the body's natural healing process by lifting the skin away from the muscle fascia, creating space between the blood, lymph, and nerves. KNOW YOUR STRIPSA little bit of education goes a long way when it comes to kinesiology taping. Don't just slap a strip on and expect it to work for you. Specific applications and technique will differ according to what area you're treating and your desired goal. Start out by getting proficient with your tape provider's preferred technique. Once you've mastered the basics, you can experiment with some of the more complex arrangements you see on CrossFitters and other athletes. No matter the technique, though, it always starts with you making the base or anchor of the tape. This is achieved by tearing the backing so approximately two inches of tape is exposed. Place the two-inch portion down on the skin and rub the non-sticky side to help activate the adhesive.Don't place any stretch or tension on the base. From there, remove the rest of the backing and maneuver the rest of the tape into one of these four basic styles of application.I-StripI-stripUsing an I-strip is a good application for muscle injuries. Simply apply the strip directly over the muscle belly with minimal stretch. I also like to place a smaller strip perpendicular to the first strip lying directly over the injured area for additional support. Y-StripY-stripA Y-strip surrounds a muscle by using its two tails for support. It is commonly used on the calf, triceps, and shoulders, among other applications. Some tape companies sell pre-cut Y-strips, but you can easily make one by cutting down the middle of an I-strip. Once the base is laid down with no tension, apply the tails to or alongside a muscle. The tension on the tails should be equal. I use this applications a lot for neck and shoulder problems. X-StripX-stripYou can make an X-strip either by overlapping two strips or cutting a single strip. I like to use this application at the elbow, knee, and other delicate areas where having multiple points of support is helpful. When working around joints, try to keep equal tension on the tails.Fan StripFan stripThis application is used primarily for reducing edema, or swelling. It consists of a base with 4-5 thin strips. Depending on the body part, the strips are usually placed about a half-inch to an inch apart. A second strip can be place on the opposite side of the first base, and the strips can be placed in an overlapping fashion. This further helps with edema reduction. Athletes use fan strips all over the body, but some common applications include sprained ankles, plantar fasciitis, and on the abs or shoulders.These are just the start. If you watch the numerous instructional videos put out by tape manufacturers, you'll see all of these styles mixed in complex tape patterns. Mastering them will take practice, and often, a patient partner to learn with you. If you fear that you're not up to the task, seek out an experienced sports therapist or chiropractor in your area.8 RULES FOR EFFECTIVE KINESIOLOGY TAPINGCommon Questions Do the different colors have different benefits? No, aside from looking cool.  Does the tape have any medication on it? No.  Will it work for my painful [fill in the blank]? Maybe. Do research, experiment, and talk with your provider.    1   Buy the right tape for youTape can be purchased in two-inch rolls similar to standard athletic tape, and sometimes a four-inch strip for larger areas like the low back. If you're a trainer or coach who will use a lot of tape, you could invest in a range of tape precut into X, Y, and fan formations. The rest of us can simply cut I-strips into the shape we need. Each supplier has different varieties of tape to choose from.   2   Prep your skinI say this because I have sometimes not prepped the skin properly, and the tape didn't adhere firmly or came off too soon. Make sure the area of the skin to be treated is dry and free of oils, creams, and lotions. Also make sure that there is not excessive body hair. Applying tape to a hairy area will interfere with the adhesion. Get a trimmer and shave the area if necessary.   3   Tape stretch and tension are crucialMost applications require a certain amount of tension be placed on the tapetypically 0, 25, 50, or 100 percent. An easy way to understand this concept is to start by stretching the tape to maximum lengththat's 100 percent. If you back it down halfway, that's 50 percent, and another half-step down is 25 percent. Placing the tape on the body without stretch would be called no stretch or ""paper-off"" tension. Tension can also be achieved by stretching the body part, then taping it in the stretched position. All of these techniques have their uses, and sometimes a guide will have you mix them in a single application.   4   Rub to make it stickYou're not done once the tape is on the skin. You also need to gently rub the tape along its surface a few times. This will help activate the adhesive to the skin.    5   Keep it dry at firstEvery kinesiology tape I have ever used was water-resistant. That means the tape should stay on while bathing or swimming. However, with so many brands flooding the market, there might be one or two that aren't as resilient as the top brands.Just check the labels and there should be no problem. I recommend that my patients keep the tape dry for at least 30-45 minutes after application to let the adhesive set.    6   Don't put heat on the tapeWhether it's a heating pad, hot pack, or dryer, keep it off of your kinesiology tape. Heat will increase the adhesion of the tape and make it hard to remove. I once had a patient have her low-back tape become melted on simply due to a heated car seat. On the other hand, applying ice is fine, and I recommend icing for injuries accompanied by acute swelling.   7   Don't rush to reapplyKinesiology tape isn't like a bandage that needs to be replaced daily. In general, a taping application should last 3-5 days. Some higher-end tapes can last for weeks, but I've also seen them come off in a couple of days from poor application. It depends on skin prep, activity levels, and patient care.   8   Be gentle with tape removalDon't just rip it off, which can cause skin irritation. Pick one corner or end free with one hand, and then press your free hand on the tape. Slide the pressure down the tape as you pull behind it. You can also make tape come off more easily by removing it in the shower or applying baby oil. REFERENCES Stanton, T. (2012, November 1). Athletes Believe in ItShould You?

Toney Freeman (1st place at 2007 Ironman)      Last year,  Toney Freeman was the favorite going into this contest after coming in 6th in 2006. However, the issue for him at the Olympia was that he was off the mark: He was smooth. Many argue that he can well afford to add a lot more mass to his 6'2"" frame. He was just off his peak this time around, and hopefully he knows what to do to make it better.   Click Image To Enlarge.Toney Freeman - 2007 IFBB Iron Man Pro.

Phil Heath (Didn't Compete Last Year)     In his pro debut year,  Phil ""The Gift"" Heath, won both the  2006 New York Pro and the  Colorado Pro.

Eddie Abbew (3rd, 2007 Iron Man):   This is Eddie's 9th year on the pro circuit, but you couldn't tell from the way he looks! He always comes in as one of the best conditioned athletes on stage. It's been said that the British athletes are often overlooked, but I don't think any of the judges can miss ""Nice Guy"" Eddie this time around.  Click To Enlarge.Eddie Abbew - 2007 IFBB Olympia. He's had to work extremely hard for every 'top ten' placing he's achieved, which are few and far between. Last year, he was in the first call-out with Toney Freeman and Mark Dugdale; here's hoping we get to see a repeat performance of that night. He's monstrous, but cut; massive, but striated; gi-normous, but ripped. No matter what country you're from, that is a winning combination.   2007 Iron Man - Eddie Abbew   Windows Media (11.0 MB)   8. Desmond Miller (Didn't Compete Last Year):   ""The New York Giant"" beat out Evan Centopani in the 2006 NPC Nations to get his pro-card. He subsequently competed only twice in 2007, placing 4th at the New York Pro, and 2nd at the Keystone Pro in May. He's taken 9 months off during which time, I hope, he's figured out how to control his waist (it almost overpowered his lats at the NY Pro), and another little upper body ""problem""...

Assuming he made the necessary improvements since the Keystone, Desmond will definitely break the top ten.   9. Will Harris (Didn't Compete Last Year)  ""World"" Harris is to back, like Branch Warren is to legs, like Arnold is to chest, like Sergio is to abs. He's got it! The question remains, can he bring his other body parts up to par, to match his ""World-wide"" back? He took a year off in 2006 to work on his lagging body parts, and started 2007 with a bang by coming in 2nd at the Europa Supershow.  Click To Enlarge.Will Harris - 2007 IFBB Olympia. However, his luck quickly ran out, as he placed 15th at this year's Olympia. Hopefully ""Big Will"" has been training hard and tweaking his diet to bring back the Will of Old -- the combination of size, symmetry and leanness that almost beat Silvio Samuel.   10. Troy Alves (Didn't Compete Last Year):  I don't have much to say about our friend, Mr. Alves. He took most of 2007 off, except for two shows where he placed 6th and 10th respectively, in order to gain much needed size, depth and width.  Click To Enlarge.Troy Alves. I placed him in my line-up because I have blind-faith that if he brings the same conditioned package we've come to expect, but with at least 20 more pounds of lean beef, he will rock this show.

Bryna's Pregnancy Fitness Guide!
It is very important for me to stay fit and active during the pregnancy for my baby as well as myself. If you would like to learn more please read on to get my tips and ideas on staying fit during this trying time.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pregnancy.htm,"Note: This is part one, click here for part two!  Society puts such an importance on being fit and looking good it can be a little overwhelming. When you actually achieve that ""look"" you will do anything to hang on to it. Well, when the time comes when you start thinking that a family would be nice you also have to come to grips with the fact that your beautiful flat stomach will be a thing of the past, at least for a while.  I know that pregnancy is a beautiful thing and a growing stomach is something that is both beautiful and worthy of showing off but getting to that point is the hard part. I am now going through this process. I am 4 months pregnant, and other than a couple breakdowns when my clothes didn't fit, I am coming to the point where I am accepting my body and I am excited to see my belly grow.  Pictures from my first fitness contest. So many women think that when you get pregnant it is time to put your feet up and relax. You do need to do that sometimes, but it is also very important to stay fit and active. When I got pregnant I knew it was important to stay in shape but I wasn't sure if you follow your normal fitness program, lessen it, or do something special. When I went to go look on the Internet I found that there is just about zero out there.  It is very important for me to stay fit and active during my pregnancy for my baby, but for me also. Since there is not a lot out there I would like to take you through what I have learned and what I am doing so when the time comes for you, or if you are there, you will not be as lost as I was.   Supplements   When I decided that children were what I wanted I immediately started to take folic acid. This is very important in helping decrease the chance of serious birth defects. It is said that 70% of women know about folic acid but only 30% actually take it. It is very important to take it before, during and after pregnancy. A pre-natal multi-vitamin s also important to make sure that your body has the vitamins and minerals that you and your baby need.  One great multi-vitamin that has plenty of folic acid is Twinlab Pre-Natal. It has the correct amount of vitamins you need and it won't make you sick. That is definately a plus since most women feel sick during this time anyway.  It has been said that men who take folic acid before conception have stronger sperm and their baby has a smaller chance of something being wrong, genetic wise. Twinlab also makes their Daily One Caps with folic acid and that is what my husband took for about a year before we got pregnant.  Pregnant women also need about 60% more protein. You need that protein to make a healthy and beautiful baby. I know there can be a lot of bad tasting protein powders out there but it does not have to be that way. A couple to check out are Optimum Any Whey and Syntrax Nectar protein. The Any Whey is tasteless and so you can do anything you want with it. I sometimes put it in yogurt or my oatmeal. You really don't even know that it is there but you get high quality whey protein! The Nectar is great if you need a change. It comes in cool flavors like Cherry Berry (just like cherry kool-aid), Apple Ecstasy (just like a green jolly rancher) and Caribbean Cool (if you like alcohol you would swear it was the real thing). If you just can't stand to drink it there are always protein bars. A popular bar is the Detour Bars.  More and more has been coming out about fish oil and its benefits to your baby's brain development. Studies have shown that fish oils can help form the brain and when taken in the third trimester and after birth it can actually help improve your child's smarts! Who knows if you take your fish oils you may have the next Einstein! There are a lot of fish oil capsules out there that can make you burp all day and who wants to smell that? The one that I have had the best luck with is Health From the Sun High Potency Fish Oil. Whatever supplement you choose, be sure that it has DHA in it.  Calcium is of course very important. So many people have a deficiency even if they are not pregnant. All of the baby's bones need calcium so it will take it from you. If you are short on calcium then you are left with mere scraps. Your gums can begin to bleed and your bones can become weak. Later on in the pregnancy your back can actually hurt worse because of the lack of calcium. So remember to take that everyday. Even pre-natal vitamins do not contain 100% of your daily calcium so you will need something extra. Most dairy products contain a lot of calcium and you can also get it from broccoli, baked beans and some nuts.   Diet   Of all the things you may crave during pregnancy, remember you are not actually eating for two like many binging pregnant women say. You actually only need 300 extra calories a day! Also, you are not even eating for the baby until 18 weeks. Before that the baby just takes what it needs from your body, even if you do not eat much at all. Make sure you do eat your vitamins, protein and calcium so you do not become depleted. Sometimes it is hard to eat during the first trimester because your body is so full of hormones but that is okay. You can live off of crackers and Sprite and your baby will be fine.  There are also certain foods you want to stay away from that can harm your baby. There have not been a lot of studies on this but one sweetener you want to stay away from is saccharin. Animal studies show an increase in cancer in offspring. Not something I would want to chance. All of the others seem to be okay but you should limit it to 1-2 servings per day.  You will want to avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, shell fish and tilefish because it has such a high level of mercury per serving. This can pose a risk to the child's developing nervous system. Canned tuna is okay once a week but fresh tuna has too much mercury also. Grouper, Amberjack and mahi mahi have a high level of toxins so you should stay way from them too. There are still plenty of fish that are good to eat such as salmon, sea bass, haddock, halibut, cod, sole, flounder, perch and farm raised trout. Remember those fish oils are good for the baby's brain.  You should try and stay away from foods that are preserved with nitrates. You can check the label to be sure. Some examples are hot dogs, salami and lunch meat. Stay away from soft cheeses like brie, feta, and blue-veined cheeses. There is a chance of listeria. You should stay away from uncooked eggs, pate and under cooked meats because there is a chance of salmonella. It is also said that too much soy can slow down the development of the sex organs in boys. Until I find out what sex my baby is, I am done with soy! Make sure when you eat fruit and vegetables you wash them very well. You, as well as you baby, do not want the pesticides that can be left on the food.  No matter what you eat you will probably get bloated and get gas. Your intestines have slowed everything down to ensure that the baby gets the vitamins it needs. Just make sure to eat slow.  Another thing to remember is to floss! You have a higher risk of gum disease and that can lead to preeclampsia and preterm labor. Get a dental checkup and cleaning as soon as you can.   Preventing Morning Sickness    There are some things you can do to prevent the dreaded morning sickness. Be sure to drink lots of water... you need this anyway because it helps replace the amniotic fluid for your baby. Exercising can help as well. Make sure you eat right and get plenty of sleep. If you are unable to sleep the whole night you should take short naps through out the day. Being tired can make you even more nauseous.   Things You Should Immediately Stop Doing   One thing you need to do right now is quit smoking. It is very harmful to the baby. If you smoke, it will live it's first 9 months in a smoke filled womb, cough violently and it may hinder the babies growth. It is also believed that smoking can cause your baby to be more susceptible to cot death. Also, alcohol is another big no-no. More and more studies have shown that alcohol is very harmful to a baby. When you take a drink so does the baby. Just think if it takes you, an adult, three drinks to get tipsy, your baby is on the verge of passing out he is so drunk. It also can increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects when the baby is born. So no, you can't have just one drink. You are obviously not a virgin anymore, but your drinks should be.  Caffeine is not a good idea either. The same idea as the alcohol is there. Caffeine keeps you going and gets your system moving. Just think of the effects those stimulants have on your tiny unborn baby. His heartbeat is 150-180 beats per minute as it is so you do not want it any higher! Studies have shown that there is an increase of stillbirth with too much caffeine. Most doctors agree that a little caffeine each day, like only one cup of coffee, probably won't hurt your baby... but why even chance it?  Average weight gain is 25-30 pounds. It is said that only 38% of women gain what they are supposed to. Women who eat a high fat diet while pregnant may increase the risk of the child developing heart problems later in life. If you gain too much weight it can cause problems like diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia in you and all of this can lead to overly large babies. I am not sure about you but I prefer not to push out a 10lb baby. If you are overweight you also have a higher risk of cesarean delivery and studies have shown that you might also have a problem with lactating.  Also, and this is just as bad, if you gain too much weight during pregnancy it can take up to 2 years of hard work just to get it off. Many women don't realize that gaining too much weight during pregnancy can cause health problems for the mom and the baby for the rest of their lives. It helps you and your baby be healthy if you can stay in this range.   Working Out: Cardio And Lifting Weights   Of all the things that can help, one of the major things is working out. You can be pregnant and still workout. Here are some guidelines to be safe and healthy. When you do cardio, just make sure that you are not so out of breath that you can't carry on a conversation. If you used to run you should go to fast walking. You do not want to do anything that is really jarring to your body. The stair stepper is great... just make sure that if someone came up to you, you could talk to them no problem. Also, when you are working out make sure you do not overheat. If you are hot, so is your baby. Drinks lots of water and try and workout indoors if at all possible. Lifting weights doesn't have to be abandoned either. You shouldn't be trying to go for any new personal lifting records but you don't have to stick to the 5 pound dumbbells either. The rule of thumb is to make sure you can carry on a conversation. If you are in the middle of bicep curls make sure you can talk to someone with no problem. Never go to muscular failure on your reps. If you need a workout here is the one that I am doing. It is a basic program and it works great.

I try and make it to the gym twice a week for weights. I used to go to the gym three times a week but I am waiting for some of my energy to come back. Going to the gym twice a week will still give you great benefits and muscle tone. I also do cardio 4-6 times per week for 45 minutes. I just get on my treadmill and read a book. Once I get into a book the time flies for me. You do not have to do this as long or as much as I do but try and at least do cardio 3 times per week. Your body is pumping more blood through your body and you will want as healthy heart as you can get.  So why should you keep working out? Working out has shown to lower the risk of problems with the child, lower risk of cesarean and lower risk of diabetes. It has also shown that exercise during the first and second trimester help reduce the risk of premature birth. Keeping your legs and lower back muscles in shape can help prevent back pain later in pregnancy. Also, staying in shape can make it much easier for you to lose your pregnancy weight after your baby is born and get back on track with your normal fitness program.  Another exercise that is important is the Kegel exercises. You do them by pretending you have to go to the bathroom and squeezing your opening shut and then relaxing. You will want to do 50 ""reps"" per day. This strengthens your pelvic floor and can help with bladder control during and after pregnancy. One really good benefit is that the stronger your pelvic wall, the better the orgasm. Enough for me! Remember if you experience any of these during exercise stop immediately and contact your doctor:  Contact Your Doctor If These Symptoms Appear: Pain, especially in your back or pelvic region Excessive tiredness Dizziness Shortness of breath Feeling Faint Vaginal bleeding Difficulty walking Contractions Remember if you work out, even if you do not feel like it, it will help you get some energy. I know that even when I feel like I do not want to get on the treadmill, once I am done I feel so much better and have more energy than before I started!  The whole point of following the advice in this article is to have a healthy baby, a healthy body, and a safe and easy pregnancy. It will help you lose the weight and help the baby now and later on in life. Everything that I have talked about I am doing. I have had barely any morning sickness and the couple of bouts I did have I never threw up. I am tired a lot but I find that if I get on the treadmill it helps me wake up. My appetite has been great and I do sometimes crave the sour things like dill pickles and pickled eggs. Acne can be a side effect of pregnancy but so far with a healthy diet and exercise that has not been a problem for me. I have only gained 5 pounds so far. I am starting to get a little pooch and I love it. I can't wait to look pregnant and get to buy all the cute maternity clothes.  I hope that this has helped you and if you any questions you can email me at Bryna@bodybuilders.com. I will be checking in every month to let you know how it is going and what is going on in the pregnancy and I will give tips on what you need to be doing next.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/simone4.htm,"Note: This is part two, click here for part 1! click here for part 3!  Month One & Two: The very first month was by far the easiest so far. Then again, the first two weeks of what doctors consider ""pregnancy,"" conception hasn't yet taken place. The next month following I continued to feel quite un-pregnant and my fitness regimen went on just as normal and smoothly as it has the past few years.  During my sixth week of pregnancy I began to loose energy and strength, nausea began to set in and boy did things begin to change then. I continued to work out, but workouts were a struggle to get through and two sessions quickly became one. My eating habits began to plummet as rice cakes and multigrain saltines became my best friends. It was all I could do to keep from feeling nauseous and light headed. By week nine I would spend my lunch hour sleeping in the car instead of going to the gym. I was exhausted, but not without hope.  Month Three: I had my first OB appointment on the first day of my ninth week. I had plenty of questions for him and hoped that he would be able to provide me with insight on how to boost my energy and tame my nausea. The good news was he could tell that I was a healthy individual and there was a light at the end of the tunnel. He said that the second trimester is usually much better. The bad news was there wasn't anything that I wasn't already trying that would help me get through the morning sickness any better. Cutting back on carbs and increasing protein would help my energy, but I would still need to do what I could to help control the nausea and yes, that means that complex carbs would continue to be my best friend for a while longer.  My OB and I also talked about my vitamins and nutrition as well as my fitness routine. Although I was taking a multi-vitamin daily, he prescribed a pre-natal vitamin that contained everything my growing baby would need over the next nine months. I later questioned him about the absence of electrolytes in the pre-natal vitamins and he told me that I could continue to receive these additional nutrients from Gatorade if I so desired. The most important thing that my doctor told me was that pregnancy is not an illness and not to treat it that way.  He told me that I can do everything that I'm used to doing in my daily routine with the exception of alcohol and illicit drugs. I was even shocked to find out that I would be able to do my normal ab work out. My OB said that I would get to a point when my belly was too big and I would be too uncomfortable to do certain movements, but until then I should keep on keepin' on.  Tips: Listen to your body. Rest when you are tired and don't feel guilty for missing a work out! Don't use pregnancy as an excuse to eat whatever you want, but if you are having trouble with nausea or keeping foods down, Remember... eating foods that are not necessarily considered to be the healthiest of foods is much better than not eating anything at all. Your baby needs to be fed and that is the most important thing at this point in time!  Keep in mind all things should be done in moderation. Freeze Gatorade for a slushy treat. This also is good for those times when nothing else, even liquids won't stay down. Protein Shakes are a good way to continue to get nutrients even when solid proteins tend to not sit well on the stomach. Please feel free to contact me at Simone@Simone6i.com with any questions.

",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/staying_healthy_while_pregnant.htm,"Staying Healthy While Pregnant  Making the decision to have a baby is one of the biggest decisions a woman will make in her lifetime. Those who are heavily involved with their workouts are sometimes a little tentative to make this decision because they know that it's a long nine months where they will have to be adapting their current workout regime and then can be a long time after getting back to their pre-baby weight, depending on the individual situation.  Some new mothers regain their pre-baby body very quickly, while for others, those last few pregnancy pounds just don't want to seem to leave.  To any woman who's put in a lot of time and effort getting to and maintaining a lower body fat level, this almost always does cause some degree of anxiety.  Click Image To Enlarge.Making The Decision To Have A Baby Is One Of TheBiggest Decisions A Woman Will Make In Her Lifetime. Because of this, it's important to learn what you can do in terms of your workouts during pregnancy and the best methods to stay healthy while pregnant, not only for yourself, but for your unborn child. Here are the big points you need to know about staying healthy while pregnant.  Benefits Of Exercising During Pregnancy   Many years ago, women were actually advised to stay away from exercise entirely during pregnancy, but now things have changed and most are encouraged to participate in some form of exercise on a regular basis.  First off, participating in exercise will help you feel better as the body will be moving around, keeping the blood circulating to the various tissues. This goes a long way to help out with cramping that may occur when pregnant, as well as helping to boost your overall energy levels.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Pregnancy: Staying Fit!   Are you pregnant and not sure about healthy weight gain? You can stay fit during this time by using the following nutrition and training guidelines.   Author: Melissa Johnsen  Staying active can also help to reduce the occurrence of headaches, backaches (provided exercise is performed properly), and helps to reduce joint soreness since the more active your joints stay, the more active the lubricating fluid within the joint will be.  Since exercise does burn calories as well, keeping active can help keep the pregnancy weight gain at bay, however note that you should never exercise with the purpose of losing weight while pregnant, unless you are at a very heavy weight to start with and have your doctor's recommendation to try and shed a few pounds.  Your body needs the extra calories at this point for the baby's development, so you must not short yourself - the exercise will simply help to prevent too much additional fat gain.  FORUM THREAD[ Click To Join The Thread. ]  Pregnant & Working Out.   I recently losta lot of weight and now I'm really starting to miss working out. I've been told that I can do cardio but only walking and at low speeds.   Started By: Stoofinoof  Not to mention that staying active while pregnant will make getting back into your workouts after pregnancy that much easier.  Exercise Guidelines During Pregnancy   Heart Rate Issues:     One of the oldest  myths about exercising while pregnant was that you should keep your  heart rate at 130 beats per minute or lower. You were instructed that if it went higher with this, you should back down immediately.   Now this is changing and it is seen to be safe to work out a little harder. A better guideline to use is a rate of perceived exertion. This is also better because different women will have naturally different heart rates when performing exercise.  Related Heart Rate Articles:  Measuring Your Heart Rate For Fitness. - By Lisa Moser How To Calculate Your Heart Rate! - By Matt Danielsson Heart Matters: Are You Training Your Heart? - By Jeremy Likness Other Heart Rate Articles...  For example, one woman working at one pace may find her heart speeds to 120 beats per minute, while another one equally as fit might find it speeds to 140 beats per minute. This a genetic variation that needs to be accounted for.  So instead, try and keep your rate of perceived exertion somewhere around the five to seven mark during the early stages of pregnancy and four to six mark closer to when you're due (on a scale of one to ten).   Abdominal Exercises - Yes Or No?     When pregnant, many women worry about performing any type of  abdominal exercises for fear it may crush their baby.   While you definitely don't want to lie right on your stomach during pregnancy, you can safely still perform many abdominal exercises.  During the first trimester some light crunches can still be performed, however after this time as you move into your second trimester, avoid any exercises that you perform lying on your back.  Click Image To Enlarge.Crunches.Video Guide: Windows Media - MPEG - Video iPod  Good options at this point would include simple  stomach contractions (tightening and holding it), standing pelvic tilts, or some gentle  knee raises while hanging from a padded standing ab machine.   Being Aware Of High Intensity Lifting Movements:     While pregnant, one thing you will want to avoid so you stay healthy and safe with your workouts is very intense weight lifting exercises that will require strong muscle contractions.   When pregnant, the body will release a hormone that is designed to naturally help relax the joint tissues, so this will counteract what you are aiming to do, setting you up for injury. The big exercises to avoid are squats, lunges, one leg split squats, push-ups, and the bench press.  RELATED ARTICLE[ Click here to learn more. ]  Training & Pregnancy!   After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries.    Author: David Robson   All of these are using the major joints and if the joints are too loose, you'll really struggle.   Paying Attention To Balance:     You'll also want to focus on your balancing abilities while pregnant as often these are impacted quite heavily. Avoid performing too many exercises that do require precise balance, so as to prevent falling over and suffering an injury to you or the baby.  Click Image To Enlarge.Author, Shannon Clark: ""Avoid PerformingToo Many Exercises That Require Precise Balance.""  Know When To Stop:     While you definitely should keep up your exercise program, it's vital that you do learn to recognize the warning signs that are telling you to stop.   In the past you may have forced yourself to just push through the pain, but now that you're pregnant this is not a smart move. Signals that you need to back off the exercise include feeling dizzy, lightheaded, having pain anywhere near the abdominal region, suffering spotting, or feeling nauseous.

Weight Training & Pregnancy!
After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries. This article will provide guidelines on pre-natal exercise and other health considerations.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/drobson10.htm,"What might be the benefits of weight training, and other forms of exercise, in the months leading up to childbirth? This was a question asked of me by my wife recently.  She is pregnant and like most women wants to ensure the good health of both herself and the baby she is carrying. This prompted me to research the area of pre-natal exercising. I found that it is beneficial to exercise while pregnant for a number of reasons.  Indeed, those who exercise while pregnant enjoy many advantages over their non-exercising counterparts.  These include: Fewer problems experienced during childbirth  Enhanced post natal recovery  Lower incidence of backaches and less severe headaches  Enhanced body image  Feelings of wellbeing and happiness, and a positive self image  Increased energy levels  Increased flexibility  Increased aerobic capacity  Better circulation of blood to the extremities  Greater muscle strength and coordination, which helps with adjusting to increased bodyweight and changes in balance.  Pregnancy-related constipation avoidance Although these benefits can be realised through exercise, certain guidelines do need to be followed. A pregnant woman is quite vulnerable and precautions need to be taken to ensure that certain exercise stresses do not have a deleterious impact.  After all, pre natal exercise should be directed toward muscle strengthening to minimize the risk of joint and ligament injuries. This article will provide guidelines on pre-natal exercise and other health considerations.  As a woman undergoes her special metamorphosis, as the pregnancy draws near, exercising might prove to be most beneficial in assisting overall pre-natal health and a successful birth.  The Why & How Of Pre-Natal Exercise?   The changes associated with pregnancy can cause a multitude of problems for the child-bearer. Many of these problems are related to a weakened musculature as a result of inactivity coupled with the additional stress placed upon the body as a result of pregnancy related weight gain.  Exercise in general, and weight training in particular, can strengthen supporting muscles and lessen the back pain and overall muscle and joint weakness associated with pregnancy. The best exercises are ones that do not cause strain.  In particular, avoid any exercise that involves lying on the front, as this will place pressure on the abdomen and cause pain. Instead, exercises should focus on the muscle groups that undergo pregnancy related stress.  The following exercises, with their corresponding body parts, are advised: Dumbbell bench presses for the pectorals.  Dumbbell shrugs for the trapezius.  Bent over shoulder laterals for rear deltoids and rhomboids.  Hyperextensions for lower back.  Hip abductors (outer thigh) and adductors (inner thigh) for hip and pelvic region. Exercise ball crunches and for the abbs: training abbs while pregnant can be problematic as the inferior vena cava is compressed when the back is in a flat position.  It is better to execute the crunch on an exercise ball in a supine (facing up) inclined position. The back muscles also benefit from this particular exercise through increased strength and flexibility. Hip abductor/abductor and abb work also play a part in reducing lordosis of the spine.  As the fetus grows, the abdominal muscles are stretched and weakened and this causes the lower back muscles to shorten. Additional stretching of the hip-flexor muscles will prevent exacerbating the lordotic condition.  Exercise ball squats for quadriceps: hormonal (relaxin) increases result in softer connective tissue surrounding the joints, so try to refrain from deep knee flexion and, instead, concentrate on the upper part of the movement.  The exercise ball makes an excellent substitute for a regular bar squat and is a much safer option. The regular squat forces the wrist into a flexed position and this causes numbness and tingling in someone who is pregnant. The oedema (tissue swelling) associated with pregnancy causes compression of the median nerve in the wrist and when the wrist is flexed these symptoms occur.  Light weights should be used for all exercises to prevent any unnecessary stresses or strains. The rational for using these exercises exclusively, as part of the weight training component of an exercise routine, is they focus primarily on the areas that tend to weaken the most due to pregnancy.  The extra weight of the breasts during pregnancy tends to pull the shoulders forward shortening the pectoral muscles and overstretching and weakening the rhomboid and trapezium muscles in the back (Kyphosis).  During the preceding exercises one should therefore try to really stretch the muscles being worked. Also, worth noting is the value of moderation. It is best not too train to hard for too long as this may cause additional stress and negate the session's benefits.    Three full-body sessions per week, provided weights are light and motivation is high will be sufficient.  Although this article, strictly speaking, is about the benefits of weight training for the pregnant woman, it is worth mentioning the value of aerobics.  Aerobic training will assist the weight training sessions as it would in a regular exercise regime. Waste product removal, fat loss and enhanced cardiovascular function are three benefits to be gained from aerobic work. A 20-30 minute walk three to four times per week should be sufficient.  Guidelines & Precautions   Now that the exercises and training recommendations have been determined, certain guidelines need to be followed.  In response to a pregnancy a woman will undergo a series of changes that may impact exercise safety. Probably the most significant of these changes are cardiovascular.  During pregnancy, blood volume increases approximately 40% and the more blood that has to be circulated the faster the heart has to beat to complete this job. Heart rate and cardiac output increase as a result. Dizziness may also occur as a result of the additional pressure placed on the large veins in the back region that take blood back to the heart from the lower extremities.  This can have implications when training, and, as such, it is advised not to engage in work that involves lying on the back and elevating the legs.  In terms of cardiac output, it is best to monitor exercise intensity and keep track of heart rate. Heart rate should not exceed 140 beats per minute for longer than one minute as this could result in increased cardiac output and fatigue. Follow all exercise with at least ten minutes of cool down work to restore heart rate.  Metabolism and hormonal changes also occur during pregnancy. A woman's core temperature will rise as a result of an increased metabolic rate and this could have serious consequences in terms of foetal health.  A significantly elevated body temperature can cause foetal damage making this particular problem precarious to say the least. The most vulnerable period is the first trimester (the first four weeks). To counter any potential problems drink plenty of water before, during and after training, avoid exercise in hot humid environments and stop often during the session to stabilise temperature.  The hormonal changes specifically revolve around the hormones estrogen, progesterone, relaxin and elastin. Connective tissues and joints are softened and relaxed in preparation for childbirth, dur to the interplay of these hormones, making a pregnant woman more susceptible to injury.  To counter these problems never overextend or engage in deep flexion of any type, warm up for longer than usual and avoid high-impact exercise that requires jarring, jumping or forceful movements.  In addition to pregnancy related changes and their considerations, one should also be mindful of the following. Do not hold breath but continually breath throughout. In general, exhale on exertion.  Drink plenty of fluid before during and after training to prevent dehydration.  Check for abdominal muscle separation weekly. During pregnancy hormones cause the centre seam in the abdominal muscles to soften and stretch as the baby grows and the abdomen expands.  Ab training, as explained, should help to prevent separation but if it does the following can be done to correct it: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands on your abdomen with your fingertips pointing down toward your pubic bone. Exhale as you slowly lift your head and shoulders while pressing down and in with your fingers - that will encourage the abbs to reconnect.  Activities which require coordination and precise balance should be avoided. Increased weight, softening and increased mobility of joints and ligaments, and shifting centre of gravity may alter ones ability to coordinate muscles.  Muscles should be appropriately stretched before and throughout training.  It might be wise to reduce energy output as pregnancy progresses. A larger energy output will be required as more weight is gained and fatigue will occur more readily.  And most important of all: consult with your physician before undertaking any training program as there might be certain contraindications that only a qualified physician can identify. Dietary Considerations   During pregnancy blood sugar levels typically drop quite significantly. Blood sugar levels will also fluctuate. In addition, noradrenaline (a hormone responsible for sending blood sugar into cells to be utilised) will be released during exercise.  The blood stream becomes dramatically low in blood sugar as a result of this and the aforementioned pregnancy related blood sugar lowering.  A pregnant exerciser who trains too hard for too long may feel dizzy and lose concentration as the brain uses only blood glucose (sugar) for energy. This could result in injury or worse. To avoid these consequences: eat about two servings of a high complex carbohydrate food (rice or potato for example) between 60 to 90 minutes prior to training.  During training, and indeed, pregnancy, correct nutrition is paramount. Folic acid will help to maintain overall health in general and reduce the possibility of neural tube defects (spina bifida and anencephaly) in particular. 400 micrograms per day is recommended.  Folic acid is a member of the B-complex family of vitamins and can be found, naturally occurring in green leafy vegetables, legumes and dried beans. Certain breakfast cereals contain sufficient folic acid. Folic acid can also be consumed in supplement form or easier digestion and convenience.  Conclusion   Pregnancy is a special time, belied by the turmoil that takes place in a woman's body. Hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and blood sugar changes create an environment where additional care needs to be taken, in particular when it comes to exercising.  Rather than stop completely and forgo the wonderful benefits of exercise, it is best to continue on, using the modifications suggested in this article. An expectant mother can enhance her transformation while maintaining her beauty and grace through exercise.

So You're Pregnant:  Now What?
It is the time many women wait for all their lives.  The time when they are going to produce a life of their own.  Some people will spend years trying to become pregnant, hoping and praying. Here is some advice to staying healthy during this time.
",http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sclark17.htm,"It is the time many women wait for all their lives. The time when they are going to produce a life of their own. Some people will spend years trying to become pregnant, hoping and praying, but when it finally happens, have no idea what to do with their workouts. Some women view pregnancy as a time when they can relax and eat to their hearts content using it as an excuse for getting out of shape. These people forget however that they will have to deal with the consequences of their actions after the baby is born.  How many times have we heard one women say to another, ""It's a amazing how fast she managed to loose her baby weight... I had my baby 3 years ago and I still can't seem to loose the last bit of mine"".  Instead of giving yourself the green light to the 9 month long buffet that many women embark on, vow to keep up with your exercise regime as much as possible, nourish your body with proper foods so that both you and your baby will be healthier after you give birth, and use exercise as a chance to reconnect and prepare yourself for the changes in your life that are to come.   Exercise Still A Possibility   During your pregnancy, your fitness goals will change to more of a maintenance state rather than an improve performance state. You can still complete both aerobic and strength training, however various modifications and restrictions will be in place.   Aerobic Exercise     With regards to aerobic exercise, the newly pregnant women should choose an exercise that she enjoys and that is not too strenuous on the body. Make sure the exercise will not risk your balance because any sort of fall could cause trauma to the growing baby.   You also need to choose a moderate form of exercise as a drastic increase in core body temperature is thought to be harmful to the fetus by increasing the risk of congenital anomalies and shifting the blood to skeletal muscles rather than the baby.  Good examples of cardiovascular exercise to include are walking, either on a flat surface or on a slight incline (for those who are already in advanced cardiovascular shape - note: during pregnancy you should not try to increase the intensity of your workouts at all), swimming, or stationary biking.  If you begin to feel breathless at all during your workout you should stop immediately until it has passed and then if you feel well enough continue, but do so at a reduced intensity.  Here is a reference chart for target heart rate ranges during pregnancy:  Maternal AgeHeart Rate Target (beats/min)Heart Rate Target Zone (beats/min)Less than 20 140-15523-2620-29 135-15022-2530-39 130-14521-2440 or greater 125-140 20-23  Calculate Your Maximum HR Calculator Here...  Strength Training   Strength training is also important to continue into pregnancy. By continuing with your routine you will help keep your muscles strong, which will make everyday activities easier (since you will now be carrying additional weight due to your baby), and will also help keep your bones strong throughout and after your pregnancy.   Women who perform strength exercises for their pelvic muscles also decrease the risk of urinary incontinence which can occur during and after pregnancy.  Choose Type Of Exercise Carefully:     The choice of strength training exercises to include is important to consider. No exercises should be done where the woman is laying on her stomach (such as   laying hamstring curls, back raises, etc) as this will put extreme stress on the baby.    Also, after 20 weeks of pregnancy, it is advised that you don't do any exercises on your back either, as the added weight of the baby can interfere with blood circulation.  You also want to refrain from using very heavy weights as these will place a great deal of stress on the body and the recovery systems which should not be compromised as this may affect the health of your baby.  Seated Exercises Are Good Choices: seated rows seated bicep curls overhead tricep extensions leg extensions sitting hamstring curls lateral pull-downs seated chest presses  As with aerobic training, pregnancy is not the time to decide you want to sprout new muscles, it's a time to maintain and preserve your current strength.  Therefore, take care to use sensible weights, reps and rest periods as to keep your workouts stimulating but also comfortable at the same time.   Yoga    Another great option for pregnant women is yoga. Obviously you don't want to be twisting into odd pretzel shapes during this time, but simple yoga moves that focus on proper breathing and body control will give you the benefit of stress relief, enhanced flexibility and a general sense of calm and collectiveness.   These days, many gyms offer prenatal yoga classes that are specifically designed with pregnant women in mind.  An additional consideration with regards to exercise during pregnancy is that some women may find that they wish to refrain from exercising during the first trimester until the nausea and fatigue have passed.  Yoga: Tips And Exercises For Pregnancy.   Yoga has been used for centuries to help center a person and relieve stress. In many countries, yoga for pregnancy is considered the only option.

Learn More About Yoga Here...After Baby Arrives Finally, once the baby is born and healthy, it is important to ensure you are fully recovered from the process of childbirth before restarting exercise once again. When you are feeling good enough to work out, start off slowly, as you did when you first became pregnant and gradually work your way back up to the intensity levels you were at prior to your pregnancy.  Realize that you will not be able to regain your prior fitness level overnight, so if you were running 5 miles a day before don't go out and try those same 5 mile runs right away, or you'll just end up home, sore and unable to take care of your newborn baby.  Have patience with yourself and enjoy your workouts with the journey back into fitness. Take care of your nutrition and remember you can't loose all your baby weight right away, but with good planning and assuming you stayed relatively fit and gained the minimal recommended amount of weight, you'll be back to your shape in no time!

[ Click here to learn more. ]  Also remember that you now have a baby in your life, which is going to be very time consuming and demanding, may not wait patiently while you finish your workouts. You may have to reduce your workout frequency and duration because you will be spending much more time looking after your child. This is perfectly understandable so just tell yourself that once you get a chance you will once again commit to your old exercise regime.  While it is important to be aware of the risk associated with exercises during pregnancy and how to avoid them, also consider the risks of not exercising.  These include loss of muscle mass, loss of cardiovascular fitness level, increased chance of weight gain, the development of sleeping problems and lower back pain, varicose veins, and increased psychological stress levels.  By keeping your body in shape, you will also help keep your mind in shape and will better prepare yourself for the journey you are about to take with your new baby.

I've been a competitive figure athlete for the past 7 years, turning pro in 2007, but I was not always in this good shape. In fact, during my pregnancy, I gained almost 45 lbs!

Exercise during pregnancy should focus on maintaining the health of mom, and strengthening her for ease of the delivery process, rather than specifically focused on the cosmetic benefits of exercise.  It's also important to keep in mind that pregnant women and breast-feeding moms have increased calorie needs.

Choose instead, lower impact activities, such as running only on level terrain, walk-running, or using swimming, cycling, treadmill walking or low-impact step mill climbing. Exercise with longer, but with less intense bouts than your non-pregnant friends. (According to the ISSA recommendations, a pregnant woman should exercise at up to 50% of her maximal oxygen uptake, as opposed to 60% for non-pregnant women.) Resistance exercises are generally safe to perform, as long as consideration is given for the changes in the physical shape of the woman during pregnancy. Resistance exercises should be performed in a stable posture, seated is preferred. Supine exercises should be avoided after the first trimester. Vigorous or high-intensity exercise training, or exercising to exhaustion, should be avoided. Keep intensity levels moderate. Stay well-hydrated and well nourished!

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/prenatal-probiotics-paving-way-healthy-baby/,"Eczema is becoming a fairly common problem in young children. This condition is characterized by frequent outbreaks of reddened, inflamed skin with significant itching. But beyond the discomfort, it is now recognized that when children are diagnosed with eczema, they have a much greater risk of other immune issues, like persistent inflammation of the nose and eyes, as well as full-blown asthma.Its now become clear that the level of inflammation in the human body is determined, to a significant degree, but the health and diversity of the bacteria living in the gut. In fact, an astounding 70% of the immune cells in our bodies are clustered around the intestines!So its no surprise that researchers have begun looking at ways to modify the gut bacteria in children in hopes of balancing inflammation and the immune system, specifically as this relates to eczema.Scientists in Finland recently tried to determine if probiotics, given to pregnant women, might reduce the chance of their babies developing eczema. Women were selected if they themselves had allergies, as this increases the chances that their babies will develop eczema. The study involved several hundred women, half of whom were given a probiotic during their last two months of pregnancy, as well as during the first two months of breastfeeding. The other group received a placebo.The results of the study were dramatic. The risk of developing eczema in the probiotic group was an astounding 70% lower than the placebo group, with the authors concluding:Maternal probiotic supplementation during the last 2 months of pregnancy and the first 2 months of breastfeeding significantly reduced the risk of developing eczema in high-risk infants in this study. Note that the probiotics were administered exclusively to the mothers, whereas the infants did not receive probiotics.This is exciting news. Simply modifying the mothers gut bacteria with the use of prenatal and postnatal probiotics imparted profound protection on the newborn, in terms of a healthy immune system. These findings, as well as others now being reported, are opening the door for us to embrace the value of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy, as well as during breastfeeding, not just for a healthy mother, but for babys health as well.Read NextPsoriasis  A Gut Related DisorderModern medicine is clearly vestedin what I like to call the Las Vegas mentality.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/pesticide-zika-carrying-mosquitos-lesser-two-evils/,"War has been declared against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, carriers of the dreaded Zika virus. With some pretty solid evidence linking Zika to microcephaly, as well as Guillian-Barre syndrome, governments in affected countries are going all out as they attempt to reducemosquito populations.Predictions now anticipate that Zika virus will soon find its way into North America. So the images of trucks fogging neighborhoods in Brazil, that have become so common in the news as this problem worsens, may soon become real-life experiences for Americans in Florida and other southern states.One of the most commonly used classes of fogging agents to kill adult mosquitoes are the pyrethroids. Though there is a move now to embrace the idea of bringing DDT back into the game, pyrethroids remain pretty much the first line of defensewhen it comes to fogging infested neighborhoods and homes throughout the Americas.Pyrethroids are often depicted as being harmless, by virtue of the fact that they are synthetic analogues of an extract of chrysanthemum flowers (of all things), and what could possibly be wrong with that? As it turns out, theres much that warrants concern.First, heres what our own CDC has to say about their safety:Human health effects from pyrethroid pesticides at low environmental doses or at biomonitored levels from low environmental exposures are unknown.This statement isnt referring to an accidental exposure at a high concentration. Theyre telling us that even when considering a low level exposure, the health effects are unknown. Think about that next time you see images of homes being fogged.But heres whats even more concerning: In 2014, researchers at the UC-Davis published a study of 970 children living in Northern California, in which they explored possible environmental links to autism. The study looked at exposure of pregnant women to commonly used commercial pesticides by looking at how close they lived to farms spraying these chemicals during their pregnancy.The researchers specifically evaluated risk of autism in relation to exposure to pyrethroids, yes, the same pesticide now being used to carpet bomb Zika-carrying mosquitos. The study shows that exposure of mothers to pyrethroids during the third trimester of pregnancy was associated with an 87% increased risk of autism for their child.In the field of medicine, we are schooled to evaluate any intervention by considering its risk/benefit ratio. So far, it looks like the benefit employing pyrethroids with the hope of possibly getting a leg up on Zika virus infections is getting the mostattention. Prudence dictates that we consider potential risks as well following the dictum of above all, do no harm.Read NextThe Empowering Neurologist - David Perlmutter, MD and Dr. Michael CallahanDr. Michael Callahan is CEO and co-founder of the Zika Foundation.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/christopher-e/,"I really enjoyed Christophers story, and its one I think youll want to share with friends or family members who are hesitant to try out this lifestyle.  Dr. PerlmutterThought Id throw this out there because Ive managed to drastically improve my health with a few changes.I didnt start out unhealthy, but I had let myself get run down through a combination of work stress, physical stress, and poor nutrition. Im not an old guy and Ive always been able to get away with whatever I wanted to do, so why not work eighty hours a week, train to climb a mountain, and knock out the Bataan Death March all in a six month period, all while getting four hours of sleep a night and supplementing with lots of coffee! Shockingly, I started feeling super-fatigued every day a few weeks after the mountain climb, and then, to my surprise, my hair started falling out. Seriously, patches of hair started falling out! Being an Army Officer, I keep my hair short, but one day one of my sergeants said, Sir, whats going on with the back of your head? I checked it out and sure enough, I had a bald patch on the back of my head.Over the months, it kept getting worse, and the dermatologist said it was alopecia and that we might be able to treat the patches with steroid injections. Without that, Doc said they may get better or worse, but said the best thing I could do was limit stress. Yeah right. I got orders to change duty stations, and my wife told me that we were pregnant all in the same month. The patches kept getting worse over the months, and being a leader and a guy who works in healthcare, it certainly didnt help my leader presence or put patients at ease to see my patchy head.Fast forward eight months or so after moving and I picked up a copy of Grain Brain. Intrigued by the assertion that some nutritional supplements (gasp) were being touted by a Neurologist as being neuroprotective and restorative, along with the idea that the gut microbiome could impact not only brain but also just about every system in your body, I quickly read the entire book.Feeling and looking terrible, I went ahead and gave the ketogenic diet a shot and I began six of the seven supplements suggested in the book (minus the resveratrol). We had the baby the next month (Sep 2015), so my stress level and sleep got worse, but the patches magically started filling in. By January they were all gone, and I no longer feel like Im lifting a piano every time I get out of bed. Ive also lost 20 pounds.The success has inspired and empowered me, and now Im tackling my stress and sleep.  I recently began a daily meditation period this week (not sure if its doing anything but Im hopeful), writing a gratitude list, and Im trying to get seven hours of sleep every night. I seriously used to think this homeopathic stuff was laughable (was actually taught that it was garbage), but after my own personal case study (n=1), Im starting to come around.Read NextSandy C.What I like about Sandy's store is the role her husband's aunt played.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/something-think-next-time-shampoo-pet/,"Allow me to paint a mental picture for you. Its a beautiful spring day, and a handsome young couple is outside, laughing and smiling, garden hose in hand while they bathe their golden retriever. If you look closely, you might notice that the womanis actually pregnant. What an idyllic scene!But new research challenges the benignity of the event just described. Unbeknownst to our happy couple, the product themother-to-be is shampooing her dog in is actually creating a situation that is far from the care-free, happy portrayal wed like to embrace.Researchers at the UC-Davis have evaluated the possible relationship between exposure to anti-flea/anti-tick pet shampoos during pregnancy and risk for autism.The study evaluated children aged 2 to 5 years,and compared 333 children with autism spectrum disorder with 198 typically developing children. Specific diagnostic criteria were used to confirm that the children fulfilled the diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder.The childrens mothers were interviewed for 90 to 100 minutes, and during this interview they were asked about household usage ofpest control products, weed control products, insecticide sprays, and pet shampoos, from a period of 3months prior to conception to when thechild was 1 year old. This is known as theexposure time.Among the many findings of this study, one of the most compelling was the fact that mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder were twice as likely to report having shampooed their pets with anti-flea/anti-tick shampoo during the exposure time, in comparison to mothers of normallydeveloping children. Statistical analysis revealed that the active ingredient that correlated with these findings was pyrithrin,which has been on the market for the past 20 years.We dont know the actual cause of autism, but we do note with great concern that its incidence is rising, dramatically. Prevalence of autism, according to the CDC, is now estimated at one in 68 births with more than 3.5 million Americans living with an autism spectrum disorder. Since 2000, the prevalence of autism in the United States, in just children, has increased almost 120%, and thisincidence continues to grow.There is no specific treatment for autism. Yet, we are now seeing more and more information that makes it clear that lifestyle choices may be playing a significant role in determining risk for this disorder. It is for this reason that I continue to present this information to anyone who will listen.Read NextProbiotic Prevents ADHD and AutismRight now in America more than 6 million children carry a diagnosis of ADHD.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/lizzie-c/,"The story of Lizzie and her family, though long, is a must-read.  Dr. PerlmutterI have lived the past decade of my life in terrible fear of developing early on-set Alzheimers disease. I am 26 this year, and I am the 4th child in a family of five girls. When I was 12, my mom started to get what I now know as the classic signs of Alzheimers. She was only in her 40s. Unfortunately, she ate the low-fat, whole-grain diet that was and, still is, so popular. Within a year of noticing symptoms, my mom had to go live in an assisted living home. No doctors knew what was wrong with her and many said she had Huntingtons Disease, although she tested negative for it. Three years after her first symptoms, she passed away. About five years later her sister also passed away from the same thing. My grandmotheralso had the same symptoms and died very young. They all had very stressful marriages.My sisters and I have always been terrified of getting sick like our mother. In recent years we learned that her illness was early on-set Alzheimers. It was helpful to know the cause, but inside we all felt full of despair, as if a death sentence had been placed on us. It has affected all of our life choices, even the choice to have children and pass on this gene.My sisters and I have always tried to eat healthy, and we all have a wicked sweet tooth. We all suffer from inflammation-related problems from chronic migraines that have landed us in the hospital, to stomachaches and constant fatigue. None of this was bad enough to think we were not healthy however. We all look fit, and never thought we were doing the wrong thing for our bodies. As I sat and read Grain Brain the day of purchase, I was eating a bowl of Cheerios. I literally put down the spoon and never ate gluten again after that day. Finally, I had answers! It was one of the best feelings I have ever had in my life. I immediately called my sisters and got them to read Grain Brain. We all got on the diet and have been sticking to it for over one year.One of the quickest things I noticed was that the fatigue virtually went away overnight. I used to have to take a nap every weekend, and felt like I was wasting my time-off. Sometimes at work, I would drive my car to a nearby parking lot at lunch to lay in the backseat to sleep!Today, I have so much energy I want to run all over the place! So I did, and my husband thought I had lost my mind. During this year there were two times when I was not diligent about checking my meal at a restaurant, and immediately became sick and tired. My husband had to drive me home one of these times as I lay in the backseat sleeping off the meal. I have not had any migraines since changing to this lifestyle, and they used to put me in the hospital. I never get body rashes and eczema anymore. I could go on, but suffice to say I feel so great that I will never go back to my old way of eating. Three of my sisters lost weight and got super fit looking also. They didnt look as if they needed to lose weight, but it just showed how much our bodies loved this new lifestyle.Now we all check in on each other weekly to make sure we are still on top of our lifestyle. We are exercising, eating right, and living a stress-free lifestyle. Weve even added ina tonof fermented foods! A weight has been lifted off of us.My sister (the first of the 5) also got pregnant this year. Before this, none of us could commit to possibly having a child go though what we watched our mother go through. Now we feel in control, and that it is a choice to activate this terrible gene we may have been passed.-Lizzie C.Read NextJudy L.Outside of the wonderful story about a woman who took back control of her health, the fact that this information was shared between groups of people who wanted to help others is what makes the story Judy shares so compelling. - Dr. Perlmutter Every day I congratulate my sister inFebruary 13, 2014In ""Success""Lets End The Era of Diagnose and AdiosToday's post is from a close friend of Grain Brain, Max Lugavere. - Dr. Perlmutter My name is Max Lugavere and Im a filmmaker, currently in production on a feature-length, millennial-focused documentary exploring the impact of diet and lifestyle on brain health.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/eat/brain-maker-foods/,"Probiotic FoodsActive-Culture YogurtAn explosion of yogurt brands has taken over the dairy section lately, but you have to be careful about which brands to buy; many of themboth Greek and regularare loaded with added sugar, artificial sweeteners, and artificial flavors. Read your labels. For people sensitive to dairy, coconut yogurt is an excellent dairy-free way to work plenty of enzymes and probiotics into your diet. KefirThe name Kefir is derived from the Turkish word keyif which means feeling good after consumption. This fermented dairy product is very similar to yogurt. It is a unique combination of kefir grains (a combination of yeast and bacteria) and goats milk thats high in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Its also rich in antioxidants. For those who are sensitive to dairy or lactose intolerant, coconut kefir, a non-dairy version, is also delicious and equally beneficial.Kombucha TeaThis is a form of fermented black or green tea that has been used for centuries. Fizzy and often served chilled, its also believed to help increase energy, and may even help you lose weight. TempehMany people, especially vegetarians, eat tempeh as a substitute for meat. Tempeh is fermented soybeans and a complete protein, with all of the amino acids. Also a great source of vitamin B12, tempeh can be cooked or crumbled over salads. *Note: Not to be confused with unfermented soy. The fermentation process reducesthe levels of phytic acid in tempeh, making it a much better option. Overall, I am not a huge fan of any soy derived product. But for vegetarians, this is an option.KimchiA traditional Korean dish, this is a mixture of fermented vegetables and seasonings. Common ingredients include cabbage, brine, radish and spices such as ginger and chili pepper. In addition to providing beneficial bacteria, kimchi is also a great source of calcium, iron, beta-carotene, and vitamins A, C, B1, and B2. For some it may be a little toospicy, but its one of the best probiotic foods you can add to your diet if you can handle the heat. SauerkrautA german word, Sauerkraut translates to sour cabbage. Not only does this fermented cabbage fuel healthy gut bacteria but it contains choline, a chemical needed for the proper transmission of nerve impulses inthe brain and throughout the central nervous system. PicklesNo wonder many pregnant women crave pickles, among the most basic and beloved natural probiotic. For many, pickles can be your gateway food to other, more exotic fermented foods.Pickled fruits and vegetablesPickling fruits and veggies, such as carrot sticks, transforms the usual into the extraordinary. Whether you do this yourself or buy pickled produce, keep in mind that the probiotic benefits are only present in unpasteurized foods pickled in brine, not vinegar.Cultured condimentsBelieve it or not, you can create lacto-fermented mayonnaise, mustard, horseradish, hot sauce, relish, salsa, guacamole, salad dressing, and fruit chutney. Sour cream, while technically a fermented dairy product, tends to lose its probiotic power during processing. Some manufacturers, however, add live cultures at the end of the process; look for these brands. Fermented meat, fish, and eggsConsumed in may traditional fares, you can find some mouth-watering recipes from corned beef to pickled sardines and fermented hard-boiled eggs in the recipes section of Brain Maker.Prebiotic FoodsAcacia gum (or gum Arabic)To reap the benefits of Acacia gum, you can buy acacia powder and mix it with water. Just 1 tablespoon will give you 6 grams of insoluble prebiotic fiberthe kind of fiber the gut bugs love for their own nourishment.Raw chicory rootI use chicory root when cooking, as it is an excellent source of antioxidants, as well as a terrific system cleanser. Most of my chicory consumption comes viakimchi, as its an ingredient I use when making kimchi at home (and you can find the recipe in Brain Maker).Raw Jerusalem artichokeJerusalem artichoke, which you might know better as sunroot, is actually a species of sunflower loaded with nutrients and health benefits. Specifically, besides being a great prebiotic, Jerusalem artichoke is rich in potassium and iron. During the week, I enjoy Jerusalem artichoke in salads.Raw dandelion greensDandelion greens are a rich source of prebiotics. Buy a bunch of these greens for the week and add them to salads and vegetable dishes.Raw garlicThere are myriad health benefits to be derived from garlic, and the fact that raw garlic is packed with prebiotics is just one of them. Lots of recipes here on my website to help you sort out how to make sure you get some in every day.Raw or cooked onionJust like garlic, onions are another vegetable you might be consuming every day without realizing just how powerful it is for your health. In both raw and cooked form, onions carry a strong prebiotic load.Raw leekLeeks are a subtle way to add not just flavor, but nutrition to any meal you are making. Its a prebiotic powerhouse you can work into almost every dish.Raw asparagusOne of my favorite snack foods, or side dishes, is fermented spiced asparagus (another recipe you can find in Brain Maker).For other foods you should make a staple of your diet, check out this list of gluten-free foods."

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/making-sense-of-net-carbs/,"Now that the low-carbohydrate dietary recommendations have really taken hold, we are beginning to see quite a bit more information about nutritionlabeling that not only describes total carbohydrate content of a particular food, but also indicates net carbs.Depending on the type of food, there may, in fact, actually be a significant difference between these two numbers.So lets break it down as it is actually very straightforward.The term net carbs simply describes the number of grams of total carbohydrates in a portion of food minus the grams of fiber. Fiber, it turns out, is a form of carbohydrate, but is not a carbohydrate that has any effect on blood sugar or insulin response. Therefore, the idea of focusing on net carbs, meaning the carbs that are left over when the fiber is removed from the equation, does make a lot of sense because it is these residual carbohydrates that strongly influence blood sugar and, consequently, insulin response.Lets look at an example. One half cup of baby carrots contains approximately 6 grams of total carbohydrate. But there is a fair amount of fiber in whole carrots, amounting to about 2 or 3 grams in this case. So the net carbs would be about 3 or 4 grams.An important place where this understanding comes into play is in looking at, for example, fruit juices. A one cup serving of regular orange juice provides of 25.8 grams of total carbs and only 0.5 grams of fiber, so the net carbs are about 25.3 grams. Thats enough to have a significant effect on blood sugar and insulin response.Another way of looking at this calculation reveals that a larger difference between the total carbs and the net carbs is a good indication of the fiber content. The larger the difference, the better food.Read NextYou Can Lose the Weight - Four Simple StepsGo to the mall. See a movie. Look around next time youre in an airport.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/breastfeeding-mothers-take-dha/,"It is estimated that in America today more than 6 million of our school-aged children have been given a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder. Whats even more disturbing is the revelation that close to 70% of these children are taking potentially dangerous, mind-altering medications to help them pay attention.As it turns out, research shows that if mothers take even a low dosage of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA during the first few months of breastfeeding, there is a significant increase in the ability of their children to pay attention when they are examined as they enter school. Research shows that when children receive breast milk from mothers who were taking a single, 200mg capsule of DHA, attention scores were much better when compared to the children of non-supplemented mothers when attention tests were administered at age 5 years. Other studies have clearly confirmed that the level of DHA in breast milk increases as much as 2-fold following mothers supplementation.These findings lend further support for the understanding that supplementation of DHA is important not just during pregnancy, but while nursing as well.Read NextDHA Improves Sleep in ChildrenSleep disorders in the pediatric population are common, occurring in as much as30-40% of children.

Over the period from 8 to 18 years, sample members were assessed on a range of measures of cognitive and academic outcomes including measures of child intelligence quotient; teacher ratings of school performance; standardized tests of reading comprehension, mathematics, and scholastic ability; pass rates in school leaving examinations; and leaving school without qualifications.Results:Increasing duration of breastfeeding was associated with consistent and statistically significant increases in 1) intelligence quotient assessed at ages 8 and 9 years; 2) reading comprehension, mathematical ability, and scholastic ability assessed during the period from 10 to 13 years; 3) teacher ratings of reading and mathematics assessed at 8 and 12 years; and 4) higher levels of attainment in school leaving examinations. Children who were breastfed for greater than or equal to 8 months had mean test scores that were between 0.35 and 0.59 SD units higher than children who were bottle-fed.Mothers who elected to breastfeed tended to be older; better educated; from upper socioeconomic status families; were in a two-parent family; did not smoke during pregnancy; and experienced above average income and living standards. Additionally, rates of breastfeeding increased with increasing birth weight, and first-born children were more likely to be breastfed.Regression adjustment for maternal and other factors associated with breastfeeding reduced the associations between breastfeeding and cognitive or educational outcomes. Nonetheless, in 10 of the 12 models, fitted duration of breastfeeding remained a significant predictor of later cognitive or educational outcomes. After adjustment for confounding factors, children who were breastfed for greater than 8 months had mean test scores that were between 0.11 and 0.30 SD units higher than those not breastfed.Conclusions:It is concluded that breastfeeding is associated with small but detectable increases in child cognitive ability and educational achievement. These effects are 1) pervasive, being reflected in a range of measures including standardized tests, teacher ratings, and academic outcomes in high school; and 2) relatively long- lived, extending throughout childhood into young adult- hood.DateJanuary 1, 1998View study"

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/critical-role-early-life-decisions-creating-microbiome/,"In Brain Maker, I dedicated a lot of space toexploring how we initially form our microbiome, the collection of more than 100 trillion organisms that live within our intestines. Certainly early life experiences are critical in the creation of what is now a looked upon as representing a new organ within the human body. As you will recall, I talked about how important it is for children to be born through the vaginal birth canal, if that is not medically precluded, and, also, I emphasized how fundamentally critical it is that children breastfeed, from the perspective of creating the best, most health-preserving, microbiome possible.In a new report from researchers in Sweden, Dynamics and Stabilization of the Human Gut Microbiome During the First Year of Life, researchers evaluated gut microbiomes of 98 mothers and their infants during the first year of life.Their findings were really quite remarkable. There were dramatic differences noted in the microbiomes of children born vaginally versus those born by cesarean section. In addition, significant changes were seen in babies who were breastfed versus those who were bottle-fed. One of the main conclusions the authors reached was:Cessation of breast-feeding drives the maturation of the infant gut microbiome.The authors went on to state:We observed that most of the early colonizers are derived from the mother, and that in C-section infants vertical mother-infant transmission was less frequent for important intestinal microbes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, while sharing of bacteria from skin and mouth was increased, in line with an earlier study.And further:These studies and our results hint to the life-long effects of breast-feeding for the priming of the gut microbiome, with possible effects on metabolic and immune health that we are only beginning to understand.The authors revealed that the changes in the microbiome of infants that more reflect the microbiome of an adult are not a random process but is induced not by food choices, like when solid food is introduced, but by the cessation of breastfeeding. As mentioned above, they feel that these changes may actually have lifelong effects in terms of metabolism and immune function.This data supportsthe information and recommendations in Brain Maker, wherein Idescribe how method of birth, as well as early life nutritional choices, plays such an important role in terms of the developing microbiome and future health of a child.Read NextGut Bacteria Chart Our DestinyI have just finished reviewing what I believe is a seminal research article relating to the gut microbiome.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/inflammation-affects-developing-brain/,"I have posted several blogs relating the fundamental role of inflammation to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. Indeed, this is one of the central themes of Grain Brain.That said, weve also got to take a look at the role of inflammation in the developing brain because the same damaging effects of the chemical mediators of inflammation in the adult might well lead to issues in the delicate brains of infants and young children.In a new study just published in the journal BMC Pediatrics, researchers looked at several parameters in infants including the frequency of febrile illnesses, as well as blood markers of increased inflammation including IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-4 which is thought to indicate reduction of inflammation.What the authors discovered was dramatic. There was a significant direct relationship between higher levels of the inflammatory markers and risk for developmental issues. In addition, higher levels of IL-4, associated with lower levels of inflammation, correlated perfectly with reduced risk for developmental problems.Further, the authors found that: Every additional 10 days of fever was associated with a 1.9 decrease in language composite score and a 2.1 decrease in motor composite score.So the role of inflammation in brain health and function throws a wide net and does indeed prove of fundamental importance throughout the age continuum. As far as infant health is concerned, keeping inflammation down looks like an important goal. Inflammation is reduced when babies are health and have healthy immune systems. That means minimizing antibiotic exposure as much as possible, spacing immunizations so kids dont get a boatload at a single visit to the pediatrician, breastfeeding whenever possible, and doing the best you can to avoid caesarean section.For more information, order your copy of Grain Brain todayandjoin Dr. Perlmutters email list.Read NextDiabetes and Risk for Cognitive DeclineOne of the most important concepts described in Grain Brain focuses on the fundamental role of elevated blood sugar as it relates to brain degeneration.

This particularly concerns arachidonic acid (AA: 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: 22:6n-3), which are thought to play important roles in CNS development and function. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between motor function at 7 years of age and the levels of AA and DHA in umbilical venous plasma phospholipids, representing the prenatal availability of these fatty acids, and in plasma phospholipids sampled at age 7 years.Subjects/Methods:Motor function was assessed both quantitatively (the ability to perform a movement) and qualitatively (how the movement is performed) with the Maastricht Motor Test (MMT) in 306 children, born at term, at 7 years of age as part of a follow-up study.Results: Backward stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed a significant, positive relation between umbilical plasma DHA concentrations (but not plasma DHA levels at 7 years) and the MMT total and quality score, corrected for the covariables gender, cognitive performance, gestational age and age at measurement (partial b 14 0.13, P 14 0.01 and 0.14, P 14 0.01, respectively). The contributions of DHA and AA (both at birth and at 7 years of age) to quantitative movement scores were not significant. Conclusions:Our results suggest that prenatal DHA availability, which can be influenced by maternal dietary DHA intake during pregnancy, can have an effect on quality of movement in later life.DateDecember 19, 2007View study"

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/prevention-alzheimers/,"Theres so much in the news these days calling attention to the fact that diabetes is associated with a profoundly increased risk for developing Alzheimers disease. In fact, just watch my recent interview with Dr. Melissa Schilling on the subject.But theres an important point that is absolutely critical to understand. While it seems like a good idea for diabetic patients to take medication to control blood sugar, the research seems to indicate that diabetics taking these drugs do not improve their situation, in terms of lowering their risk for Alzheimers.To be clear, I am not saying that diabetics shouldnt take their blood sugar medications. But I am saying that this looks like this one very important issue, your risk of developing Alzheimers, is not improved by medications designed to help normalize blood sugar.Researchers, publishing in the journalPLOS ONE, followed more than 70,000 newly diagnosed adult diabetic patients over an 11-year span. Risk of developing Alzheimers, a disease for which there is no meaningful treatment, was increased by 76% in the diabetics compared to age-matched, non-diabetic controls.More to the point of my report, the authors found that the risk was not reduced when the subjects took medications for their diabetes, stating:The present study demonstrates an association between DM (diabetes mellitus) and future development of AD (Alzheimers disease), suggesting that DM could play an important role in determining future risk of AD occurrence. However, we found that use of hypoglycemic agents (diabetes medications) had no beneficial effects for preventing development of AD. Further therapeutic strategies should be investigated for the prevention of AD, such as preventing DM or improving DM treatment.Their last sentence is profound. They are clearly calling attention to the need to prevent diabetes as a way of preventing Alzheimers.The study revealed that female gender was also associated with increased risk of Alzheimers, to the tune of about 24%. Of course, you cant choose your birth gender. On the other hand, your lifestyle choices play a major role in determining whether you will join the ranks of Americans with diabetes, thus I applaud these researchers for their emphasis on prevention.Alzheimers is preventable, to a large degree, by favoring a diet that keeps blood sugar in check. Thats the message from Dr. Georgia Ede in a terrific piece just published in Psychology Today. What the Harvard-trained Dr. Ede has described follows, to the letter, the carb-lowering, sugar-eliminating, and fat-supportive recommendations that are central toGrain Brain.When Grain Brain was first published, the notion of food choices affecting brain health was greeted with a healthy degree of skepticism. After all, that was way back in 2013 when people pretty much lived their lives as they chose, hoping that medical science would soon develop magic cures for their various health issues.Now, 27 languages later, our recommendations are seeing welcomed validation with more and more research supporting prevention as our most important goal, and Im happy to report that The Grain Brain Whole Life Plan takes this goal to a new level by emphasizing how to incorporate this exciting research into your day-to-day lifestyle decisions in a way that will pave the way for health.Read NextIf You Want To Lower Your Risk For Parkinson's, Drop The CookieWe are hearing more and more about Parkinsons disease, Especially lately after the death of Robin Williams.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/asthma-epidemic-explained/,"So much has been written in scientific journals recently about how the loss of microbes in the gut, especially earlier in life, affects the immune system. For example, researcher Marsha Wills-Karp, at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, recently revealed how early life exposure to antibiotics is associated with a substantial increased risk for the development of asthma.Asthma has become an epidemic in America, affecting 1 in 12 Americans and totalingaround $60 billion in direct medical costs, as well as lost work and school days, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).When we are exposed to antibiotics, which may well be a necessary medical treatment, the intervention isnt really a targeted assault on a particular offending organism. Rather, these days doctors prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics that are effective in wiping out a vast array of organisms, well beyond the offending agent, and this may include some of the good guys as well.One of the important functions of the good bacteria, often called the probiotic organisms, is to naturally limit the overgrowth of potentially damaging bacterial species. Kill off the good guys, and the bad guys can move in. This is what we see, for instance, with clostridium difficile diarrhea. An antibiotic associated illness that kills around 30,000 Americans each year.Another well-described function of various helpful bacteria is to modulate the immune system. Knock down their numbers and the immune system gets wonky  much as we see in asthma.In fact,it is this mechanism that may explain a new report in the journal Science Translational Medicine in which researchers found that low or undetectable levels of four types of bacteria in children at 3 months closely predicted who would likely develop asthma, and even skin allergies, by the time they reached their first birthday. Likely the names of these organisms, Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium and Rothia, wont be familiar to most of you, but you may know that low levels of Faecalibacterium have been correlated with inflammatory bowel disease.The study confirms how important it is to protect the gut bacteria early in life. As Dr. Stuart Turvey, co-author of the report stated:What I think is important and not so surprising to pediatricians was how important the very early life is and our study emphasizes that in that first 100 days the structure of the gut microbiome seems to be very important in influencing the immune responses that cause or protect us from asthma.Read NextAntibiotics - Let's ReassessDr. Martin Blaser, author of the bookMissing Microbes, recently penned a thought-provoking editorial in the journalScience,titled,""Antibiotic use and its consequences for the normal microbiome"".

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/coffee-healthy-choice/,"It has been estimated that around 60% of Americans over the age of 18 report that they are regular coffee drinkers. No doubt what most motivates this consumption is the familiar and dependable lift that coffee provides.What may be less familiar to us consumers of this popular beverage is the ever-widening base of information that reveals some significant health benefits associated with this drink.According to the Harvard School of Public Health, coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced risk for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is characterized by elevation of blood sugar and that can have implications for any and all parts of the body. From my perspective as a neurologist, T2D is thought to actually double a persons risk for the development of Alzheimers disease (more on that in a moment).Harvard also reports that regular coffee consumption could lower the rate at which liver cancer progresses, may help prevent gallstones, is not harmful with respect to heart attacks or strokes, and may well be associated with a reduced risk of developing Parkinsons disease, a movement disorder now diagnosed in about half a million Americans.To be fair, there are some possible downsides. Women who are consuming high amounts of caffeine may be at increased risk for miscarriage or stillbirth, and caffeine can raise blood pressure and heart rate.Aside from reducing risk for T2D and its implications for dementia, there may well be other mechanisms at play with respect to coffees ability to protect the brain. Researchers presenting data at the Alzheimers Europe annual conference in Glasgow have studied the risk of developing dementia in a group of adults over a four year period. They found that those who consumed three to five cups of coffee per day had about a 20% less chance of developing dementia. Their research revealed that the brains of the coffee drinkers actually showed less development of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimers disease.Their conclusions focused on the role of chemicals in coffee called polyphenols, which function as protective antioxidants and are known to favorably impact the gut bacteria. Caffeine itself is known to have some direct and positive effects on the brain which may also play a role.Dr. Iva Holmerova, serves as vice chairman of Alzheimer Europe. She commented on the research stating:The findings presented in this report are very encouraging and help to develop our understanding of the role nutrition can play in protecting against Alzheimers Disease. Coffee is a very popular beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world, and Im pleased to know that moderate, lifelong consumption can have a beneficial effect on the development of Alzheimers Disease.Read NextArtificially Sweetened Drinks are Not a Healthy ChoiceMost people wouldnt be surprised to learn that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages would be associated with an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/learn/resources/probiotics-five-core-species/,"Its overwhelming how many probiotics are now available today, and the number of different combinations available as nutritional supplements at health food stores, and even added to foods, is growing. There are myriad different species of bacteria that make up the human microbiome, but science has identified some major players, and aggressively studied these in both animals and humans. As such,Ill focus on this core group of probiotic species.To make the task of finding and purchasing the right formulas as easy as possible, Ive simplified my recommendation to just 5 core species that are widely available: Lactobaccilus plantarum, Lactobaccilus acidophilus, Lactobaccilus brevis, Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium longum. Different strains provide different benefits, but these are the ones that will support your bodys biology by doing the very things weve been discussing since the beginning of the book when it comes to sustaining brain health.Lactobaccilus plantarum: Found in kimchi, sauerkraut, and other cultured vegetables, this bug is one of the most beneficial bacteria in your body. It survives in the stomach for a long time and performs many functions that help regulate immunity and control inflammation in the gut. It also helps fortify the gut lining, fending off potential invaders that might compromise the intestinal wall and sneak into the bloodstream. In fact, L. plantarums beneficial impact on the gut lining is perhaps its most important attribute, for it reduces gut permeability, thereby reducing the associated risks for leaky gutincluding an increased risk for virtually every brain disorder. Moreover, L. plantarum can quickly digest protein, and this has the ultimate effect of preventing food allergies and even treating such allergies when they arise. Its been shown in experimental animal studies to protect engineered mice from having clinical symptoms of multiple sclerosis and even reduce the inflammatory response typical of that condition. Finally, L. plantarum has anuncanny ability to absorb and maintain important nutrients such as brain-friendly omega- 3 fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. All of these actions make L. plantarum essential for fighting infection and taking control of any pathogenic bacteria.Lactobaccilus acidophilus: L. acidophilus is the darling of fermented dairy products, including yogurt. It keeps the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in check and in doing so, aids your immune system. In women, it helps to curb the growth of Candida albicans, a fungus that can cause yeast infections. L. acidophilus has also gained fame for its ability to help maintain cholesterol levels. In the small intestine, L. acidophilus produces many beneficial substances that combat pathogenic microbes, including acidolphilin, acidolin, bacteriocin, and lactocidin.Lactobaccilus brevis: Sauerkraut and pickles owe a lot of their benefits to this bug, which improves immune function by increasing cellular immunity and even enhancing killer T cell activity. Its so effective in combating vaginosis, a common bacterial infection of the vagina, that its added to pharmaceuticals used to treat it. L. brevis also acts to inhibit the effects of certain gut pathogens. Perhaps best of all, it has been shown to increase levels of that all-star brain growth hormone BDNF.Bifidobacterium lactis (also called B. animalis): Fermented milk products like yogurt contain this gem, which is well documented to have a powerful effect on preventing digestive ills and boosting immunity. Its also known to be helpful in knocking out food-born pathogens like salmonella, which causes diarrhea.Bifidobacterium longum: Just one of the 32 species that belong to the genus bifidobacterium, this is one of the first bugs that colonize our bodies at birth. It has been associated with improving lactose tolerance and preventing diarrhea, food allergies, and the proliferation of pathogens. Its also known to have antioxidant properties as well as the ability to scavenge free radicals. In laboratory mice, B. longum has been shown to reduce anxiety. Like L. acidophilus, B. longum also helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels."

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/gut-bacteria-chart-destiny/,"I have just finished reviewing what I believe is a seminal research article relating to the gut microbiome. The study, written by researchers in Sweden, is titledThe Gut Microbiotia Masters of Host Development and Physiology,and recently appeared in Nature Reviews Microbiology.If youve been following my blog, you are no doubt aware of my keen interest in the role of the gut bacteria, the human microbiome, in the context of how these organisms relate to disease processes. Further, my new book, Brain Maker: The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brainfor Life, is focused on exploring the underlying research that relates these bacteria to various processes that can then affect the brain, as well as the various lifestyle factors that can be modified to enhance the health of these bacteria, and therefore translate into a better environment for brain health.I can assure you, there is an abundance of research that is ongoing, exploring the powerful role of the microbiome in human illness. But what these researchers describe is the powerful relationship of the hundred trillion organisms that live within us in terms of our normal bodily function and even with the development of our organ systems.They eloquently describe how the human microbiome first appears, meaning how we first colonize our gut by passage through the birth canal, and how these bacteria then pave the way for future colonization with healthy bacteria moving forward.They then explore various modifiable factors that dramatically affect the gut bacteria and are associated with alterations of our physiology. They included a discussion of antibiotics, exercise and other lifestyle issues, diet, and even our obsession with hygiene.The body of the article is certainly quite in-depth and scientific. But what is so striking is how the authors pursue the relationship of the microbiome not just to various medical conditions, but more importantly, in the actual production of human organs, the development of our immune systems, the function of our gastrointestinal systems, and a variety of other physiologic functions that really arent generally associated as yet with the bacteria that living within us.As they state:Research over the past decade has accumulated a large body of evidence linking alterations in the gut microbial composition to several diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, arthritis, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, it is now clear that the normal intestinal microbiota also influences numerous physiological aspects in the healthy host, including organ morphogenesis, immune system and gastrointestinal tract development and maturation, intestinal vascularization, tissue regeneration, carcinogenesis, bone homeostasis, metabolism and behaviour.This dramatically raises the importance of our understanding of the microbiome. Basically, this information is breathtaking and clearly serves as a harbinger for defining where science is going to take us in the future.We live in a time when science is making great progress in developing cures for various illnesses. Unfortunately, at the same time, we are seen issues like Alzheimers disease and autism virtually exploding on the scene with no meaningful understanding about what can be done.As these authors so clearly point out, the changes that are happening to the microbiome may well be associated with these and other unexplained diseases. They make it clear that we are modifying a fundamental control point in our most basic level of physiology. But rather then curse the darkness, lighting the single candle of hope should be what is taken away from this report. That is, we can change so many factors over which we have control to gain a more healthy, robust microbiome. This will no doubt enhance our chances of becoming more disease resistant, and in living a longer and healthier life.Read NextYour Health Depends on Your Gut BacteriaAs we watch Americas waistline continue to expand, and along with it the perpetual increase in diseases associated with this increased incidence of obesity, its really important to identify potential causes associated with this issue.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/probiotic-prevents-adhd-autism/,"Right now in America more than 6 million children carry a diagnosis of ADHD. I think it is fair to say that autism has become an epidemic when you consider that, today, as many as 1 in 40 male births will ultimately be diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum.So aside from hoping that effective treatments will be developed, theres no question that we have to wonder what may be causing these issues, and if that can be determined, what can be done to fix the problem. One thing that has been clearly supported in research is a relationship between what goes on in the gut and the development of neuropsychiatric disorders like these mentioned here. Bowel issues are common in ADHD and are seen almost universally in autistic children.Certainly, front and center in research these days is the understanding that the gut bacteria, part of the human microbiome, plays a huge role in terms of brain health and function. As such, researchers in Finland decided to explore the possibility that changing the microbiome might be associated with a reduced risk for both ADHD and autism.Their study, published just last month in the journal Pediatric Research, evaluated 75 infants who were randomized to either receive a specific probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, or a placebo during the first six months of life. The study then followed these kids for the next 13 years.At age 13 years, ADHD, or autistic spectrum, was diagnosed in 17.1% of the children in the placebo group and none in the group receiving the probiotic.The conclusion of the study humbly stated:probiotic supplementation early in life may reduce the risk of neuropsychiatric disorder development later in childhoodThis is quite a study. The researchers were able to demonstrate that just receiving one specific species of a probiotic virtually eliminated the development of either ADHD or autistic spectrum in those children receiving this intervention. I would agree that further study is necessary, but even this preliminary study demonstrates the profound potential moving forward for actual medical utilization of a probiotic regimen to prevent a brain disorder.Keep in mind that this study was begun 14 years ago at time when researchers were just beginning to get a taste of the importance of gut bacteria as they relate to the brain.For more information,order your copy of Brain Makertodayandjoin Dr. Perlmutters email list.Read NextADHD - Thinking Beyond the BrainAs is so often the case, Americans want to reach for pharmaceutical fixes for our various maladies, and so it is with ADHD.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/artificial-sweeteners-threaten-health/,"It seems self evident that consumption of sugar sweetened beverages would be associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). And in fact, this has been demonstrated in multiple studies. This is understandable when you consider what a powerful slug of fructose is delivered by each can or bottle of this stuff.So it is that the term, sugar free is being exploited to death by soft drink manufacturers because of the mistaken public perception that choosing artificially sweetened drinks would be a healthier choice. It is a mistaken perception as now were seeing studies that have demonstrated that the risk for T2D is also dramatically increased in individuals who choose not to drink sugar sweetened beverages, but opt for those that contain artificial sweeteners.In a recent report in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, French researchers evaluated more than 66,000 women over a 14 year period and found that those who favored sugar sweetened beverages did in fact have an increased risk of T2D, by about 34%. Incredibly, those choosing artificially sweetened drinks had a risk increase for T2D that was more than twice what that amount.In trying to explain this seemingly paradoxical finding, the authors speculated that artificially sweetened beverages, because they dont cause the body to secrete insulin, may therefore not stimulate the satiety response. This lack of appetite suppression may ultimately lead to increased calorie consumption in the form of other foods.But now, other researchers may have identified a different mechanism relating consumption of artificial sweeteners and diabetes. Israeli researchers recently demonstrated that in both laboratory animals as well as humans, glucose intolerance (which sets the stage for full blown diabetes) is related to changes in the gut bacteria induced by artificial sweeteners. Consumption of these chemicals induces changes to themicrobiome, the collection of microbes and their genetic material that live within our bodies.Keep in mind that it is the microbiome that helps regulate all manner of metabolism within the human body having a key role in determining how we handle sugar and carbs, how many calories are extracted from our foods, and even whether we feel hungry or satisfied. Beyond these functions, our gut bacteria even play a pivotal role in the regulation of chemicals that affect our mood from one moment to the next  the neurotransmitters.So in this context, my advice is to refrain from artificial sweeteners as they represent a clear and present threat to your delicate and life supporting gut bacteria.In my new book, Brain Maker  The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brain  for Life, artificial sweeteners, antibiotics, chlorinated water, method of birth, and even food choices are some of the many factors that I explore in terms of their effects on the microbiome and how these changes affect general health as well as brain health, for better or worse.Read NextArtificially Sweetened Drinks are Not a Healthy ChoiceMost people wouldnt be surprised to learn that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages would be associated with an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).

In seeing my fairly overweight self in that picture, I committed to living a healthier lifestyle. It will be the last photo like that anyone will see.For most of my adult life I have suffered issues with my ankles. They would randomly swell up and no one could tell me why. Recently, a bone scan seemed to reveal that my cartilage has hooks and would get irritated. I lived with this problem for over 20 years. The first eight months of last year were particularly uncomfortable. My ankles, and sometimes my knees, would swell up and keep me from working. Many days I would go to work and just hobble around in pain.Last August, while home from work due to my knee being swollen (for no clear reason), I felt I had to do something. I followed the advice of Monica Reinagel, the author of theThe Inflammation Free Diet Plan, and my swelling went down immediately. Life was good. In October I started to exercise again because I felt that I had the inflammation under control. My workout program recommended that I eliminate starch and sugar for 14 days. So I did.I was watching many YouTube videos and stumbled onto some information about Grain Brain. For some reason, the information grabbed my attention. I ended up purchasing the audiobook soon thereafter. I was captivated!

You who are worried about preserving your brain power, take note: medical research now clearly links poor performance on mental function tests to elevated homocysteine levels. Having too much of this amino acid floating around in your bloodstream can cost you a few IQ points! B vitamins are also critical for mood and concentration, and a severe deficiency in B vitamins (especially vitamin B12 can result in symptoms such as severe confusion and mental fog at any age. Elevated levels of homocysteine and/or low levels of B vitamins can also increase the risk of depression, stroke, Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, heart disease, and even certain types of cancer. If you are using a drug that depletes your body of B vitamins, you must take supplemental B vitamins daily and demand to have your homocysteine levels checked periodically by your doctor.Pain RelieversGeneric name: Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid).

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/sarah-l/,"Sarahs story is a reminder that gluten sensitivity comes in many different forms.  Dr. Perlmutter11 years ago, in my third trimester of pregnancy, I developed itchy skin that made my life all but unbearable. I did neither marks nor welts on my skin. I considered myself lucky when hives would show so people didnt think I was totally crazy.I saw my GP, dermatologists, and of course a psychiatrist. I was prescribed Effexor, Adavan, Xanax. Nothing helped the itch, and I knew these drugs were not what I needed. I wasnt crazy or depressed. I was crazy and depressed because my skin felt like it was on fire, and no one could help me!For years, I endured this itch.Over the years my digestive symptoms became awful and I knew something was going on with my body. Fear, money, and trust issues kept from going to the doctor. I didnt want a pill.I have searched the internet for many years to my answer, and this year, stumbled upon a list of gluten-sensitivity symptoms via the internet. Finally!I have been gluten free since May and rarely itch anymore.I want to thank Dr. Perlmutter for writing Grain Brain because when a doctor says something, people listen.

0,Your Top Pregnancy Questions Answered!,http://foodbabe.com/2017/03/14/top-pregnancy-questions-answered/,"I have been slowly cataloging all the pregnancy questions I received while pregnantwhat prenatal vitamins I took whether Im vaccinating my baby what foods I avoided how did I prevent stretch marksdid I do a birth plan? I answer all these questions (and more!) This list will be updated regularly so if you have more questions, please ask in the comments below and Ill update this list and let you know!My sweet Harley at one week oldPhotography by Little Nest PortraitsWhat preparation did you go through before getting pregnant?Ihave been on a journey for over 10 years to get my health back on track, which helped to prepare my body for pregnancy. Over the years, acupuncture has helped tremendously to balance my hormones and heal my body. I also stopped taking birth control pills years ago, because they were preventing my body from doingwhat it is naturally supposed to do. Ive restored my gut bacteria back to normal with a whole foods diet, supplementing with effective probiotics, and eating fermented food daily.My bookThe Food Babe Waywill show you how to provide thecleanest foods for your body to prepare it for pregnancy  it includes a 21 day plan that includes all the healthy habits I follow. Another great book that I love and read (twice!) was How to Conceive Naturally: And Have a Healthy Pregnancy after 30 by Christa Orecchio, a member of my advisory council. This book is spot on about the nutrition you want to put into your body if you are tryingto conceive.What foods did you avoidwhile pregnant?Overall, I stuck with the same diet that I had before pregnancy full of whole nutrient-rich foodswith a few indulgences into those cravings  organic grilled cheeses and pizza to be exact!However, thereare a few foods that I didnt eat during pregnancySushi  especially Tuna (and other high-mercury fish): You are supposed to limit it due to mercury content, so its not worth the risk. Although I ate fish during pregnancy, I stuckto lower mercury varieties of fish such as wild salmon. Other high-mercury fish to avoid are halibut, sea bass, swordfish, shark, marlin, orange roughy, and mackerel.Processed foods: Anything that comes in a package or box or container, Iate way less of! I wanted to stay awayfrom all the packaging chemicals that food can be exposed to when it is processed  stuff you do not see on the label. Also once a food is processed, nutrients are degraded  I wanted to the get the maximum micro-nutrition out of all my food to make sure there are plenty of nutrients the baby could assimilate.Soda and sugary drinks: Sugar in general is bad, but it goes down way too easy when you drink it!MSG, yeast extract, hydrolyzed proteins, natural and artificial flavors:In the second trimester, your baby can actually start to taste the food you are eating! Knowing that gave meserious motivation to stay away from controversial food additives and processed foods that screw with your sense of taste or satisfaction. You dont want them tricked by the food industry before theyre even born!Processed and cured meats like sausage, ham, and deli: These are more likely than other foods to be contaminated with listeria, which can cause a miscarriage or infect your baby.Did you drinkraw juice while pregnant?Yes, smoothies and juices made with mostly vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals that help to keep your immune system strong during pregnancy. As always, I take care to thoroughly wash my vegetables before making a juice and fill up my blender or juicer with greens like romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, and collard greens. I tried not to overdo the beet juice though! I did that once in my first trimester and lets just say it did not stay down! Its always good to remember natural foods when juiced can be very potent too.What did you doabout cravings for bad food?Ive never had such a roller coaster of cravings before in my life (I know you other pregnant women can relate!). Read more about that here. One of myobsessions was frozen grapes to curb that sudden sweet tooth. I tookmy commitment to staying on track with my eating principles even more seriously while pregnant, even while indulging in the occasional treat. Id indulge  but I made sure the ingredients wereorganic. If I wanted cookies  Id eat them, but they need to be organic first to avoid any unnecessary toxic pesticides and chemical additives!What strict pregnancy guidelines did you adhere to? Did you eat soft cheese? Have a glass of wine? Etc.I didnt drink any alcohol, but did have some soft cheeses on occasion when I knew they were either heated or pasteurized. I continued my habit of drinking lemon water with cayenne pepper first thing in the morning, drank kombucha on occasion, reduced the amount of caffeine I used to have in half (from 8 ounces of coffee or tea to 4 ounces), and tried to eat fermented foods everyday (See more important info on pregnancy habits from my advisory council member Dr. Amy Shah here).Can you give us a breakdown of what you ate on a daily basis while being pregnant? What are some things that are completely off limits aside from the obvious foods?As always, my diet consists mostly of plants like fruits, vegetables, seeds, beans and nuts, but there are some specific foods that I ate more of during pregnancy. This is such a big topic that I wrote an entire post about it with links to my favorite recipes! Check it out here.Did you drinkthat awful glucose drink to test for gestational diabetes?These drinks (also known as Glucola) are essentially sugar water with hazardous artificial colors and preservatives fora VERY LONG shelf life. They are no better than most sodas on the market  and truly not something youd want to consume while pregnant. While its certainly important to monitor your blood glucose during pregnancy, there are saferalternatives to drinking this toxic sugar water. I simply asked my doctor what my options were and she was ready with 5 alternatives! I wasable to monitor with simple blood tests and it wasreassuring to see that my blood sugarwas on track.Specifically, I took my blood sugar two times a day for 3 days over one week and reported the results back to her.Be sure to ask your health care provider for options! In myopinion there is no way in hell any doctor could convince me to drink something with flame retardant, artificial dyes made from petroleum, controversial preservatives and GMOs, pregnant or not!Did you wear nail polish while pregnant?Only on my toes since it lasted longer and I didnt need to paint them as often. I am generally doing the same thing while breastfeeding and handling my newborn as well  although I do occasionally paint them for events andhere is a link to some safer nail polish brands Ive used.How did you handle being around a computer and wireless phone all the time?One of the things that I absolutely could not live without during pregnancy was my Belly Armor Belly Blanket. I worked from my laptop almost every day, but knew that it wasnt safe to expose my baby to all of the radiation that emits from laptops and wifi. Radiation exposures during pregnancy can increase risk of miscarriage and are also linked to developmental issues  and there was no way I was willing to take that risk. So I found an amazing solution! I just placed this Belly Blanket over my pregnant belly whenever I was working at my computer or using my phone for an extended period of time. The blanket is made with special fabric that neutralizes electromagnetic waves and blocks the radiation from reaching my belly, keeping my baby safe. This really gave me peace of mind! Now that she is born, I continue to use my Belly Blanket to protect her while Im on my computer. As a new partner of Food Babe, Belly Armor is offering you a special deal:Get a free baby hat ($19 value) if you spend $50 or more in their online store with the code foodbabe at checkout. (Note: the code will only work once you have the baby hat in your cart! These are found in their Nursery section.)How did you handle the exhaustion?Before getting pregnant, I couldnt remember the last nap I took! But once I became pregnant, I needed at least a 30 min  1 hour nap almost every day, otherwise I would fall asleep at 8pm. Your body needs more sleep during pregnancy, so dont fight it.I also drankunsweetened iced tea or kombucha to perk myself up on occasion!What do you recommend for prenatal supplements and vitamins?I didnttakeprenatal supplement formulas because the ones available on the market are one-size-fits-all and not everything in those supplementswork well with my body. I worked with my doctor to come up with a supplement regimen that worked for me. I tooka whole food based organic multivitamin with no fillers and synthetics, following theseguidelines.I also tookextra probiotics, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium which helps with sleep. Of course, I also eatThe Food Babe Wayand have been limiting the amount of sugar in my diet.What did you do to helpyou sleep?I wasable to sleep pretty well throughout my pregnancy, which Im thankful for. The vitamin and mineral supplements that I took(see above)werehelpful, but I also tooknightly baths with epsom salts. This really helpedme to relax and ease discomfort! I did not buy any special pillows, I just used a king size pillow between my legs while I slept on my side.How did you handle heartburn naturally?This simple remedy worked wonders for me: 1 tsp apple cider vinegar with 8 ounces of water. Take up to 2 doses, as needed. I also slept at an angle propped up on two pillows and took a 10 min walk after eating to help prevent heartburn.What did you do for exercise?Getting out in the fresh air makes a huge difference in everyday life! Although I didnt goat it as hard as I did before I was pregnant, just doing a little bit of something improved my mood. I keptit part of my routine and made sure to get up and go showing up to my exercise class every day, whether I coulddo everything or not! For example, I took a pilates barre class (Hilliard Studio Method) all the way up to my due date. I loved spinning in my first and second trimesters. And I lifted heavy weights with my trainer and took long walks the entire pregnancy.What did you do for your nausea?I drank ginger tea, woke up and ate first thing in the morning and had smaller meals spaced out through the day. Exercise always helped too!What did you doto prevent stretch marks?I found the most effective thing to do to avoid stretch marks is eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid processed foods while your tummy is growing. All those vitamins and minerals strengthen the skins elasticity! I also used organic coconut oil and/or sesame oil on my body every day.Did you take the flu shot during pregnancy?Idont normally take the flu shot because it has shown to be not effective (so I dont take the risk) and I would personally never consider it as a pregnant woman. Iwant mybody to react naturally to the environment and to fight viruses on its own. I take steps to prevent the flu  wash hands often, reduce stress, exercise, drink lots of filtered water, eat fermented foods, and avoid industrial toxins. I believe that livinga healthy lifestyle sets you up for a healthy pregnancy.Did you have anatural birth?Yes, you can read my birth story here.Did youencapsulate your placenta?No, I did not. I discussed this with my doctor and doula, researched options and there was not enough convincing evidence for me, although I have heard it does benefit some women.Did you do something for your baby shower registry to specify no plastics? If so, how did you make those requests known?The awesome women throwing me the shower put my preferences on the invitation. I had an eco baby shower, for example, instead of bringing a card with a gift, they requested guests bring an inscribed book instead. I also registered for a lot of eco-friendly items at Sprout San Francisco.What was your Birth Plan?My birth plan is below, this is highly personalized and you should talk about these choices with your family and health care providers before determining your own.This list is intended to express our preferences under normal conditions.Labor Preferences: A Natural Birth. I will use natural pain relief techniques. Please do not offer any medication, I will ask if needed. I have an adverse reaction to most pharmaceuticals. Interventions only following opportunity to discuss options with husband and doula. I prefer minimal internal exams. A vaginal exam only when I ask to be checked. I prefer to move freely during labor and eat and drink as needed.  I prefer only intermittent monitoring when needed. I prefer to have no IV but will consent to a saline lock, if medically necessary. I prefer no induction of any kind. I prefer the bag of waters to break on its own. I would like perineal support with massage, hot compresses and various positions to avoid a tear.  I prefer no episiotomy unless required for babys safety. I prefer that no vacuum or forceps are used.Birth Preferences: Please place baby on my bare chest immediately.  Please do not cut cord for 15 minutes or until it stops pulsing. Father will plan on cutting cord. Please allow placenta to expel on its own.Newborn Preferences: Please conduct newborn procedures in arms, at least 2 hours after birth.  We have chosen to DECLINE: erythomycin, Hep B vaccine (baby will follow up with Pediatrician), and Vitamin K shot (baby will be taking liquid Vitamin K per Stanford University Protocol). We consent to: newborn screening (including PKU), necessary emergency treatment. Please conduct all in room. Father will accompany baby for hearing test.Afterbirth Preferences:  Baby will be breastfed exclusively. Please do not offer sugar water or formula.  I wish for baby to remain with me following birth. Father will accompany baby out of room if needed. I do not wish to receive any medication post labor, including stool softener.  I prefer to leave the hospital as soon as possible after birth. Should a transfer be necessary for baby, please allow me to accompany baby.In case a Cesarean becomes necessary: Husband and doula present in operating room. Father holds baby immediately for skin-to-skin and stays with baby continually. Doula present continually during recovery. Newborn reunited with mother as soon as possible.Did you take any classes?Yes! I did the Mama Natural Birth Course from start to finish and loved it so much. This is a digital course that you watch from home on your own time, and on your own schedule. It is super informative and I left each lesson feeling empowered and confident. I can honestly say that I dont believe Ive ever enjoyed an online course as much as this one. You can sign up here for free and Mama Natural will send you weekly pregnancy updatesand you can find information on the Mama Natural Birth Course here.Are you going to vaccinate your child?Themost powerful thing you can do for your health is become educated about everythingyou put in your own and your familys bodies  whether it be the food you eat or the pharmaceuticals you inject. Vaccines are not one-size-fits-all and I feel that is way too simplistic of a view  and my doctor agrees. Not all vaccines are created equal. It is really important to recognize that what can help one person, has the ability to hurt another. Eachvaccine needs to be evaluated individually for its benefits and risks relative to your personal situation.Understand that Im not an expert on vaccines recommended by the CDC for children, but now that Im a parentI feel that it is my obligation to become as educated as possible on the subject so Ive been doing A LOT of reading! I have checked out or ordered just about every vaccine advice book under the sun and am doing a thorough personal investigation to become as educated as possible about my choices. I have also been taking the time to talk to my own doctors and trusted advisors to make the best decisions. I encourage you to do the same and make thedecision for yourself as to what you feel comfortable with. Here is one of my favorite books I read about the topic.What type of meal plans can I follow to help get me ready to become pregnant or while pregnant?Join us inthe Food Babe Eating Guide Program.

1,The Importance Of Gut Bacteria In Pregnancy (and how we destroy it with modern practices!),http://foodbabe.com/2017/03/14/importance-gut-bacteria-pregnancy-destroy-modern-practices/,"This is a guest post written by Dr. Amy Shah, a member of my Advisory Council. Dr. Shah is a practicing physician, specializing in Allergy & Immunology and Internal Medicine. Dr. Shah is also a mom, and as we were recently discussing my pregnancy she brought up a topic that I believe will be very helpful to all of the other mamas-to-be out there! How can you nurturethe bacteria in your gut to protect the future health of your child?{Photo credit: Brad Olson photography}Nurturing bacteria in pregnancy and childbirth may be the key to unlocking the mystery behind the modern American crisis of diabetes, autoimmunity, asthma, allergies, obesity and more!Here is how we in medicine think this happensThere are 2 basic arms of the immune system: Th1 and Th2. These are white blood cells known as T-helpers that recognize and combat pathogens. Th1 fights bacteria, and viruses; Th2 takes on parasites, allergies and, we think, does not have much of a role these days.During pregnancy the body is weighted towards Th2. The hypothesis is that is so the body does not activate the immune system against the growing fetus. When the baby is born it is also predominantly Th2. Because of the lack of bacteria (good and bad) and viruses in the modern world, the baby stays weighted towards the Th2 immune side instead of shifting back to Th1 side. This, we think, is why we have seen such an increase allergy, asthma and autoimmune disease!So what is the take away?Improve your babys life (and yours) by nurturing the bacteria around you. Our bacteria stand as an army blocking or helping things pass through into the body.I know its hard to believe, but there is more bacteria in our body than our cells! Heres what you can do to grow your gut garden:1. Avoid hand sanitizers and cleaning products when pregnant!I cant tell you how many times I see new moms slather hand sanitizer over themselves and anyone who comes close to their little one. The logic is there  of course you dont want pathogens near your sensitive newborn. But  AND A BIG BUT  is this sterilization may be doing more harm than good by blocking the colonization of nurturing bacteria.More concerning  ingredients in hand sanitizers are known endocrine disruptors that adversely affect sex hormones, especially in infants and new mothers. Endocrine disruptors are also found abundantly in common triclosan-based cleaning products. Use natural cleaning products when possible (or have someone else clean!)Tip: Dont let sick people go near your newborn but for others gentle washing with natural soap and water is preferred.2. Avoid C-sections when possible.Of course this isnt always possible and a C-section is necessary, but if it can be avoided, it should be. Immense difference has been reported in the microbiological constitution of babies born vaginally vs. C-section babies. C-section babies dont get microbes from the birth canal, which are different than those colonized by the skin, nipple and milk.A diverse microbiome is significant, as a less diverse microbiome means more chance the immune system will stay in the TH2  meaning a higher probability of asthma, allergies and obesity related immune disease later in life.Tip: If C-section is absolutely medically necessary, dont fret  skin to skin contact, breast feeding, and other techniques to improve babys microbiome exist.3. Avoid antibiotics  and that includes the food you eat!Again, of course, sometimes antibiotics are necessary and cant be avoided but we may be overly reliant on them as a panacea for every ill. Generally avoid antibiotics for gut health, but especially for your infant and when pregnant or breastfeeding. They wreak havoc on the gut garden, destroying good bacteria with the bad, decreasing bacterial diversity and even creating a leaky gut and mood disorders.Foods containing antibiotics can be assumed to have the same effect. Avoid conventional meats and dairy and instead look for products labeled organic  federally regulated to only come from animals never given antibiotics.4. Play with dirt and animals.You may have heard of the so-called Hygiene Hypothesis that speculates children raised in overly sterile, germ-free environments develop hypersensitive immune systems. Though it may sound counter-intuitive (and gross), exposing infants in their first year of development to pets, household germs, microbes found in soil, rodent dander and roach allergens appears to lay foundations for a robust immune system, lowering risk of asthma and allergies, according to research from Johns Hopkins.However, after the first year, the protective effects of exposure to dander, germs and droppings disappear. Playing in the dirt, on the other hand, seems to improve gut health no matter what age you are, so dont be afraid to be a little dirty!5. Breastfeed instead of formula feeding.Dont be too quick to wean off breast milk and introduce formula or solid food. Colonization and proliferation of an infants microbiota can be distressed when exclusive human-milk feeding is stopped. Formula especially incorporated into the diet while breastfeeding can undesirably alter the structure of babys gut.6. Practice Kangaroo Mother Care.Skin to skin contact, especially right after birth (even for preemies), exposes the newborn to the mothers bacteria, creating a more diverse gut garden.Kangaroo Mother Care  basically oodles of naked baby skin on skin exposure several hours a day  has a myriad of additional benefits for babys overall health. For example, breastfeeding maybe easier as it aids baby to seek out and latch on to moms nipple, reducing soreness.Studies suggest that babies deprived of skin contact can contribute to mood issues like depression and learning disabilities later in life.7. Your diet is KING for yourself and your baby.Obviously diet is top on the list of effectors to the intestinal microbiome. Sugar and processed, chemicalized, artificial foods dont just upset gut equilibrium but can lead to leaky gut, IBS and other digestive issues you dont want.Best course of action for a diet to improvegut health:Eat an organic whole food diet rich in nutrient dense foods like vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats.Steer clear of GMOs, artificial sweeteners, ibuprofen/NSAIDs, preservatives like TBHQ, etc.Eat and drink an abundance of superfoods like algae, seaweed, aloe vera, and cacao.Get plenty of probiotics and fermented foods like kefir and sauerkraut as well as prebiotics like tubers and alliums.The healthier your gut flora while pregnant and breastfeeding, the healthier your babys constitution  establishing their health now and for the rest of their life.Dr. Amy Shah is a specialist in Allergy & Immunology and Internal Medicine.

2,"How To Create The Safest, Organic and Natural Nursery For Your Child",http://foodbabe.com/2017/02/16/create-safest-organic-natural-nursery-child/,"When I first became pregnant, I knew right away I wanted to create a safe environment and nursery for my baby. There was so much to research and it all was very overwhelming. Cribs, mattresses, clothes, diapers, toys, strollers, car seats  the list goes on and on and on! I remember walking into Buy Buy Baby for the first time and walking right back out because it was too much to handle! But all my frustration quickly went away after I met the founder of Sprout San Francisco, a natural and organic childrens store in CA. Suzanne Price is a mother of two who has devoted her life researching toxic chemicals in childrens products and their effects on their bodies. When we met while I was on a business trip last year, we instantly hit it off. Her passion was contagious! Suzanne created Sprout to be a one-stop-shop for new parentswho want to outfittheir nursery with the safest and healthiest products. Sprout has done all the research for usand only stocks their store with products that get their seal of approval. I loved how Icould walk in to their store and feel comfortableas a new mom who wants to do the very best for my baby, knowing that everythingon the shelves is non-toxic and safe for my newborn.Shopping at Sprout was SO FUN! I didnt have to stress out researching every little thing myself! The staff made it so simple tooutfit my entire nursery and set up ababy registry formy friends and family.Iwas so impressed with everything they did for me and Harley, that I asked Suzanne to share her top tips and recommendations for a safe, natural and organic nursery in this special guest post.Also, to help all the other moms and dads out there, I partnered with Sprout to offer a 15% discount on your purchase when you use the code FOODBABE at checkout here.These pictures were taken by Little Nest Portraits(highly recommend them!)during Harleys one week old photo shoot.Still working on commissioning some low VOC art and picture frames for the walls, but Harleys nursery is almost done!Sprouts Baby Nursery Buying Guide:At Sprout, we try to provide everything a family needs for a new baby in the healthiest and most natural way possible. We offer a gift registry so people can let their friends know what to buy them, an app to register on their iPhone, and a registry checklist so that parents can make sure they have not forgotten anything they might need. We even provide Healthy Baby Guides on our website that help parents to learn everything they should be looking out for in every category. However, I sometimes forget how overwhelming this can be to parents who are learning about all of it at once for the first time. I decided to break down the main things you need to make sure you have in order to bring your baby home, and what Sprout looks for in each category to make sure it is as healthy for your baby as possible.Crib and Dresser / Changing Table: Try to find solid wood with low VOC paint. Most cheap cribs are made with particle board thats stuck together using glue that emits formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Vanis Skylar Crib is made in the USA using solid hardwoods (pictured above). Youll also want a bookshelf to store all the adorable books and picture frames youll receive as gifts, as well as a comfortable place to change the baby, such as the top of a dresser with a secured organic changing pad.Crib Mattress: This is the most important thing to buy organic. Traditional mattresses are made of foam that release particulars into the air (VOCs) that are not good for your babys lungs. They are also sprayed with flame retardant chemicals, horrible for a baby to breath and known to cause lots of different health issues. Putting an organic mattress pad cover on a regular mattress does NOT solve the problem. But you should also have an organic mattress pad cover. Sprout sells a variety of organic mattresses. Vani chose Naturepedic (pictured above) and a fullyorganic co-sleeper here.Crib Bedding: Since your baby will spend so much time lying on these sheets, it is important to have organic crib sheets. Consider trying a solid white sheet with a patterned crib skirt to add some decoration to the crib if you do not fall in love with any of the organic patterned sheets.Clothing: You are going to get tons of clothing as gifts, and from everywhere, but you should definitely register for things you like. At the very newborn stage, its nice to have organic cotton touching your babys skin since it has been shown that pesticides can rub off of a finished garment. (Cotton is the most heavily pesticided crop in the country.) I would suggest registering for some layette sets like kimono tops (so they dont have to be pulled over the head) and pants in organic cotton and let people buy you all the other cute fun outfits for the older sizes. The first few weeks the baby will basically be in a shirt or bodysuit and a swaddle all the time anyway.Baby Carrier: Our favorite carriers are the adjustable, backpack-style Beco or the wrap-style Solly. Whichever you choose, prioritize organic, since its shocking how much the babies suck on the fabric and straps.Baby Bath: Make absolutely sure that it is free of BPA, PVC, andphthalates. These are 3 terrible chemicals in plastics that will leach into warm water.Car Seat: Many car seats are sprayed with toxic flame retardant chemicals. Find one that is GREENGUARD or OEKO-TEX certified, or that promises it does not use any of the worst flame retardants, like Tris. The only infant seat we carry is one we have had tested and know to be free of Tris, the Nuna Pipa.Toys: I always opt for wood or organic cotton over plastic. Phthalates in plastics were outlawed in toys for kids under 3 in 2009, yet nobody really knows this (so dont take hand-me-downs) and from what I have heard, it is not really enforced, especially for products made overseas.Glider / Rocker: A glider or rocker isnt an absolute must-have, but many find it extremely helpful in those early days of nursing your baby in the middle of the night. Make sure to look for one that does not have foam sprayed with flame retardant chemicals. Our exclusive gliders do not have flame retardants or polyurethane foam. Vani has our Como Pure in her nursery (pictured above).Rug: Many rugs are backed with formaldehyde emitting glue. Find a rug for your nursery made of natural fibers with no glue backing, so that your baby will be safe laying on it during tummy time.Art: To finish off your nursery, add some cute artwork to walls to give the room a personal touch. Just make sure that anything with paint is low VOC. Vani used Natura by Benjamin Moore.I think this is a good place to start and not get overwhelmed. Of course you can always call or come into one of our stores to ask as many questions you like of our knowledgeable sales team.Good luck!If you want to pick up any of these babyessentials or other amazing safe baby products, feel free to use the discount codeFOODBABE when you visit Sprout herefor 15% off.Iknowwhen you are expecting you have so many things to think about, so I hope this helps you out as much as it did me!

3,My Birth Story. Our Little Angel Is Here!,http://foodbabe.com/2017/01/24/birth-story-little-angel/,"Our little angel is here and we are so crazy in love. Meet Harley Diane, 6.5 pounds and 20 inches. Every time I look at her, myheart feels like it is going to explode! This is my birth storyI prepared right from the start for a natural child birthWhen I became pregnant back in April 2016, I knew right away I wanted to have a natural birth and my commitment became even stronger after talking to several experts, reading many books about child birth, taking a natural birth course and talking to my doctor & doula about the risks associated with some interventions and drugs. Hearing all my friends and familys birth stories, as well as reading and watching many online, there was one big common theme  there are no two births that are the same and things dont always go as planned! So I decided to go into all of this with a very easy going attitude and not get too worked up if things did not turn out the way I expected them to go. I said to myself whatever happens, happens, as long as I have a healthy baby at the end, nothing else matters. And I also repeated the mantra My body was designed to do this to prime my brain to stay focused on the goal.One of the biggestreasons I wanted a natural birth was because I know how my body reacts to foreign substances and pharmaceutical drugs  I dont feel good after taking them and often feel the bad side effects for weeks. Not only did I not want those substances to get to my newborn baby, but I wanted to have the fastest recovery possible after birth. I also have undergone two different abdominal surgeries in my lifetime and know the recovery is not for the faint of heart. These experiences have given me a very strong conviction to do what I can in my power to avoid medical interventions. Feeling the way I do now  a week later  I know I made the right decision for me to focus on a natural birth. I remain in awe that everything worked out the way I envisioned it to.I thought I would deliver early but no!The month leading up to the birth, I started to get Braxton Hicks contractions and at first they didnt hurt at all, and then suddenly on Christmas Eve (38 weeks) they began to hurt. The entire day on Christmas Eve, I was having contractions and even contracting at my brothers Christmas Eve party that evening. It was nothing too painful at this point, but I for sure thought I would have a Christmas baby (and my family thought so too!). A doctor friend at the party even wanted me to go to the hospital to get checked but I didnt go and eventually on Christmas Day all the contractions fizzled out.When you hit your due date everyone in the world starts calling and texting you, wondering when you are going to give birth. This can be stressful if you let it but after she didnt come early during the holiday break, I became super patient leading up to her birthday. Babies are born on their birthdays is one of my affirmation cards that I read every night and this kept me focused on taking care of myself, staying calm and relaxed before birth, knowing that my baby would arrive when she was ready. The extra week, gave me time to continue organizing closets and cabinets throughout the house  which I am so glad to have done now!The week leading up to the birthI have been using acupuncture for years as preventative medicine, but when I became pregnant, I started to go to acupuncture almost every week. Not only did this help my pregnancy symptoms (just ask my best friend, who said I never complained during my pregnancy!) but it primed my body for the best birth possible. When I hit 39.5 weeks, I had 3 acupuncture treatments over the course of one week to get my body ready for big day. Acupuncture can help start labor if your baby is ready! After these treatments, I started a type of early labor on Tuesday and Wednesday both nights I woke up at around 3am with painful contractions that hit every 20 mins or so but would tinker on and off throughout the day.The daybefore birthOn Thursday, the day before 41 weeks, I saw my doctor and we did a quick safety ultrasound check just to make sure I still had enough amniotic fluid and to see if the baby was doing well in there. As long as everything looked good, she was going to just let me keep going in my late pregnancy until the baby was ready. This was very exciting  I hadnt seen my baby for over 24 weeks! Everything turned out perfectly! She also checked my cervix and reported that I was 3 cm dilated and 75% effaced, all that early labor was working! This put me at so much ease and I was relaxed enough to go to the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art that afternoon (even though I was still contracting!) to walk around and keep my body moving. We bought the baby an art book to remember the moment and eventually my contractions fizzled out again to relax a bit for dinner.41 weeks pregnant! Last belly shot before the hospitalThe big dayAfter 2 nights of no sleep, I finally went into REAL labor late Thursday night  actually at about 2:30am Friday morning. The contractions hadsped up significantly to every8-10 minutes all night long. At about 5:30am I texted my doula and she wanted me to keep her posted on progress and we kept in touch throughout the morning. I labored at home finding any position to get me through  hands and knees and bending over with my arms on a wall were the best positions. At around noon, I knew it was time for my doula to come over, it was getting intense and I was having contractions every 5 minutes.What contractions feel likeFor those of youwho have never given birth or experienced contractions, it feels likethe worst stomach cramp you have ever experienced, and like a wave of sensation with a strong peak that you absolutely have to breathe to get through if you want to be able to handle the pain. It takes all of your focus and concentration during the contraction just toget to the next one. The key is to relax in between the contractions as much as possible so you can get through the next one.Is it time to go to the hospital yet?I had been in my bedroom all morning by the timemy doula arrived. She got me up out of bed and said take me on a tour of your house and so we went through and walked my entire house  going up and down the stairs in my house, I contracted on each wall! I had to hold on to her or the wall and bend down for every contraction. After the tour, I thought it would be a good time toeat something, my doula suggested soup and my husband warmed me up some butternut squash soup I had made for our freezer meals after the baby was born. I ate that with some crackers and water. It was so good! I was starving! Then it was finally time for the tub. This was my doulaslast resort before getting to the hospital, getting from the stage of early labor to active labor so I would not be in the hospital for too long before giving birth.According to many natural birth experts, if you get to the hospital too early, there is more time for interventions, so the key is to get there at just the right time to avoid that. My doula was very experienced in knowing when to go and without her, I probably would have left earlier my husband was definitely getting antsy and a bit nervous at this point!I had a ginger blackberry popsicle in the bath  it was delicious, but I couldnt finish it  the contractions were coming too strong! The bath helped me get through them until about 5:00pm, and then I started feeling an intense amount of pelvic pressure that made me want to push.When my doula witnessed this, she knew it was time to head to the hospital. My husband put the last minute things in the car, handed me my labor robe and nightgown to wear and walked me down the stairs to the car. I was worried about the car ride to the hospital, because even though we were close to the hospital, I was contracting every two minutes. I didnt want to get out of the bath either because it was such an amazing feeling and the soothing warmth of the water was helping so much with the intense contractions.We arrived at the hospital at 5:30pmOnce I got to the hospital, I completed a cervical exam (my least favorite thing to do while being pregnant!)  I was at 6 cm and a midwife had to double check it because they thought I had broke my water already too. My doula and I were stunned that they said that I broke it because I didnt feel anything at all! That same day, Ihad lost my mucus plug however, which I had been looking forward to seeing as a sign of labor. It was one of those things I was looking for every time Iused the bathroom but never found prior to that day. As soon as we got settled into thedelivery room, one of my first contractions broke my water. It was the loudest pop Id ever heard inside my body and it brought on a flood of emotions (no pun intended!). It still baffles me that they thought I had already broke it!My doula whispered to me, things are about to speed up, so lets get the tub ready. The tub in the delivery room had thesemagical massaging jets that I didnt have at home and I was really excited about that. My contractions were coming really fast and very hard in the tub. So hard that the jets no longer felt good and after a few minutes, I begged andscreamed to turn the jets off. It got so hot, I thought Iwas going to melt. Thank goodness for the cooler of coconut water my husband brought to the delivery room  I think I drank about 4 bottles within just a few hours. And this whole time, my sweet nurse was trying to monitor the babys heart beat which for some reason really made me uncomfortable, the tiny bit of pressure from the hand held doppler on my pelvis was driving me nuts!In transition, I was loud like an animal!I screamed like an animal for a couple of hours (my throat hurt so bad the next day  so remember to bring some organic throat dropswith you mamas!). Giving birth is such a primal experience, and I never thought I would hear the sounds that would come out of my mouth. I was in full gorilla ape mode! Leading up to my birth, I thought I would be a quiet birther but heck no! Making the animal sounds really helped me get through the intensity.My doctor, who is a huge advocate for natural birth and very supportive of my birth plan, arrived at the scene. I was SO HAPPY to see her. I was progressing so fast and when I got out of the tub, I couldnt believe it  I was fully dilated and ready to push about 8:45pm.Pushing was very athletic!I got back to the delivery bedand tried to find some positions that would be the bestto push in. As many mamas know, laying on your back is not really the most comfortable position during contractions or pushing, and my birth team had some other tricks up their sleeve. It ended up being that asquat bar and laying on my side were what worked best for me. So I used both of those positions throughout my pushing.At this point, I had been laboring for about 18 hours and I was tired! But the pain was not that bad, nothing worse than what I had already experienced up until that point.At first it took me awhile to get a hang of pushing. I had been breathing heavily through contractions, and my birth team reallywanted me to push through contractions while holding my breath  the opposite of what I had been doing all day long! That was difficult for me and really stressed out my body. I felt intense pain on my chest, holding my breath and almost like I was drowning from the lack of oxygen!I eventually got the hang of it and only pushed for an hour and a half before my daughter was born at 10:11pm.The final pushes were really athletic and it took everything in me to focus  I felt the ring of fire, but it wasnt as bad as I expected. When she finally came out, I heard the doctor do something (but didnt really know what was happening at the time because I couldnt believe I just pushed her out) and then she checked to see if I tore, and said everything looked great  no tears to stitch!In absolute aweIwas so stunned and so in awe when my daughter was born the sense of accomplishment the excitement of seeing her for the first time everything that you dream about. It is so magical and the feeling of relief is so instant that everything you did up until that point becomes a BILLION times worth it!For every birth video I had seen since I became pregnant, I cried at the end when the baby was born. Even reading a birth story, I would cry at the end. But when my own baby came, I didnt cry. I was just so happy and I felt my heart exploding with love! I will never ever be able to equate giving birth to anything else Ive ever accomplished in my life. It is definitely my greatest achievement and was so thankful everything went as I had hoped.After the birth, we waited until the cord stopped pulsating and my husband cut the cord, I got to spend a lot of time skin to skin with my baby and breastfeeding, but the baby nurse did take her away to weigh her, measure her, clean out her nasal passages and mouth and take a blood sample to test her blood sugar (which in hindsight  I wish I would have waited for). It felt like an eternity those few minutes she was out of my arms!We spent about 36 hours more at the hospital before going homeThe next morning, I really just wanted to take my baby in my arms and say peace out, but I had to stay to monitor my blood pressure that was high after birth. Thankfully it has been treated naturally since leaving the hospital and is back down. They did prescribe me some pharmaceuticalsfor high blood pressure to take at home before I left (which I didnt end up taking). I know my body, and knew it would be back to normal in a flash, if I rested and allowed my body recover from the lack of sleep and exhaustion!I also had a wonderful at home acupuncture treatment about 5 days later that worked like a miracle for my blood pressure and sore muscles.More details emerge about my birthWhen mydoula came over for a postpartum visit, I learned that my baby was born with the cord wrapped around her neck, this is what I heard my doctor taking care of, but didnt see it when she was coming out. My doctor gently looped the cord back over her head before the rest of her body came out, and the cord was long enough that it didnt pose any danger during the delivery, thank God! It was kinda scary learning about this days later, but it is a really very common thing to happen. Its amazing that a safe natural birth is still possible in circumstances like this!Having strong support is a must!I know I couldnt have achieved a natural child birth without the coaching of a doula, a supportive doctor, and a very positive and helpful nurse  I had the A Team for sure! Giving birthis like a marathon. At a marathon, at every water stop along the way, you have people cheering you on with motivational signs and encouragingyou to finish. You need the same support while giving birthbecause there are so many times you think to yourself that you cant do it or youre not sure if it is possible or if something will go wrong and you are tired! You need thatpositive energy in the room to get you through it. There were a few moments during labor where I asked the team can I do this? and they would say yes,you can do this, and that really motivated me. Taking drugs, however, did not enter my mind once! I credit this to my daily practice ofbirth affirmation cardsleading up to the birth.I feel incredibly lucky I got to experience natural hospital birth, which I know is not often the case for many.There were times when I thought I willnever, ever, ever have another child while I was going through the really tough parts of labor (the point where my water broke to the point where I started pushing), but that thought went 100% out the window after meeting my baby and the high that I felt of accomplishing my goal of a natural childbirth. I will take 10 babies please!!!! Mr. Food Babe, are you ready? haha.A heartfelt thank you to my extended birth team!I want to thank my magical birth team: my dear husband who was 100% supportive of my decision to go natural and even more incredible now as a new Dad, all of the women in my life that shared their advice, birth stories and wisdom with me, Genevieve from Mama Naturalfor her amazing birth course and affirmation cards, Megan from Detoxinista, Latham Thomas from Mama Glow, my sister-in-law Judy who has given natural birth twice!, my trainers atHilliard Studio MethodandK.O.

They are moving in the right direction and they arent alone.The good food revolution is in full force thanks to the Food Babe Army, activist organizations and countless consumers that are taking back their health!When I look back on 2016, one of the things Im so proud of isseeing the public become increasingly aware of the unethicaltactics employed by the food and chemical companies to mislead consumers. Thanks largely to the work done by consumerinterest groups like U.S. Right to Know, Food and Water Watch,Center for Food Safety and The Cornucopia Institute we now see exactly how companiesuse front groups, scientists, and other paid experts to conduct covert public relationsfor them. The Food Babe Army has been very instrumental in spreading the word and we are creating a better informed public! We now know why they are attacking us for simply asking for healthy food and how to fight back. There are some big revelations on this front to come next year, and I couldnt be more proud of the amazing work that we are doing together. The Food Babe Army Rocks!!!The Most Loved Instagram Posts of 2016!JanuaryCampbells labels GMO ingredients (January 7, 2016)  The new year started out with a bang when one of the largest food corporations in the U.S. announced they will begin labeling GMOs on all of their products, which includePepperidge Farm, Prego, Plum Organics and V8, and they anticipate that labeling will be complete within 12 to 18 months. We had previously exposed the GMOs in their products here, and the Food Babe Army showedour thanks to Campbells for being the first major brand to label the GMOs in their products in the U.S.All the letters you sent to Campbells thanking them for labeling GMOs  So nice of them to acknowledge our efforts!Vani Harinamed one of Americas 50 Most Powerful People in Food for 2016 by The Daily Meal(January 27, 2016) I was honored to make this list as one of the watchdogs, the inspirers, the facilitators of the food movement in America.

You area force like no other!Starbucks publishes drink ingredientsfor first time in history Sometime in January, we noticed that Starbucks quietly added ingredient lists for their drinks to their website. This is a campaign that we have been working on since 2012 (see here, here, here, and here) and these posts have been shared hundreds of thousands of times. Starbucks used to claim that their ingredients were proprietary and refused to disclose  so this is a huge win for transparency!FebruaryMars removes artificial colors from candies (February 5, 2016)  The maker of M&Ms, Skittles, and Starburst willremove all artificial colors from all of their products(excluding pet foods) within the next 5 years. Renee Shutters (an activist consumer) and The Center For Science In The Public Interest petitioned to remove the dyes from M&Ms, and received over 217K signatures!Vani Harinamed one of The 13 Most Powerful Women in Food by The Daily Meal (February 19, 2016)  Pretty surreal a food activist was on this list with Oprah Winfrey and the CEOs of major food companies!Perdueschicken strips go antibiotic-free (February 26, 2016) Perdue announced that they would eliminate chicken raised on antibiotics from their chicken strips and nuggets sold in grocery stores by June 2016. This just goes to show that it doesnt need to take YEARSto accomplish this! This makes them the largest supplier of antibiotic-free chicken strips in the U.S. Yet, this is still only a portion of the chicken that Purdue produces, so I am still waiting for them to eliminate the routine use of antibiotics across their entire product line. We have campaigned along with dozens of consumer interest groups to to stop the dangerous routine use of antibiotics on farms and we are slowly chipping away at it (see here, here, here, here, and here).MarchThe Food Babe Way is released in paperback!  My first book,The Food Babe Way,was a #1 bestseller & New York Times Best Seller  selling more books than any other book the week that it was released in 2015. I have continued to be astonished by all your support, generous love and am humbled and forever grateful for every single person that has read this book and have helped to spread the word and get this message out.The Food Babe Wayis for anyone whos tired of the food industry hijacking their taste buds and wants to take matters into their own hands and become their own food investigator, nutritionist, and food activist. Theres a way to survive and look good without dieting, and this book contains the 21 essential habits that I taught myself to take control of my health. It is now available in paperback online here.AtThe Natural Living Expo in Boston, MAIn-N-Out Burger commits to stopping routine antibiotic use (March 2, 2016)  On February 24th, I joined over 50 public interest and consumer advocacy groups in sending a letter to In-N-Out Burger, asking them to phase out the routine use of antibiotics across all of their meat supply chains(as well as usingbeta-agonists and growth hormones) and also to provide a more healthful and sustainable grass-fed option on the menu. The following week, In-N-Out Burger responded by telling reporters,Our company is committed to beef that is not raised with antibiotics important to human medicine, and weve asked our suppliers to accelerate their progress towards establishing antibiotic alternatives.Although they stated they are moving in that direction, they have not provided a timeline, so this fight is not over. Heres more about whats in their food.General Mills labels GMO ingredients (March 18, 2016)  Two days after the DARK Act was initially defeated by the Senate, General Mills was the first company to announce that they will label GMOs on all of their products within the U.S.Their product line includes Yoplait, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Chex, Progresso, and Fruit By The Foot. Will they keep this commitment now that the DARK Act was revived and signed into lawin July?Kelloggs & Mars both label GMO ingredients (March 21, 2016) Just a few days later, both of these companies followed suit by announcing they will also label GMOs in their products throughout the U.S. within months.ConAgra labels GMO ingredients (March 22, 2015) Quicklyon their heels, ConAgra said theywill also begin adding labels to products nationwide by July  their brands includeBanquet, Chef Boyardee, Hunts, and Marie Callenders.Campbells eliminates BPA from cans (March 28, 2015)  Campbells announces they will transition to BPA-Free cans by the mid-2107 in the U.S. and Canada. They are the largest canned soup maker in the U.S., so this is huge!Del Monte joins the Food Babe Army (March 29, 2015)  Del Monte told reporters that they will begin to move away from GMOs and that they would add non-GMO labels to their products that dont contain them. When I thanked Del Monte on Twitter for their decision  they told me: We are happy to join your #FoodBabeArmy! these brands are listening to us!!!

Instead of just removing GMO ingredients (like sugar from GMO beets) from their ingredients, they are taking it a step further to ensure that the milk comes from cows that are not fed GMO feed. This is a HUGEand outstanding commitment given that the vast majority of GMO crops are fed to farm animals. They also committed to labeling GMOs in their remaining products and are holding strong, despite being attacked by the industry!Moms Across America Launched Organic Awareness Campaign (April 24, 2016) This billboard was in 191 locations across 35 cities. This is a health solution not only for consumers, but for our earth. 1 out of 2 U.S children have a chronic illness. Studies also show organic improves the health of farmers, the quality of the soil, water, plants and reduces climate change.MayPizza Hut removes controversial preservativesand switches to antibiotic-free chicken (May 31, 2016)  Pizza Hut began making big changes to their ingredients which include removing BHA and BHT from all of their meats and removing preservatives from cheese by March 2017. They also have plans to get rid of additional unnecessary additives and preservatives in their food by 2020.Most importantly, they will stop sourcing chicken (as a pizza topping) that was raised on human antibiotics byMarch 2017  now they just need to include their chicken wings and other meats in this policy! We raised awareness of the preservative BHT when we petitioned Kelloggs and General Mills to remove it from their cereals in 2015.JuneAdweek names Vani Harione ofthe 30 Most Influential People in Food!(June 5, 2016)  I was over the moon to be considered on the same list as my favorite foodies Anthony Bourdain and Ina Garten  even more so, considering the attention to our good food movement activism!In June, I completed a whirlwind book tour in Spain forthe Spanish version of my book, The Food Babe Way(El mtodo Food Babe). Overseas, Monsanto and pro-GMO proponentsdo not easily influencethe government and the mediawith their propaganda it was refreshing to be around people not scared to report the truth about the chemicals in our food. I was able to spread our message widely in Spain and reached so many people in a short amount of time! Heres some of the press we received:Vogue: Un zumo 20 minutos antes del desayuno y otros trucos para comer sano sin estar a dietaTelva: El mtodo The Food Babe para adelgazar en 21 dasHola: El mtodo de Bella Hadid para presumir de cuerpo diezEnfemenino: Los mejores libros del momento para adelgazar y ponerte en formaABC: El mtodo para conseguir el cuerpazo de Bella Hadidyodona: Sabes lo que comes?

They are still selling the old GMO-filled Goldfish though, so check those labels!Panera Bread removes more artificial ingredients (June 15, 2016)  Ditches artificial ingredients in their grocery store products(which includesoups, breads, deli meats, coffee and salad dressings).

They will alsobe removing high fructose corn syrup from all of their buns!They likely made this move after they received double digit sales increaseswhenthey reformulated their Egg McMuffin last year with simpler ingredients. This just goes to show that it pays off to improve their products with better ingredients!Cheez-Its indicates theywill remove TBHQ (August 26, 2016) Ourfacebook post exposing the TBHQ in Cheez-It crackers went viral with over 12 million views and 185,000 shares. This synthetic preservative is a form of butane (a very toxic gas) and has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, and stomach cancer in animal studies. New research coming out of Michigan State University links it to the rise in food allergies, which has prompted more research. Although the FDA allows TBHQin America, itis banned for use in food in other countries including Japan. Cheez-It took notice and responded that they are actively testing a number of natural alternatives to TBHQ  but how many more people will continue to consume TBHQ before they change it?SeptemberIn September, I spoke at the Hawaii-Center for Food Safetys event called the Ethics of Eating. The Center For Food Safetyisa nonprofit organization that promotes organic and sustainable agriculturewith work focusing on the public health impacts of the pesticides and herbicides used on GMOs, and because of this, they are heavily targeted by the biotech companies who are profiting off of these chemicals and technologies. Despite unethical efforts by the biotech industry to disrupt my talk, we had a packed house and standing room only! We streamed the eventlive on Facebookand it was a huge success. Thank you Hawaii-Center For Food Safety for the incredible hospitality and of course, for hiring additional security to keep the event on track!Ethics of Eating Talk at The University of Hawaii,09/15/2016Healthy Futures SALT Salonhosted by The Center For Food Safety, Honolulu, HawaiiStouffers simplifies ingredients in their lasagna (September 6, 2016)  Nestle reformulated their recipe and removedautolyzed yeast extract (hidden MSG), carrageenan, dextrose and bleached wheat flour from their Stouffers Lasagna. Ive highlighted the harmful effects of hidden MSG and carrageenan several times in the past and its nice to see companies are starting to remove these unnecessary additives from their products!Schuman introduces True Cheese without cellulose(September 6, 2016)  Schuman introduced a new True Cheese label that verifies a productis made only with milk, cultures, salt and enzymes. This was in response to the scandal regarding alarming amounts of cellulose added to some shredded cheeses.Ground breaking research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems.OctoberJell-O ditches artificial colors in new line (October 5, 2016)  Anew line of Jell-O gelatin and pudding mixes without artificial colors, artificial flavors, or preservatives was released. In 2014, I broke down the toxic ingredients in conventional Jell-O, including artificial colors like yellow #5 that requires a warning label in Europe, and the artificial preservative BHT. The Food Babe Army shared this investigation so much that it was read by millions of people over the last couple years. Informed consumers like usstopped buying JELL-O and look what they had to do! Beware that the old toxic version of JELL-O with artificial colors and BHA is still in stores and this is just a new line that they have created  so continue to check the ingredient list on any product you buy!Buitonigoes non-GMO (October 25, 2016) Buitoni announced that they will remove the GMOs from their pastas and sauces.NovemberCarrageenan to be removed from organic food (November 17, 2016) -The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) declares that carrageenan will no longer be permitted in organic food by 2018. I wrote about this additive in organic food back in 2012, whichis commonly found in almond milks, coconut milks, soy milks, creamers, cottage cheese, ice cream, deli meat, and dozens of other products. Its been shown to be a dangerous and potent inflammatory agent (and possible carcinogen), so it has no business being in our food. This is a HUGE win for consumers. Thanks goes out to The Cornucopia Institute for leading this charge and to everyone who campaigned to make this happen!The Food Babe Army storms the internet! Our most viral blog post of the year with over 5 million viewsexposed the alarming amount of the weedkiller glyphosate found in U.S. foods after it was tested by a FDA registered food safety laboratory, commissioned by Food Democracy Now and The Detox Project.

5,My Favorite Healthy Pregnancy Foods!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/09/28/healthypregnancyfoods/,"Im in the home stretch of my first pregnancy and I thought it would be fun to give you a little insight into what Ive been eating! If youve been following me on social media (Instagram:thefoodbabe & foodbabemama), you know I am a very non-processed organic real food gal! Ive been taking my commitment to staying on track with my eating principles even more seriously while pregnant and even while indulging in the occasional treat. My latest obsession is frozen grapes to curb that sudden sweet tooth Im experiencing this month. Ive never had such a roller coaster of cravings before in my life (I know you other pregnant women can relate!). The first trimester was all things salty and heavy like breads, crackers and pastasand now in my second trimester its salads, vegetables and desserts  I can only imagine what the third trimester will bring with the holidays coming up!While youve got a growing baby inside you, its more important than ever to nourish your body with the right foods. You need to keep yourself healthy while preparing for labor and motherhood, and you also are providing your baby everything it needs to be strong and healthy. In the second trimester, your baby can actually start to taste the food you are eating! Knowing that gives me serious motivation to stay away from controversial food additives and processed foods that screw with your sense of taste or satisfaction!Ive been doing a lot of research into the specific nutrients that I need during pregnancy, and compiled a list here of my favorite pregnancy foods for all of the other new mommas-to-be out there. I also included some of my favorite recipes here too, to make it easy for you to add these foods to your diet.Keep in mind that there are a few foods that pregnant women should avoid like deli meats, raw cheese and some fish and sushi, but, most healthy foods are fair game! Of course, always ask your doctorif there are any specific foods you should be avoiding.New research out of the U.K. is finding a link between mothers who ate a diet of sugary and high-fat processed foods during pregnancy and ADHD in their children.As you probably know, Im already pretty careful about the food I eat and mostly stick to whole unprocessed foods. That being said, there are some specific nutrients that are known to be especially important to eat during pregnancy  so if you arent eating them already, now is the time!My Favorite Foods For Pregnancy:1. Beans & LentilsFolate (a water soluble B vitamin) is one of the most important nutrients to eat if you are either pregnant or hoping to get pregnant. Folate has been shown to protect against neural tube defects in newborns, so many experts advise eating up to 400 to 600 micrograms of folate leading up to and during pregnancy. Instead of eating the synthetic version (folic acid) found fortified cereals and breads, seek out natural sources of folate found in whole foods. Beans and lentils are some of the best natural sources out there, so add them to your meals often! Beans are also high in iron, another crucial nutrient during pregnancy. Your body needs almost twice the amount of iron while you are pregnant and you are at a greater risk of developing anemia or labor and delivery complications when you arent getting enough. This is especially important if you are a vegan or vegetarian!Recipes to try:Chickpea Curry WrapsLentil Detox SaladPumpkin Black Bean ChiliCauliflower Lentil Taco SaladSprouted Lentil Stuffed PeppersGreen ChiliI love lentil pasta from Tolerant  try it at Thrive Market.2. Green DrinksSmoothies and juices made with mostly vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals that help to keep your immune system strong during pregnancy. Folate is also prevalent in most green drinks that are made with leafy greens or beets! Leafy greens like kale and collards are excellent sources of calcium  and if you are a vegan, its especially important to make sure that you are getting enough calcium during pregnancy. Fill up your blender or juicer with greens like romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, and collard greens. Throw some ground flaxseeds into your green smoothies to add an additional boost of folate and nutrients. Warning: Try not to overdo the beet juice, I did that once in my first Trimester and lets just say it did not stay down! Its always good to remember natural foods when juiced can be very potent too.Recipes to try:Anti-Inflammatory SmoothieKickin Kale JuiceCherry Berry SmoothieCabbage Patch Kid JuiceSunrise Green SmoothieBanana Bread Hemp Smoothie (use spinach or romaine for the most folate)3. FigsFigs are amazing for you during pregnancy, as they are rich sources of folate, calcium, and iron  all especially important nutrients to eat during pregnancy. The vitamin K in figs is helpful for proper blood clotting, which is necessary during childbirth and helps you to recover. Figs are said to have a sedative effect on your mood, so they can help to keep you feeling happy and positive during your pregnancyoh yeah! They are also packed with fiber to help keep things moving.  Recipe to try:Fig Newton SaladTry stuffing a dried fig with a walnut for a quick snack4. Chia SeedsChia seeds are packed with omega-3 fatty acids (more than any other plant food). You may want to limit or avoid eating fish during pregnancy due to its mercury content, but you still need to make sure youre getting your omega-3s! Your body can convert the type of omega-3s in chia seeds (AHA) to make DHA, which growing babies need for healthy brain development. Chia seeds keep you full by slowing down your digestion and help to keep your blood sugar in check. Chia seeds are also high in antioxidants and very high in minerals like calcium and iron, of which your body requires more of during pregnancy. Recipes to try:Chia Seed Fruit SaladPeach Chia Green SmoothieApple Pie Chia Pudding5. CoconutAll forms of coconut (water, milk, oil, meat) are super good for you during pregnancy! Coconuts (especially the water) provide both calcium and magnesium, which are essential for the developing baby  and if you dont eat enough, your body will take it from your bones putting you at risk for osteoporosis. Coconut water is also excellent for replenishing your body if youre experiencing morning sickness. Some people swear that the electrolytes in coconut water can also alleviate painful leg swelling during pregnancy.Coconut oil is antiviral and boosts your immunity to help keep you from getting sick, and the fat will help your body process fat-soluble vitamins to give you and your baby more nutrition from the foods you eat. Applying the oil to your growing belly can also prevent stretch marks. Coconuts are full of lauric acid, which can enhance your breast milk after you deliver your baby. Fresh coconut is always best, but when buying packaged versions choose organic products that are minimally processed without sugar and additives. Check out my buying tips for coconut water, coconut milk, and oils before you head to the store.

Fresh GingerHere Im talking about fresh ginger root  not supplements! It can be dangerous to take ginger supplements during pregnancy because they are so potent, and you would want to ask your doctor before taking supplements or eating fresh ginger to be on the safe side. Its been shown that fresh ginger is likely safe during pregnancy as long as you dont overdo it  and can be really beneficial. Ginger can help to relieve morning sickness. It also increases your circulation and supplies your body with iron and vitamin C. Recipes to try:One-Ingredient Ginger TeaClassic Real Ginger CookiesHomemade Real Ginger AleCandied Ginger7. Carrots (and other orange produce like Mangos!)The beta-carotene (provitamin A) in thesehelp your growing baby develop healthy eyes and organs. It also helps to prepare your body for childbirth because it helps with postpartum tissue repair  so, make sure to eat lots of thesewhen you are close to your due date! The magnesium in mangos are also a useful remedy for leg cramps.Recipes to try:Hummus Mezze Plate With Carrot SticksMango LassiProtein Rich Carrot Ginger Lentil SoupRoasted Beet & Carrot Salad8. Fresh BasilIt seems so simple, but this delicious herb is packed with nutrients that your pregnant body needs like iron, calcium, and folate. Fresh basil is also rich in numerous vitamins and other minerals that help to keep you from getting sick. Just make sure you pick up the fresh basil leaves (and not the dried version in jars) from the store. Its also super easy to grow at home in a sunny window. The easiest way to add this to your diet is to throw some into a green salad or you could layer it over slices of tomatoes and drizzle with balsamic vinegar.Recipes to try: Creamy Avocado & Sweet Pea PastaVegetable Lasagne With No NoodlesMini Vegetable Frittatas9. AvocadosAvocados are one of the richest sources of vitamin B6, which helps relieve morning sickness in some people. This vitamin is also excellent for proper brain development in the womb. Avocados are also loaded with folate, potassium and vitamin C.Recipes to try:Quinoa Avocado TacosAvocado Berry Banana Breakfast SmoothieCoconut Avocado FriesAvocado & Carrot Salad10.Pumpkin SeedsWhen you are pregnant your body produces more red blood cells to help your baby grow, and thats why its important to eat enough iron everyday. Pumpkin seeds are one of the best sources of iron, along with folate and omega 3 fatty acids to help with fetal brain development.These are easy to add to your diet. You can snack on them, throw them in smoothies, or top salads with them.Recipes to try:Kale Slaw SaladPapaya Pineapple Protein Smoothie11. Fermented Foods and PrebioticsProbiotics and prebiotics are both important and Im glad folks are starting to learn more about why you need healthy bacteria in your gut. In Chinese Medicine, they believe that most diseases start from the gut. Its all about whether or not your healthy bacteria can crowd out the bad. The fermentation process increases the nutritional value of food. Many fermented foods are good sources of K2 (a vitamin that is rare in most diets and good for your baby) and B vitamins, including B-12.I love to add fermented veggies (like kimchi) to my plate almost everyday.I also take a probiotic everyday first thing in the morning for my insurance that I have a belly full of good bacteria. You can find it in the refrigerator section at vitamins stores or natural food markets and make sure to choose one with an enteric coating that allows the pill to slowly be absorbed by your body throughout the day.Its also essential to regularly eat foods that naturally contain Prebiotics  this is the stuff that feeds the good bacteria thats already in your gut and helps it to grow. Prebiotic-rich foods include whole foods like radishes, bananas, onions, garlic, leeks, radicchio, asparagus, artichokes, and legumes.Recipes to try:Homemade YogurtKimchiMiso SoupAsparagus Lemon Quinoa RisottoAsparagus Hazelnut Salad12. Wild Fish (low-mercury varieties)  Salmon, Trout, Sardines, Shrimp andHerringSome in the nutrition world opt to completely eliminate fish from their diets while pregnant and go for a supplement instead. But Ive read about too many positive reasons to eat low-mercury fish twice a week for a growing baby. For example in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores. And this becomes even more important when you are breastfeeding after the baby is born too. One rule of thumb  I avoid the highest mercury fish like the plague  Tuna, Marlin, Shark, Swordfish, etc. Recipes to try:Wild Salmon Cakes With Fresh ArugulaThe Best Salmon EverI have to admit, it was hard limiting this list to just 12! There are so many more amazingly delicious foods that are healthy to eat during pregnancy (or anytime!) so these are just some of my personal favorites. If you havent tried any of thembefore, I hope this motivates youto try something new!If you know anyone who is pregnant (or is trying to be), sharethis post to them.Heres to all of us having healthy and happy pregnancies!Xo,Vani14.1K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

6,Protein Powder To Never Buy Again (And What To Choose Instead)!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/08/25/protein-powders-to-never-buy-again-and-what-to-choose-instead/,"I get a lot of questions about protein shakes and powders. Many of you want to know if I drink them, which brands I recommend, what types of protein are the best, which ones to avoidetc.The truth is that most protein powders on the market are filled with highly processed denatured proteins, preservatives, GMOs, and tons of additives. Many areso expensive but also at the same time can be some of the lowest quality ingredients you can buy!Let me give you an example of a protein powderthat I would NEVER buyEAS Soy Protein Powder: Soy Protein Isolate, Fructose, Cocoa Powder (Processed with Alkali), Natural & Artificial Flavor, and Soy Lecithin.This protein powder is not certified organic or non-GMO project verified  so it can contain GMO ingredients. The soy likely comes from Roundup Ready soybeans (a GMO) that is engineered to be doused with Monsantos herbicide glyphosate.The World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer deemed glyphosate probably carcinogenic  This is definitely not something you should be supplementing your diet with!Besides being GMO, I avoid soy protein because when soy is isolated to just its protein state it becomes denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions. It also endures an extreme amount of chemical processing to become isolated  so it is not what I consider real food.Heres another popular one I wouldnt buyIsoPure Zero Carb Protein (Vanilla): Ion Exchange Whey [Milk] Protein Isolate, Microfiltered Whey [Milk] Protein Isolate, Vitamin/Mineral/Amino Acid Blend, (Taurine, Potassium [As Potassium Chloride], Chloride [As Potassium And Sodium Chloride], Calcium [As Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate], Phosphorus [As Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate], L-Glutamine, Magnesium [As Magnesium Oxide], Vitamin C [As Ascorbic Acid], Vitamin E [As DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate], Niacin, Zinc [As Zinc Sulfate Dihydrate], Vitamin A [As Palmitate], Pantothenic Acid [As D-Calcium Pantothenate], Vitamin B6 [As Pyridoxine Hydrochloride], Copper [As Amino Acid Chelate], Manganese [As Manganese Sulfate Dihydrate], Riboflavin, Thiamin [As Thiamin Hydrochloride], Folic Acid, Biotin, Iodide [As Potassium Iodide], Chromium [As Amino Acid Chelate], Vitamin K, Molybdenum [As Amino Acid Chelate], Selenium [As Amino Acid Chelate], Vitamin B12), Soy Lecithin, Natural And Artificial Flavors, Xanthan Gum, Sucralose.This artificially flavored protein powder is made from whey protein that is not certified organic, so it likely comes from cows that were raised on GMOs, growth hormones, antibiotics and other drugs. It also contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (Splenda) which is linked to leukemia. The Center for Science in the Public Interest says sucralose is not safe and should be avoided.This next protein powder seems pretty clean, but I still wouldnt buy itVega One Nutritional Shake (French Vanilla): Pea protein, whole flaxseed (micro-milled), organic acacia gum (naturally occurring fiber), hemp protein, SaviSeedTM (sacha inchi) protein, organic gelatinized maca root, organic broccoli, inulin (from chicory root), organic spirulina, organic kale, organic marine algae calcium, fruit & vegetable blend (spinach, broccoli, carrot, beet, tomato, apple, cranberry, orange, blueberry and/or bilberry, strawberry, shiitake mushroom), chlorella vulgaris (cracked whole cell), papaya extract, probiotics (bacillus coagulans [provides 1 billion cfu/serving]), antioxidant fruit blend (grape seed extract, organic pomegranate, aai, mangosteen, organic goji, organic maqui), Contains 2 percent or less of: natural vanilla flavor, natural caramel flavor, stevia extract, citric acid.This shake is not certified organic, including the first two ingredients, which means that they may have been treated with synthetic pesticides. Roundup herbicide is also used as a desiccant (drying agent) on some non-organic peas and flaxseed crops. Since I try to avoid these chemicals, I choose certified organic foods whenever possible! This powder is also sweetened with stevia extract (instead of whole stevia leaf), which goes through a chemical-laden process.I cant tell you how many times Ive been askedto review this next shake (a lot!) and again, this is one that I wouldnt buyIsagenix IsaLean Shake (Strawberry Cream): Exclusive Myo-IsaLean Complex [whey protein concentrate (undenatured), milk protein concentrate (undenatured), low heat nonfat dry milk], isomaltooligosaccharide powder, fructose, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oil powder, natural strawberry flavors, olive (Olea europaea) oil powder, tapioca maltodextrin, flax (Linum usitatissimum) seed powder, xanthan gum, medium chain triglyceride oil powder, Ionic Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) leaf extract, natural flavors, beet juice powder, magnesium oxide, tricalcium phosphate, potassium citrate, enzyme blend [lactase (from Aspergillus oryzae), lipase (from Rhizopus oryzae), cellulase (from Trichoderma longibrachiatum), invertase (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), protease (from Aspergillus oryzae), amylase (from Bacillus subtilis), bromelain (from Ananas comosus), papain (from Carica papaya), acid stable protease (from Aspergillus niger)], magnesium citrate, sea salt, stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) leaf extract, silicon dioxide, yucca (Yucca schidigera) root powder, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), magnesium stearate, psyllium (Plantago ovata) seed powder, biotin, selenium amino acid chelate, vitamin E succinate, copper amino acid chelate, vitamin A (beta carotene), zinc oxide, manganese amino acid chelate, iodine amino acid chelate, niacinamide, d-calcium pantothenate, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), chromium amino acid chelate, niacin, molybdenum amino acid chelate, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine HCl), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), riboflavin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, thiamine HCl, folic acid.This protein powder is not organic! Although Isagenix claimsthey make every effort not to use GMOs, this shake is not Non-GMO Project Verified or certified organic so there is a chance that some of the ingredients (such as the fructose) are derived from GMOs. While their website statestheir whey comes from New Zealand cows fed on a pasture, they readily admit, we have also sought other suppliers in Australia and the U.S. who meet the same standards for dairy protein.Without the certified organic orcertified grassfed label, there is the possibility that the cows were raised with some GMO feed. The amount of sugar in this shake is pretty high too at 11 grams per serving, which is almost 3 teaspoons! Although this powder is filled with vitamins and minerals, these dont come directly from real food. The ingredients within the natural flavors in this shake are not identified on the label. Flavors can contain up to 100 ingredients, including synthetic chemicals such as the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA as well as GMO-derived ingredients.Another twoI get asked about all the time that arent organic eitherShakeology (Greenberry): Proprietary Superfood Blend, Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate (milk), Pea protein, Flax (seed), Chia (seed), Quinoa (seed)), Chlorella (whole plant), Pea fiber (seed), Spirulina, Yacon (root), Cordyceps (fungi), Camu-Camu (fruit), Acerola cherry (fruit), Chicory fiber (root), Spinach leaf, Pomegranate (fruit), Astragalus (fruit), Bilbury (fruit), Blueberry (fruit), Lycium berry (fruit), Maitake (fungi), Reishi (fungi), Rose hips (fruit), MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), Ashwagandha (root), Enzyme Blend (Amylase, Cellulase, Lactase, Glucoamylace, Alpha-galactosidase, Invertase, Kale (leaf), Lactobacillus sporogenes, Shisandra (fruit), Maca (root), Luo Han Guo (fruit), Cinnamon (bark), Green tea extract (leaf), Moringa (leaf), Sacha inchi (seed), Other ingredients (non-GMO Fructose, Xanthan Gum, Natural Strawberry Flavor (with other natural flavors), Citric acid, Himalayan salt, Stevia extract (leaf).Thisshake is also not certified organic or Non-GMO Project Verified, but even ifall the ingredients are non-GMO, there is a BIG difference between organic and non-GMO ingredients  These ingredients can still contain synthetic pesticides and thats why I choose certified organic foods whenever possible. This is especially important if you are drinking a protein shake daily, as many people do! The whey is also isolated, which is a heavily processed form and is not the best way to consume it.Arbonne Vanilla Protein Shake Mix:Protein Matrix Blend (pea protein isolate, cranberry protein, rice protein), sugar cane, sunflower oil, natural vanilla flavor, inulin, maltodextrin, flax seed, stevia leaf extract, xanthan gum, gum acacia, guar gum.This protein isnt certified organic or Non-GMO Project Verified  which is the first reason to not to use this powder. Its also sweetened with stevia extract, which to me, leaves an odd after taste in your mouth, and they add several gums which are not necessary.You can still supplement with protein and avoid heavily processed protein powders like these!I typically prefer to make protein smoothies from scratch with real nutrient-dense foods  but this is not always the most convenient option. I realize there are times when you just need to whip up a quick protein shake and run out the door or want something while traveling  without worrying about poisoning yourself with unnecessary chemicals. Now that I am pregnant, I need extra protein for my growing baby, but want to make sure I am getting it from the safest sources.Its important to note that I dont like consuming additional no-calorie sweeteners like stevia extract and erythritol on a daily basis. The extra sweet sensation screws with my taste buds and Id rather have my daily drinks sweetened with fruit and other natural sources that dont mess with myhunger signals.Thats why I love Nutivas brand new protein powder: Organic Plant Protein Superfood 30 Shake.Nutivas shake is made from certified organic whole food plant proteins  no processed whey or isolated soy and contains 20 grams of protein per serving. This shake is a blend of organic pea, pumpkin, sunflower, chia, hemp and sacha inchi proteins, along with 30 superfoods including reishi mushroom, baobab, moringa, kale, hawthorn berry, purple corn, sea buckthorn, kelp and cinnamon.It also tastes amazing, despite having no fake flavors, nasty chemical additives, and only 2g of sugar per serving. Unlike other protein manufacturersthatnever tell you whatsin their natural or organic flavors, Nutiva uses a vanilla organic flavor where they actually list whats in it  vs. hiding it! All of these ingredients areORGANIC too  so they are not using Roundup-Ready GMO corn andthey use all organic ingredients to make the carriers for the flavors! This is a huge deal, not just with transparency, but the high level quality of each ingredient they choose. Also note  the sugars in the product come mostly from plants and fruits  not added sugaror stevia (which I think makes most protein powders taste kinda too sweet and some nasty!)Im so happy that Nutivaformulated the BEST plant protein powder out there!Do you know someone still consuming protein powders with terrible ingredients? If so, please share this post with them and spread the word!Xo,VaniP.S. Still confused on protein powders? Remember, if your protein powder is not certified organic, its not worth putting it in your body  especially on a regular basis.

7,Does Your Body Cleanse Itself? Is Detoxing Really A Myth?,http://foodbabe.com/2016/08/16/does-your-body-cleanse-itself-is-detoxing-really-a-myth/,"How many times have you heard on the Internet or from an expert on TV, theres no such thing as detoxing, theres no SCIENCE behind it and your body cleanses itself? If youve questioned the word detox like many out there, then you definitely want to read this, and then decide for yourself if what they are leading you to believe is true or not.What do you think it REALLYmeans to be healthy? Does it mean that you are not sick? Does it simply mean the absence of diseaseor does being healthy mean so much more than that? Could being healthymean that not only are you NOT sick, but you are thriving, happy, and full of energy?Im sure many of you agree that there is so much more to being healthy than just the absence of health problems, especially since these usually take years to surface and can remain hidden for long time. In my personal life, not only have I been able to get off of several prescription medications for eczema, asthma and allergies, but I feel better and healthier than ever!But what if I didnt do anything to change my diet? What if I just believed the experts who said your body detoxes naturally  and theres nothing you can do to make it detox any faster or better. What if I just listened to their advice and trusted that my body was going to be able to continue to detox itself just fine from all the soda, fast food and candy I was eating filled with a slew of controversial synthetic additives, pesticides and plasticizer chemicals from the packaging material  not to mention the daily exposure of suspect chemicals in water, air and the environment I was being exposed to  ?I suppose I could have just stayed hopped up on medicine, just surviving the days, walking around like a zombie!One thing is clear, we might not be able to see toxins, but they are there!Hearing the breaking news that the government has approvedaerial spraying of a chemical that is banned in Europe all over Florida that is linked toneurological disorders and defects in the wombreally opened my eyes. This pesticide  Naled  is moderately to highly toxic whichdegrades into dichlorvos,classified by the EPA as a probable carcinogen. Repeatedexposures to Naled over time may result in the same effects as acute exposuresuch asrespiratoryproblems,vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, slurred speech, twitching, paralysis, convulsions and coma. Its alarming that this toxic pesticide is routinely being sprayed all over our communities(not just in Florida) to kill mosquitoes  but this is just one example of what our regulatory bodies allow us to beexposed to on a daily basis.Varying amounts of toxic chemicals pesticides, heavy metals, parabens, fertilizers, herbicides, and mold  are consumed by our bodies during normal everyday life. Many of theseset up shop in the body for months or years(sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and are showing up in human urine and blood tests.So how do they endup in our bodies?Many of them come frompesticide-sprayed food, farmed fish, and food packaging materials. Besides the food we eat, everyday items like shampoo, household cleaners, plastic bottles, clothing, furniture, water, and even the air we breathe are all possible sources of toxin exposure. It has been estimated that theaverage person could be harboring about 500 synthetic chemicals in their bodies, and one study found that unborn babies had over 200 toxins in their umbilical cord blood this amount of toxins is no joke!What is a toxin?When I say the word toxin, I am talking about a substance that is harmfulto the body after either after a single exposure(acute) or repeated exposures over time (chronic). While we may not find ourselves at the scene of anaccidental chemical leak (which would be acute exposure), all of usare being chronically exposed tolow-levels of synthetic chemicals repeatedly, day after day. Low-level chronicexposures to synthetic chemicals over time have been shown to have a negative impact on health. (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).An unprecedented alliance of 48 of the nations top scientists recently came to a consensusthat thescientific evidence supports a link between exposures to toxic chemicals in our environment (which specifically includeorganophosphate pesticidesthatare sprayed on non-organic food)andneurodevelopmental disorders in children, such asautism and learning disabilities. They are calling out thechemical industry to prove a chemical is safe, rather than waiting on the medical and scientific community to prove it is harmfulandaskingthat food companies get these toxins out of their supply chains so that pregnant women and children are no longer exposed.The problem is that your body cant easily eliminatemany of these toxinsor break them down. They get stored in places like fat tissue and eventually make their way through your bloodstream and invade your brain, lungs, heart, eyes, stomach, liver, and sexual organs. Heavy metals are particularly toxic to your brain cells, where they can cause memory loss, migraines, and premature brain aging.Anyone who eats, drinks, breathes is being exposed to these toxins, we cant escape them. While this isntsomething to livein fear of, we shouldnt pretend that its no big deal and hope that our body will take care of these toxins for us automatically. When you look at the increasing amountschemicals invading our environment, doesnt it just make sense to do whatever we can to mitigate the damage?Sure, its true that our bodies are designed with the natural ability to detox  but that isnt the whole story.Our kidneys, liver, cardiovascular system, and skin are all working hard every day to process all of the substances that come into the body and to expel toxins but they are being pushed to the brink. Even when we eat a good diet and surround ourselves with a healthy environment, the natural system in the body needs help. When our organs are overtaxed and overburdened with toxins, symptoms can creep up such as fatigue, digestion problems, bloating, and muscle aches (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and while we may appear healthy, this is not the true health that Im talking about! When these symptoms go unchecked and our bodies are not able to detox optimally, we are at risk for greater health problems down the road. (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).This goes against the mainstream idea that our bodies can process all of the toxins that we are exposed to throughout our lives without any intervention on our part. Many doctors and scientistshave been known to say, your body can handle toxins on its own and that detoxing is a myth  I know youve heard these claims before as they are prevalent in the media.Which drink or food helps your liver work more efficiently? A couple of shots of vodka or green juice? A McDonalds Super Sized Meal or pasture raised chicken with vegetables? I think you know the answer.An article published in the New York Timesearlier this year is a perfect example of how many of the experts quoted in the media paint a different picture and steer people away from the belief that food has any ability to help you detox from poisons.Dr. James H. Grendell is quoted as saying: The human body is well designed to eliminate wastes and toxins, and a number of organs play a role there is no good scientific evidence that a juice cleanse, or any other food for that matter, is particularly relevant to removing toxins.No good scientific evidence? Thats BS!This article really got under my skinbecause Ive seen that there is good evidence that certain foods have remarkable powers and are capable of helping your body flush toxins. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine have used detoxification and purification techniques for centuries continuing on to today  healing foods, massage, herbs, and fasting  this is not somefad.Just a few examples of how foods can help you detoxGarlic and onions are high in sulfurandcompounds that help to remove heavy metals from the bodyand can also prevent kidney damagecaused by exposure.(sources:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) These sulfur-rich foods also help your body produce more glutathione, acritical antioxidant whichlatches onto and carries toxins out of the body(sources: 1, 2).Chlorella (a type of green algae) helps your body eliminateof mercury stored in yourgastrointestinal tract, muscles and bones. If youve never eaten this before, you can try adding it to a green drink!Vitamin B1, which isnaturally foundin peas, spinach, and pistachios, increases the excretion of lead from the body.Likewise, diets with sufficient vitamin B1inhibitsleadabsorption and correlates withlower levels of lead in the blood.Sunflower seeds, avocados,and almondsare high in Vitamin E, an antioxidant shown toprotect the body from methylmercury (sources 1, 2, 3). Avocados in particular canimprove the health of your liver (your bodys primary detoxing organ).Calcium-rich foods like collard greens and almonds protect your body from lead becausemore lead isabsorbed by people on a calcium-poor diet.Lemon juice stimulates the liver and helps your body flush out toxins. (sources: 1, 2).The vitamin C in lemon juiceis alsoused by the body to produce glutathione.(sources: 1, 2, 3, 4)Thats why I do this every morning!Garbanzobeans (chickpeas) and pumpkin seedsare high in zinc, a mineralshown toprotect the kidneysfrom cadmium and caneliminate the symptoms of cadmium toxicity. (sources 1, 2, 3)Cilantro (also called Chinese parsley) enhances your bodys ability to detox from heavy metals such as lead and mercury. (sources 1, 2) It also has been shown to effectively purify drinking water that is contaminated with these toxins!The lactic acid bacteria in kimchi (my favorite fermented food) has been shown to degrade the presence of pesticides. Probiotics also help to protect the body from BPA exposure, and also to detox from heavy metals and cancerous nitrosamines.Beets and milk thistle bothhelp to keep the liver healthy so that it can do its job toremove toxins from the blood. (sources 1, 2, 3)Simply drinking plenty of filtered water every day (not fromplastic bottles!) helps your body eliminate toxins by keeping your kidneys and bowels active.Somethingas basic as fiberin our food helpsto remove toxic waste from the body (sources:1,2)All of us can naturally keep our bodys detox system running optimally at very little cost or effort.The average person doesntneed some fancysupplement or expensive prescription, you can simply eat whole real foods that support the detoxprocess, while avoiding things that are known to tax the liver such as toxic cookingoils (soybean, corn, canola) and sugar.Juicing is an easy way to keep your organs working optimally!There are specific foods that I eat every day to help my body detox  besides drinking lemon water first thing in the morning, I like to add detoxifying ingredientslike dandelion greens, cilantro, and parsley to my salads and green drinks. Juicing is one way that I provide my body with a rich source of nutrients and give my digestive organs a rest.Ive been on several green juice fasts in my life  and I come out feeling better and healthier than ever! I even put together my plan for others to try, because it is so effective you can check it out here.Eating organic can reduce exposure to synthetic chemicals that overtax your bodys natural ability to cleanse Ieatfresh organic produce withevery meal.Choosing organic food helps me avoid organophosphate pesticidesandother hazardouschemicals.My health changed dramatically when I changed my eating habits and started filling my body with organic raw whole foods from all of the colors of the rainbow  leafy greens, red beets, orange carrots, purple cabbage, blueberries as varied as possible! It is no accident that my health improved because there is ample scientific evidence that these types of foods help support the detox process and provideoptimal health!The absolute best thing about eating this way is that the food industry hasnt adulterated your food with industrial chemicals that you need to detox from  artificial colors, flavors, chemicals, pesticides, additives, preservatives, or BPA and other harmful packaging materials. Meal planning and cooking at home with whole real foods is one of the best ways to stay alkaline, provide your body an abundant amount of nutrients on a daily basis, and prevent disease.If you want help eating this way, I invite you to join the Food Babe Eating Guide Program.

8,The Time I Almost Ate At Taco Bell… (I’ve Been Keeping A Tiny Little Secret!),http://foodbabe.com/2016/07/18/secret/,"I am thrilled to announce we are expecting our own little Food Babe this winter.I know all you moms and dads out there have been waiting for this moment for a long time I laugh just thinking about all the times you said to me Just wait, until you have kidsWell  that time is almost here and you can finally get all your I told ya sos ready to fire!No, but seriously, we are SO EXCITED. Its been really hard to keep this secret from you! Ive been walking around with a ridiculous smile on my face for months trying to hold it in.Im obsessed! Baby investigations are underway! Ive been reading every natural pregnancy and baby book under the sun for the past several months.How it happenedWell I am not going to go into all the exact details (Ill let you use your imagination  haha) but late last year, I knew I was finally ready to be a Mom. My parents werent getting any younger, Mr. Food Babe and I were about to celebrate 10 years of marriage and the more I thought about my role in this life, I knew I really wanted to bring another force for good into the world. I have so many hopes for her  to be brave, confident, powerful, smart and have lots of tenacity!When I looked at my husband and said I was ready, things happened quick. BOOM. I was pregnant. I honestly couldnt believe it  I thought it would take a long time considering all the pregnancy stories and experiences I have heard about with loved ones and close friends, but I am incredibly grateful that it happened so easily for us. We are truly blessed  I cant help but think the years of getting my health to its optimal state had to help  practicing my healthy habits, regular acupuncture and staying away from processed food!Ive never been more hungry in my life! Now that I am pregnant  wow  have my eating habits changed. First of all, not in a million years did I think I would ever crave Taco Bell again. But it happened. I was walking by one on the way to another restaurant and I could literally taste a chicken soft taco and bean burrito in my mouth. Of course I didnt get any  But man! It was the weirdest sensation I have ever experienced, especially considering I havent eaten at Taco Bell since it was like 2am in the morning and I was in college.And then Burger King happened. Yes. That nasty excuse for food. I was in Spain (of all places!) promoting the Spanish version of The Food Babe Way and was stuck in an airport terminal with the smell of charbroiled hamburgers radiating the whole waiting area. I thought I was going to DIE if I didnt have one. But thankfully my years of personal investigation and study of food toxins and industrial factory farming kept me FAR FAR away  there was no way I was going to feed my growing baby that tainted meat on that processed to death sesame seed bun!As you can see, my pregnancy cravings have been INTENSE! To tame them, Ive spent a lot of time making organic comfort food at home  Ive made just about all my childhood favorites  grilled cheese, biscuits, pancakes and more. (Have you seen all the cooking on Snapchat? Follow me at thefoodbabe).I have heard most mamas stop enjoying green vegetables during this time  thankfully that is not the case for me, I still LOVE kale and all things green (with a slice of hot cheese pizza please  haha). Actually my Melt In Your Mouth Kale Salad has been on serious repeat lately and is the one dish that doesnt give me the pregnancy burbs! Ill be sharing some more of the comfort food recipes Ive been making soon.Follow Food Babe Mama On Instagramfor pregnancy & baby updates.I have so many more pregnancy stories to share. Like in true Food Babe fashion, I have been reading every book under the sun to prepare for this moment and cant wait to share all the good health principles I am putting in place.If youd like to follow along on my pregnancy journey, Ill be sharing my insights here on occasion but also more frequently on my new Instagram account  Food Babe Mama  come on over and follow me there!Pregnancy Q&A Coming  Let Me Know Your Questions!Also  I know there are many of you mamas and dads out there that might have questions for me and wondering how I am handling all the ins and outs of child bearing, so Ill be doing periodic Pregnancy Q&As. If you have a question youd like to have the answer to, just let me know in the comments below.This is such a wonderful time in my life  thank you for being part of this community, celebrating with us and for all your love and support!Xo,Vani15 weeks pregnant51.6K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

9,"She Gave Up Processed Food, And WHOA! Look At Her Results!",http://foodbabe.com/2016/06/02/she-gave-up-processed-food-and-whoa-look-at-her-results/,"A couple weeks ago I received an email from Shannon, a reader of my bookThe Food Babe Way,and my jaw dropped to the floor! In just the past few months, Shannon has made an incredible transformation toher body  she wentdown 5 sizes in 4 months, but what I think is most important is that her health and fitness has improved dramatically. I am so excitedshe wants to share her story with you.Shannons storyjust goes to show how quickly you can change your body even if nothing else worked for you in the past and that you can still enjoy amazingly delicious food all day, every day!She told my team that she hopes others can relate to her story and that maybe it will inspire them to know that it can be done. I reallylove that she wants to help others, and I am so happy for her and all she has accomplished! Are youready to be inspired?The Before picture that Shannon sent in was taken sometime prior to January 2016 (when she began eating The Food Babe Way) and the After pictures were taken in May 2016:Shannons story:In the beginning: When I was in my teens and early 20s I competed in pageantseven winning swimsuit awards at a few state competitions. Fat-free was all the rage then and I prided myself on eating less than 5 grams of fat a day during competition season. I was muscular, 56 and 125 lbs. Losing weight wasnt easy, but it wasnt hard either back then. I love a lot of diverse foods, but gave up a lot when competing. When I joined the workforce I challenged myself with a job that required a yearly fitness testpush-ups, sit-ups, waist measurement and a timed run. While the amount of my physical activity has ebbed and flowed throughout the years, it has always been a part of my life.What happened: As I moved into my late 20s and early 30s it became harder. I worked out daily, but was still 20 lbs more than when I competed. Folks said thats what happened with age. I was still within my BMI though and felt good, but always had to have a daily nap! When I got married in my early 30s I maintained my weight until I had children. I put on 25 lbs while pregnant, but 25 lbs never came off. Sure, some of it did, but as most new moms can relate it was a struggle. For years I teetered between a normal BMI and what doctors consider overweight. It was frustrating.In 2010, I started actively running, about 4-5 miles a day. I used a stand-up desk because I read it burned 500 extra calories a day. I also started a healthy eating routinewhole grain breads and pastas, yogurt, oatmeal, low-fat dairy, soups, fruits and vegetables. I often had a Lean Cuisine, Weight Watchers or Healthy Choice for lunch. I mean just look at the nameshow could these meals not be good for me? When I traveled for work I ate at Subway. I got back to an acceptable BMI, but that only lasted about 7 months and the scale started to go up again.I remember at my yearly physical I told my doctor about my daily running routine and my healthy diet. When she said, You might have a thyroid issue, I thought YES! Something that explains it. First off, what crazy logic is that to get excited about a possible illness to explain weight gain! Thank God, I did not have a thyroid issue, but what was happening?In 2013, I took on a new, more stressful position, but still went to the gym. I drank coffee with creamer like a fiend in the morning and drank a glass or two of wine at night to unwind. Store bought French bread became a staple at every meal. I always tried to balance the plate with a meat, starch and vege, but again the numbers on the scale kept climbing. I also must admit I have a sweet tooth, but a bit of Dove, Hersheys or M&Ms always seemed to satisfy it. In 2014, we had a British soccer coach stay at our home. We went to the grocery store to buy food for his lunches. He couldnt believe all the choices we had. He told me how many of the foods here were outlawed in England. I thought it was interesting, but didnt give too much more thought to it as I took him through a McDonalds drive thru later that day.By 2015 I had gained all my baby weight back. I was 15 lbs over my BMI and officially dubbed overweight. I felt tired, stressed, unhappy with my appearance and hopeless. In Dec. 2015 I gave away a ton of size 8 clothes thinking Id never, ever be able to wear them again since I had not been able to wear them since 2010.A new chapter: In late 2015, a friend told me about an M.D./nutritionist she was seeing. I quickly made an appointment for after the New Year. On Jan. 7, 2016 I met Dr. B. and she talked to me about gluten and casein allergies, GMOs, glycemic index, organic foods and foods dubbed healthy that would actually sabotage weight loss. I had never heard about GMOs! She gave me a daily caloric plan, recipes, shopping lists and supplements to help me as I changed my eating habits.That weekend we had a snowstorm, so I binge watched every Netflix film I could find on food. FedUp, Food, Inc, Cowspiracy, Forks over Knives, SuperSize Meyep I watched them all. FedUp and Food, Inc. really hit home. I was shocked to learn what Big Food was doing to our food and what little the FDA was doing to protect us. I went through my pantry and got rid of boxed rice and pasta sides. I swapped out whole grain wheat pastas for brown rice, corn and quinoa. I made a few changes, but my low-fat cereals stayed, my Chunky soups stayed, my lunch meats stayedas did many other products that I thought were healthy. In fact, I bought more Gatorade Power Bars for my son. The packaging said 20 grams of protein. We kept the Carnation Breakfast drinks with 11 vitamins and minerals. That stuff had to be good for you right? I mean, the packaging said so.For as long as Ive known my best friend shes always been into food and fitness. She is a wealth of knowledge and an inspiration. When I shared with her my new knowledge she told me about Food Babe. I looked at the Facebook page and was intrigued. I went to the library to get the book. Im not a fast reader, but that book went with me to every soccer game, baseball practice, and carpool line I went to. I knew half-way through that I had to order my own copy. I wanted to dog-ear it, highlight it, tab it.By the middle of the book I was back in my kitchen pantry. I spent three days reading EVERY LABEL in my kitchen. By the third night I wanted to sit on the floor and cry. All these foods I was feeding to my kids were loaded with TBHQ, BHA, hidden MSG, sugar, sugar and more sugar. If I didnt recognize an ingredient I looked it up on the internet. The vast majority were not good. For me, the light bulb went on. This wasnt healthy food. My body had no idea how to process it. It was making me sick and fat and was causing who-knows-what damage to my kids. I did another clean out and started looking for other alternatives to baked crackers, granola bars and peanut butter.I must tell readers that Ive been through my pantry and freezer at least six or seven times. Food has an emotional pull either because we are addicted to the taste or we cant wrap our minds around the cost of getting rid of it. My taste buds started to change after the first month, but my wallet still cringed at the thought that I had just bought a club-price pack of turkey bacon and years supply of Eggo waffles (Ok, not really a year, but certainly a months worthmaybe two).The turning point came as I started to see the scale go lower and lower each week. Pounds were coming off like crazy! Real food tasted great. I was cooking and finding new recipes to satisfy my needs and my sweet tooth (Yep, Babes Almond Butter Fudge recipe rocks!) I remember I left for a business trip and my husband found the last pack of frozen, processed lunch meat. When I came home I was so disgusted by it that I immediately threw it away. He came home a few days later looking for it as I feigned like I didnt hear him ask me, What happened to the lunch meat? I finally had to confess that I threw it away. It wasnt good for any of us. I promised to make an organic chicken weekly so that he would have lunch meat.When I went to the gym I talked to people who looked fit and healthy. Fitness instructors are a wealth of knowledge, as are many people who take their classes. Id ask a question during class about food and get three or four varying answers all good answers that would lead me to a new recipe, or gadget or better, cleaner way of living my life. All the instructors said that changing your body was 20 percent exercise and 80 percent food. WOW were they right! I started seeing muscles and definition in my arms and legs from only lifting five to eight pound weights. I went from wearing my husbands t-shirts and baggy running pants to buying cute, matching yoga outfits (a reward for meeting each new weight goal).When my copy of The Food Babe Way came in March I was close to reaching my initial goal weight35 lbs less than when I started. I wanted to be the weight I was when I got married and fit into some adorable jeans my husband bought me that I hadnt worn in years (a pair of size 8s I just couldnt bring myself to donate). I decided to order a few more copiesone for my doctor, one for my fitness coach, one for my sister and a few spares for special gifts. Im trying to follow the 21-day plan and do pretty well at it. A few things took me some attempts the lemon/cayenne water didnt stick right away, but I tried again after a week or so and have been on it for nearly two months now. I cant imagine not starting my morning without it.I recently went to a hibachi-style restaurant and didnt read the book before going. I knew the hibachi was out when I asked the cook, Do you have brown rice? And was told, Umm well we have white rice and we put soy sauce on that and it makes it brown. Every question I asked about what they were putting on the meat to the bananas was answered as a joke. I ordered sushi knowing it wasnt that great of an option either. I swore off that restaurant that night. I was saddened to learn our state farmers market doesnt sell organic, so I make treks to Whole Foods and order from online services I read about in the book. I still havent been able to master the 12-hour fast, but Im working on it. Ive read the book twice now and it still travels with me. In fact, I made up several packages of Vanis oatmeal with dates for an upcoming trip. Ive probably recommended the book to more than a dozen people who ask me What are you doing to look like that?Four months after I started this journey Ive lost 42 lbs and am considered by doctors and weight calculators as being at an ideal weight for my height! My husband has never seen me at this weight. I havent been this weight since I was in my early 20s. I want folks to know that I eat too! I eat a lot! My body craves blueberries and asparagus cauliflower lemon risotto, sauted spinach and cabbage, green juice and smoothies, nuts, avocados (I eat one a day!), coconut and organic chicken and fish. Im also asked all the time Dont you reward yourself? I sure do every day! I reward myself with healthy sweets like those pumpkin-spiced nuts or chocolate coconut fat bombs or homemade ice cream. I also reward myself by fitting into size 4 clothes! Clothes are actually fun for me now, not something to hide under.Most importantly Im setting an example for my children of what healthy is and should be. Ive opened up a whole new dialogue with them about what constitutes healthy eating so that were getting the most out of our minds and bodies. I want them to see me as strong, fit and healthy on a daily basis not a picture of what I once was in my early 20s. I believe we lead by example and I need to be an example for them.A few final notes, I kicked butt on my annual fitness test this year. I ran faster than any previous year, did more sit-ups and push-ups than any previous year and had the same waist measurement I did 20 years ago when I was 25. I outran 90 percent of the people I tested with that day  most of them were much younger. In addition, I usually suffer 6-8 weeks with spring pollen allergies (a curse I gained moving to the South)taking a daily pill. This year my allergies have practically disappeared. I only suffered two days! I cant 100% say it is the diet, but I sure think it is. The Food Babe Way changed my lifeand it feels and tastes wonderful!My Top Tips:You must make time for yourself. If you give your time away to everyone else and have nothing left for you at the end of the day then positive life changes, whether losing weight, working out, etc, will be very tough to accomplish.Only you have the power to change your life. Spouse not on-board with the program? Thats ok. You make the decision as to what food goes into your body. If youre not the shopper or the chef, it is harder, but you can purchase for yourself or make requests. You have to want it and not let anyone stop you.Dont be a naysayer. There are so many people Ive encountered that dont believe that organic is better or that pesticides are hurting us. All I know is that I have seen the difference first-hand and I wont let anyone argue with my facts. If you dont believe thats up to you, but dont put it down unless youve tried it.Surround yourself with positive influences! This one is SO IMPORTANT. I could not have done this alone. I had fit, healthy people to encourage me and answer my questions and lift me up. I know my limitations. I know I cannot go to restaurants or drink on a daily or even weekly basis (by the way, I no longer want to), but my positive influencers were all about finding other ways to socialize like PARKfit or making homemade meals. Sure we imbibe from time to timea girls gotta live! But I love them for their company, energy, spirit and supportnot because they come with a cocktail.If you stick with ittruly stick with itthen youll need to go clothes shopping! Dont buy a complete wardrobe the next size down because you may surprise yourself at where your body decides its comfortable. I wanted to wear those size 8 jeans in the worst wayand I did, but only once. Now I need a belt for a few of my size 4s!Good luck with YOUR JOURNEY. I know The Food Babe Way can help you too!

10,The Shocking Email From Monsanto: Why I am submitting a FOIA request,http://foodbabe.com/2015/09/08/proof-monsanto-pays-public-scientists-discredit-movement-submitting-foia-request/,"Ive always said that food andchemical corporationswork with public university scientists behind closed doors to manipulate the publicand now our movement has irrefutable PROOF. But first, let me start at the beginningWhen our movement got big companies to change, Dr. Kevin Folta, from University of Floridaappeared on the scene. Every time we made headway on an important issue, Kevin Folta, who claimed to be an unbiased scientist, was there to refute our claims and throw some ad hominem attacks. Here are a few examples (many more are documented at the end of this post):The fact that she is able to mobilize this army of blind followers who reject science and follow her words, to smear and harm the reputations of companies that are doing nothing wrong. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Kevin M. Folta, the chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, described Ms. Haris lecture at the university last October as a corrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism.  quoted inNew York Times, 3/15/2015Theres something that dies inside when you are a faculty member that works hard to teach about food, farming and science, and your own university brings in acrackpotto unravel all of the information you have brought to students.  Foltas Blog, Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014My intuition and common sense knew that this guy HAD to be connected to these corporations in some way, but he kept denying any connection. And I believed he was causing irreparable harm to our healthy food movement because the media believed that he was an unbiased scientist.Well, NOT ANYMORE.This weekan unprecedented major investigative report was published in the NY Times about how the chemical and food industries work with public university scientists to advance their agendas to the public. Hundreds of emails have now been revealedbetween University of Florida Professor Dr. Kevin Folta, Monsanto, the biotech front groups, and their PR firm Ketchum after a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request was submitted by the nonprofit group U.S. Right To Know.Why would Monsantowork with a public scientist in the first place?Some powerful entities in the chemical and food industries have a financial incentive to try to discredit us in the work we have all done together and now we know how they are using public scientists like Dr. Kevin Folta as sock puppets to advance their message. Weve come a long way in our food movement and things are finally starting to change  people are getting healthier and the food industry is responding to us, but why is someone likeDr. Kevin Folta on a mission to stop our progress?Newly discovered emailsreveal that Folta received a $25,000 unrestricted grant from Monsanto, and even wrote to a Monsanto executive,Im glad to sign on to whatever you like, or write whatever you like,and I promise a solid return on investment.However, Folta previously denied ties to Monsanto, here are 9 different examples:But he denies financial ties.He has no formal connection to Monsanto.David [Oppenheimer] and I have no research or personal funding from Big Ag  only in our dreams.Certainly Monsanto (and others) have funded work at my university. Not my work.I have no financial ties to any of the BigAg companies that make transgenic crops, including Monsanto.I have nothing to do wth MONIm an independent scientist. Not Monsanto.I am one of thousands of independent, public scientists worldwideI have nothing to do with Monsanto. Im not, you know, I dont work for them I am not a shill (laughing) Im a public scientist.Not only was Folta repeatedly dishonest about his ties to Monsanto, but on several occasions according to the NY Times, Folta took word for word answers and commentary from Monsantos PR firm Ketchum to use as his own words. Previously heclaimedhe never used the text written for himby the PR firm Ketchum.Monsanto sells Roundup, the chemical that is sprayed on the majority of GMO seeds. The main ingredient in Roundup was recently classified as a probable carcinogen. They are in panic mode trying to repair their image and will do anything to confuse the public.Folta attempted to derail my speaking event at the University of Florida. He has also beeninterviewed by major media outlets such asThe Atlantic, NPR, and the NY Times acting as an unbiased third party source, telling reporters he has no financial ties to Monsanto or the biotech industry all while acting as the ringleader and chief of my critics.Monsanto thanks Folta for attending my talk at The University of FloridaOne of the emails discovered by USRTK.org showed Lisa Drake, an executiveat Monsanto cheering Dr. Folta on after he attended my talk at his University last fall. Dr. Folta wrote a blog post attempting to discredit my talk including a false accusation that I refused to answer questions from the audience. (FYI Heres the photographic evidence of the long line of teachers and students that I answered questions from.) I still find it bizarre that if he wanted to ask me a question so bad that he didnt stay to meet me face to face. Instead he spread dishonest information about my talk all over social media, in forums and on his blog, acting more like an online troll than a distinguished science professor.Seeing this email sent shivers down my spine and left me with a lot of questions. First and foremost, my talk was not about the dangers of GMO foods, it was about the story of quitting my corporate career to become a food activist sharing examples of major food companies changing their policies. Who wrote thatparagraph summarizing my talk that Lisa Drake referenced? Why was a Monsanto executive sending this messageto Folta? Did they ask him to attend my talk? Are they paying him to attack activists like myself? At the time I had no idea why this professor wasso aggressive towards me but now its starting to make sense. Ive tried to explain to various reporters in the past that many of our critics are part of the larger entrenched food and chemical lobby that doesntagree withhaving more transparency (labeling GMOs) or doesntwant toremove thecontroversial chemical additives from our food. The reporters have always said but what about the public university scientists that have no ties?This investigation finally begins to explain that.Why I am also submitting a FOIA requestIn light of this email and the incredible amount of reputationaldamage Dr. Folta has waged on me personally and our healthy food movement (see a sampling of his public comments below), I am submitting a formal request to the University of Florida to have all documents and correspondence released to the public from Dr. Kevin Folta regarding my name Vani Hari and Food Babe.I believe obtaining these correspondences will serve the public in greater transparency on how the food industry usesindependent third-party scientists and professors to control science and deliver their PR and lobbying messaging.Ive often wondered why companies like Monsanto go through such great lengths to stop transparency about GMOs If their food is safe, why dont they want to label GMOs? Why would they pay public university scientiststo advance their message?Xo,VaniQuotesfrom Kevin Folta:Folta calls me a crackpot, accuses me of food terrorism, blackmail, villifying farmers and compares me to a dog.Vani is very good at marketing herself and telling people what they want to hear.She is very good at playing into the current popularity of vilifying farmers and large-scale agriculture. But really, shes her own company, and shes the spokesperson. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Kevin M. Folta, the chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, described Ms. Haris lecture at the university last October as a corrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism. (Her fee was $6,000.) Dr. Folta added, She found that a popular social media site was more powerful than science itself, more powerful than reason, more powerful than actually knowing what youre talking about..  quoted inNew York Times, 3/15/2015She really conflates the science.If anything, shes created more confusion about food, more confusion about the role of chemicals and additives. NPR, 12/4/2014To have someone like Hari go out and make up nonsense that only digs into public opinion against these technologies is really frustrating for us. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Thats not healthy activism or change based on science. Thats coercion, fear mongering and (yes) terrorism to achieve short-sighted political non-victories in the name of profit and self-promotion, ironically the same thing she accuses the companies of.Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014Luckily, Starbucks didnt foldOtherwise, Hari would have blackmailed them too. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014Vani Hari would be spreading her corrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism here at the University of Florida. Oh joy. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014Responding to the Food Babe is like telling a funny joke to my dog at a party. Everyone there gets it except for the dog. She just tilts her head to one side and looks at me like Im stupid. Response to the Food Babe. This is Boring, 3/19/2015Theres something that dies inside when you are a faculty member that works hard to teach about food, farming and science, and your own university brings in a crackpot to unravel all of the information you have brought to students. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014If this is a charismatic leader of a new food movement it is quite a disaster. Shes uninformed, uneducated, trite and illogical. Shes afraid of science and intellectual engagement. Shes Oz candy at best.-Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014What if Hari were to take a long look in the mirror and decide that while scaring people into boycotts and book buying pays the bills, the legacy associated with it is embarrassing. Time will frown on Hari, and it already is happening. While adored by internet fans, scientists, physicians, the food industry, farmers and science fans see her clearly as the empty information vessel she truly is. The Value of Vani, 12/12/2014Her discussion was a narcissistic, self-appointed attack on food science and human nutrition. There is a vein in my head that pulses when I hear someone deliberately misrepresent science for personal celebrity, and it was pounding.Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014I was really proud to see that the student audience was not buying it. Throughout her presentation that was about Hari in the spotlight and me-me-me, students got up and left. She left gaping pregnant pauses where previous performances got applause only to hear nothing. Not even crickets. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014While microphones stood ready in the audience to answer questions, there was no public Q&A period where a scientist that knows the research could publicly challenge her false assertions.-Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014I guess Im just angry because I didnt get to lock science horns with The Food Babe. I would have liked to have asked a few questions that she could never answer. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014I listened to her talk about herself and provide lots of false information to my students, and waited for the opportunity to ask dismantling questions from one of the two microphones in the room. A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014She did not take questions from the audience. The event ended and the audience left.-A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014She was paid $6000 for over an hours time to promote her brand and spread her filth. Now scientists and educators have to fix it. A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014As we attempt to illuminate products, technology and method to feed a growing population, Haris shameful resistance to reality needs to be met. Weve done that, and Im proud of the push back The Value of Vani, 12/12/2014Recently Ive given a number of talks and interviews where Ive been described as the guy that stood up to the Food Babe. While standing up for science is important, Id rather be described as the guy that changed her mind because I took the time to teach the facts. The Value of Vani, 12/12/2014I cannot think of someone so clueless that thinks shes so clue-full. The bravado to manufacture completely wacky statements is beyond arrogance, and to criticize students who approach her from a scholarly evidence-based point shows shes fully subscribed to her own deception. Vani Haris Kooky Response to CriticalStudents, 1/26/2015Folta discreditsFood Babe campaigns to remove controversial chemicals from the food supply:Bread is a foam. Even culinary experts will tell you.It was a perfectly safe food additive for years, until she came along and decided that Subway bread was essentially a yoga mat. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015The fact that she is able to mobilize this army of blind followers who reject science and follow her words, to smear and harm the reputations of companies that are doing nothing wrong. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Safety always has to be the number one concern. And an understanding of safety is contingent on an understanding of the chemical in question. But she lacks the scientific prowess to be able to tell when something is truly a threat, and when something poses no threat. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Additional Evidence: Folta deniesanyties to Monsanto on his blog:In another thread she encourages those curious to call the university, because a certain professor who promotes Monsanto has spread a lot of nonsense. Again, she speaks from no evidence, leveling false allegations against a public scientist that only wants her to back her claims with science. How do I support Monsanto?-A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014She also took the liberty of making a false association between a public scientist and university professor to a company that does not exist, purely to discredit him.Here are two clear falsehoods that Hari stands by. Why anyone would take any advice from her, ever, is beyond me.-A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014Of course, she ties me in with Monsanto. Blatantly false. But since when does she need evidence before making a claim? Vani Hari (Food Babe) and Silencing Critics, 12/7/2014Foltas personal email to Food Babe (3/19/2015): I work as an independent, public scientist. Companies have no control of my research, my results or my opinions.Youll also see from my publications that almost all of my funding comes from public sources, like USDA, NSF and NIH. Im not a Monsanto scientist as youve suggested. My only industry funding is for strawberries a strawberry industry of family farmers that grow a nutritious fruit. Yes, I answer questions on GMO Answers. I am not paid, Im grateful for the forum, and if you gave me a page on Food Babe.com to answer questions the answers would be exactly the same.26.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

11,I Can’t Believe I Used To Beg My Mom To Put These In My Lunch Box,http://foodbabe.com/2015/05/28/i-cant-believe-i-used-to-beg-my-mom-to-put-these-in-my-lunch-box/,"When I was little, we had a Kmart really close by my house. Every time we would visit, I would beg my mom for Little Debbie Snacks for my lunchbox. Those boxes of deliciousness (and now grossness) lined the end cap of the aisle so nicely by checkout, we just couldnt miss them when we walked by. Little did I know at the time, that I was eating one of the most controversial preservatives ever invented. Youve probably heard all about this ingredient in cosmetics, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes and deodorants, but may not realize that youcould be eating it too.This endocrine-disrupting preservative has been found in the urine of over 90% of Americans, so nearly all of us are being exposedto it from a variety of sources  and theres absolutely no reason we should be eating it!The Culprit: ParabensParabens are added to someprocessed foods as a preservative. Youll find it mostly in cheap baked goods like muffins, cakes and tortillas. But, its also added tosome seemingly healthy products like trail mixes.The problem with parabensThe scientists at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) recently came out with their Dirty Dozen Guide to Food Additives and propyl paraben makes their list as one of the most hazardous ingredients in our food. Their guide lists the 12 worst offenders in the ingredient world that are associated with serious health concerns and which the FDA has failed to take serious action on.Parabens have been researched extensively and found to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are linked to breast cancer (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4), andreproductive problems(sources: 1, 2,3). Parabens act as a weak synthetic estrogen,and endocrine-disruptors like these arebelieved to be a contributing factor in the increasing incidents of early puberty in young girls. According to a report in the New York Times:Of particular concern are endocrine-disruptors, like xeno-estrogens or estrogen mimics. These compounds behave like steroid hormones and can alter puberty timing. For obvious ethical reasons, scientists cannot perform controlled studies proving the direct impact of these chemicals on children, so researchers instead look for so-called natural experiments, one of which occurred in 1973 in Michigan, when cattle were accidentally fed grain contaminated with an estrogen-mimicking chemical, the flame retardant PBB. The daughters born to the pregnant women who ate the PBB-laced meat and drank the PBB-laced milk started menstruating significantly earlier than their peers.Althoughparabens are generally believed to beexcreted fromthe bodywithin hours after exposure, thesehealth effects are being attributed torecurrent exposures that take place over time. As wererepeatedly exposed to parabens in our environment and food, this is a real hazard.Parabens can be in your food even if its not on the label.This is because parabensare sometimes naturally occurring in food (such as blueberries and vanilla) and can also appear in food packaging, contaminating its contents.Researchers recently tested food products froma grocery store in New York and found parabens in 90% of awide variety of foods: drinks,dairy products, oils, fish, grains, meat, fruit, vegetables  so they are everywhere! This means that we cant completely avoid parabens, but we can do our best to minimize our exposure. Eliminating themas a food additive is an easy way to start.What To Look Out For In The Grocery Store:When parabens are added as an additive, theyare fairly easy to spot on an ingredient list, as long as you know what to look for. There are a fewdifferent types approved to be added tofood, and this is how you might see them listed on the ingredient label:Propyl Paraben or PropylparabenMethylparabenSometimes listed as Methyl and Propyl Parabens or Methyl-Propyl ParabenHeptylparaben  This paraben additive is permitted in beer & wine,but unless they agree to list their ingredients well never know if its used.Artificial Flavoror Artificial Flavoring The FDA allows parabens in synthetic food flavorings.Ethylparaben  not commonly used in foodButylparaben  not commonly used in foodBesides checking out the ingredient list,its always a good idea to consider the packaging that is being used in any packaged food, becausethese chemicals may leach into the food. This is yet another goodreason to ditch processed food and head straight to the farmers market!Food Brands Guilty of Using ParabenAdditives:Last month, theEWG launched a campaign, demanding that U.S.companies remove parabens from their food after their Food Scores database found parabens in49 widely-available processed foods. Cheap processed foods are the biggest offenders big surprise! Heres just a few popular brands that have beenknown to use paraben ingredients according to EWGs database:Little DebbieWeight WatchersSara LeeLa Banderita TortillasEmeraldBreakfastPrivate SelectionCafe ValleyArcher FarmsArizona Snack CompanyMrs. Fields(addsparabenstosome frosted cookies)A major place that you mayfind paraben additives is in your local grocery stores private-label bakery section. Ask the bakery department if they will let you read the ingredients in their special-order cakes before you ever order anything. I dont believe in deprivation, and I know there are times in our lives when we just need to eat cake! Instead of picking up a chemical additive laden supermarket cake, try out my fantastic pound cake recipe with homemade chocolate frosting. If you want more help avoiding processed foods with synthetic preservatives, youve got to check out theFood Babe membership program. Youll get exclusive weekly tips, a new monthly meal calendar with recipes, grocery lists and the support of the Food Babe team. Hope youll consider joining us!Dont Be Fooled By The NaysayersSome people who have a vested interest in continuing the use of these synthetic chemicals like to say,Vanilla naturally contains parabens! Your recipes contains parabens!. It is true that parabens occur naturally in foods like blueberriesand carrots, but does that mean we shouldstop eating these healthy foods? Absolutely not!As over 90% of us have been shown to have parabens in our urine, we are being over-exposed to parabens, and its not because we are eating too many vegetables. Theres no reason for food manufacturers to continue the use of synthetic paraben additives as preservatives in food. As stated in the postabove parabens are everywhere  so we should do our best to limit our exposure by choosing foods (and beauty products) without these additives. Propylparaben is on EWGslist of food additivesto avoidfor a reason. The use of synthetic parabens as an additiveis irresponsible and should be stopped.Please spread the wordDo you know someone who isnt reading ingredient lists or is still buying brands like Little Debbie Snacks? If so, please share this post with them!The real food movement is spreading like wildfire because of your sharing, so thank you!Xo,Vani31.7K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

12,Shocking: Why Are Doctors Recommending This Toxic Drink?,http://foodbabe.com/2014/05/13/shocking-why-are-doctors-recommending-this-toxic-drink/,"I have been receiving emails from the #FoodBabeArmy about an alarming practice that happens at doctors offices around the country that needs to stop today.First, however, I was thrilled by the news last week that Coke and Pepsi both announced that theyre (finally) removing Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) from their products  which includes Mountain Dew and Powerade. Of course these products are still no good for your body, as they are loaded with sugar or artificial sweeteners, preservatives, phosphates, and artificial colors.Once consumers find out about these questionable ingredients, food companies have nowhere left to hide, but some remain in denial, Ill get to that in a minute.This is a great win for my friendSarah Kavanagh, an amazing teen food activist(seen below)who started the initial Change.org petition, and also for the #FoodBabeArmy because BVO is one of the most harmful ingredients that is still being used in the U.S., even though its banned in Europe and Japan. Its patented for use as aflame retardant!Its banned for good reason.According to food chemist, Walter Vetter, PhD, BVO can build up in the body and cause toxic effects. Most shockingly, there is a published report of a man who had to undergo dialysis after regularly consuming large amounts of Ruby Red Squirt containing BVO. There is another report here indicating that soda with BVO caused the same condition, deteriorating a man to the point that he couldnt even walk. Of course, these people were drinking an insane amount of soda (up to 8 liters a day), and the cumulative effects on your body when you consume fewer BVO-containing drinks is largely unknown because the research is scarce. Charles Vorhees, a toxicologist at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center agrees by saying, Compounds like these that are in widespread use probably should be reexamined periodically with newer technologies to ensure that there arent effects that would have been missed by prior methodsI think BVO is the kind of compound that probably warrants some reexamination.Out of the research that has been done, it has been shown that BVO accumulates in your body and is linked to heart lesions. As reported in Scientific American, After a few extreme soda bingesnot too far from what many gamers regularly consumea few patients have needed medical attention for skin lesions, memory loss and nerve disorders, all symptoms of overexposure to bromine. Given this evidence pointing to the dangers of BVO consumption, can you believe that it has taken SO LONG for Coke and Pepsi to finally remove it from their products? There really is no excuse. Way back in the 1970s, the FDA began to question the safety of BVO and put the ingredient on interim status, which meant that food companies could use it in products until toxicology research was done. Well  guess what? Those studies have not been done in the last 40 years, so it has remained in our food  and the FDA has done nothing about it. With the FDA asleep at the wheel, you will still find BVO legally in these drinks by the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group:SquirtDiet SquirtRuby Red SquirtDiet Ruby Red SquirtSunkist Fruit Punch SodaSunkist Peach SodaCrush Orange SodaCrush Peach SodaCrush Pineapple SodaPeafiel Grapefruit SodaPeafiel Mandarin SodaSun Drop Citrus SodaDiet Sun Drop Citrus SodaSun Drop Cherry Lemon SodaStewarts Orange n Cream SodaDiet Stewarts Orange n Cream SodaStewarts Key Lime SodaI found it incredibly disturbing that some of these sodas comply with school beverage guidelines and are being served nationwide in our schools. A member of my team contacted Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and was told they have no plans to remove BVO from any of these drinks because its FDA approved and has been diligently researched. At least we know the truth and will avoid these drinks at all costs.Also, many store brand citrus sodas still contain brominated oil, so watch out for those too.And we arent done yet.There is one place where BVO is lurking that is reprehensible  and I knew that I needed to bring light to it. A drink containing BVO is being prescribed by doctors to pregnant women everywhere when they get tested for gestational diabetes  a routine test given to nearly all pregnant women in the U.S. Check out the ingredients for the Oral Glucose Tolerance Beverage by AeroMed:These drinks (also known as Glucola) are essentially sugar water with hazardous artificial colors and preservatives with a VERY LONG shelf life. They are no better than most sodas on the market  and truly not something youd want to consume while pregnant. Yet, doctors routinely prescribe this non-carbonated soda to their pregnant patients, without taking into consideration the dangerous ingredients they contain. While its certainly important to monitor your blood glucose during pregnancy, there are alternatives to drinking this toxic sugar water.Realize you have a choice  Simply ask your doctor what other options you have and if they dont know, educate them!The purpose of the drink is to ingest 50 to 100 grams of glucose, after which your doctor can test how your body handles influx of sugar.This woman was given the alternative of eating real food, such as bananas.This study showed that eating 28 jelly beans had the same effect on blood sugar in a 50 gram glucose test. Of course, youd want to choose a non-gmo variety, free of artificial colors and other nasties! An even better option that you can discuss with your doctor would be to avoid the test altogether and monitor your blood sugar with a glucometer throughout your pregnancy, as recommended here, here and here. This is the best alternative because you wont create an extreme blood sugar spike, and can stick to your regular healthy diet. You will also avoid feeling like you are going to vomit and the dreaded crash and burn that women report after drinking glucola  including several Food Babe readers who have reached out to me personally.As you can see, there is absolutely no reason that you need to consume these toxic glucola drinks. Now that you are informed, you can make a better choice for yourself and your baby.Remember, I am not a doctor (take my advice at your own risk), however, in my opinion there is no way in hell any doctor could convince me to drink something with flame retardant, artificial dyes made from petroleum, controversial preservatives and GMOs, pregnant or not!If you know someone who is pregnant or is still drinking BVO, please share this critical information with them and let them know they have a choice!Wishing you the greatest health imaginable.Xo,Vani372K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Wed have sandwiches, soup, salad, those little free mini corn and gingerbread muffins and free ice cream at the end of every visit. The prices were economical which suited my Dads frugality and the location was super convenient. But as soon as I started figuring out what was in restaurant food, my trips to Jasons Deli stopped. I didnt really have a specific reason other than the fact that home prepared meals tasted better and made me feel great  much better than the days I would go out to eat.Jasons Deli is a very popular choice for a lot of people out there, not just my family, so I thought it would be crucial to investigate their food. Besides, many of you have asked for this specific investigation on facebook for quite some time now so with no further delay, heres what I found out.  On paper Jasons Deli appears to have your health in their best interest. Jasons Deli was the first major restaurant chain to eliminate transfat and high fructose corn syrup. They recently claimed to have eliminated MSG too (we will address that later) and1/5 of Jasons Deli menu is organic  an absolutely staggering statistic considering the size of the menu. They also do not use any artificial colors  another amazing feat considering all the restaurants that still do.So this begs the question  What other ingredients should you watch out for at Jasons Deli? What should you still be concerned about? And whats REAL FOOD and whats not?Trying not to be overly exhaustive, I requested the ingredients of a sampling of some of the most popular items on Jasons Delis menu. Requesting the ingredients was easy compared to some of the investigations I have done in the past. There are a couple of ways you can get your hands on the ingredients. You can call the headquarters and request them, email them or ask in the store. If you ask for the ingredients in the store, it is a quite laborsome for the employees as they have to dig for the packages to show you the ingredients on actual boxes. Unfortunately, they do not have a list in a neatly organized binder. During the several requests I made using all of these methods, Jasons Deli employees (in the stores and at the headquarters) were amazingly cooperative and made sure I got all the answers I was looking for  a huge win in my book. However, posting their ingredients online for everyone to see would be an even bigger win in transparency, especially considering their tag line We are all about healthy food. Until then, Ive posted the ingredients that I inquired about below, so this can serve as your online guide until they do. (please note: the ingredients highlighted in red are either potential genetically engineered or GMO ingredients, harmful additives or preservatives  in other words, things no one should willingly want to eat.)***Update: After releasing this investigation,Jasons Deli posted all ingredients onlinewith an Interactive Nutrition Menu a huge win in transparency!***Jasons Deli Ingredients(Sampling of Menu Items)Artesian 9-grain Bread The first ingredient is refined white flour  (you can tell when you see that vitamins and minerals are added back into the flour and the word whole is missing from the front of the word wheat). Refined white flour is basically empty calories with zero nutrition, but thankfully they add in a bunch of other whole grains to round out the bread.Whole Grain Bread  Has several questionable ingredients added to it  GMOs in the form of soybean oil, soy lecithin, dextrose etc., caramel powder (which is just a powdered form of caramel color that is considered a carcinogen), and preservatives, along with questionable natural flavorsthat trick your brain into enjoying a processed product like this more than you should.Croissant This bread definitely doesnt come from France considering all the preservatives and dough conditioners it contains, especially the ingredient azodicarbonamide which is banned in Europe and if you get caught using it in Singapore you are fined $450,000 dollars  the substance is linked to asthma and allergies.Organic Wheat Wrap  Definitely the best choice on the bread menu.Wild Sockeye Salmon  Any restaurant serving wild salmon over farmed salmon deserves praise, but the additives used here are dreadful. Several ingredients are genetically engineered and spice extractives can be a hidden form of MSG.Ham  Carrageenan is the most concerning ingredient here, first of all whats a seaweed by-product even doing in ham? I found out it is used as a gelling agent that mimics fat that you would normally find in meat. For low fat meat products, manufacturers add it to improve texture. Carrageenanwhen ingested can start to degrade in the gastrointestinal tract and in the liver and turn into a carcinogen, resulting in a serious inflammatory agent that also can cause intestinal abnormalities.All Natural Chicken Breast  One thing I would like to mention here is that just because a meat is labeled natural doesnt mean its free from GMOs. By the looks of the ingredients here, this would be the best meat option to get, however you have to realize the chickens were likely fed GMO corn and soy  not the healthiest diet. Personally I would avoid meat all together and go vegetarian for this reason.Roast Beef, Chicken Salad I would avoid both of these choices  there are GMOs, hidden MSG (hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed corn gluten, and/or autolyzed yeast extract) and caramel color. Whats so bad about caramel color, you ask? Its not thetype of caramel you make at home by cooking sugar. This caramel color is manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure, which creates carcinogenic compoundsproven to causeliver tumors, lung tumors, and thyroid tumorsin rats and mice.Chili, Southwest Chicken Chili, Organic Vegetable SoupThis is where Jasons Deli really messes up. And it wouldnt be a stretch to say their No MSG message in their marketing is a total lie if you read between the lines. As you have noticed above, there is hidden MSG in several different meat products, as well as all of their soups  including the organic vegetable soup in the form of autolyzed yeast paste. The amount of MSG that restaurants can put in your food isnot regulatedand having a No MSG label is extremely misleading if they replace MSG with other forms that cause the same health issues.MSG is an excitotoxin that if given in large enough doses canexcite brain cells to death.MSGcan cause adverse reactions in some people including skin rashes, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, asthma, heart irregularities, depression and even seizures. Additionally,MSG is an ingredient added to different recipes so your brain remembers a taste combined with the smell of a food. Food scientists use it to create addiction. Bottom line, it doesnt belong in food considering the obesity crisis in this country.Homemade Ranch  Looking at the ingredients above, you can see that calling this dressing homemade is a complete joke. I dont have maltodextrin or carrageenan sitting around in my pantry, do you?Organic Balsamic  The best option for dressingOrganic French Dressing Another good option, but not a fan of natural flavoring as mentioned above.Mac & Cheese Light years ahead of Kraft Mac & Cheese, but still concerning since the cheese used is not guaranteed to be hormone and antibiotic free.Guacamole  Clean of additives. I would use this as a salad dressing.Organic Corn Chips  I found out they use Garden of Eatin brand chips, which are GMO free. The only issue I have with these is that they use canola oil, which is not a healthy oil.Over-consumption of oils like canola are causing an abundance of Omega 6 fatty acids in our diets. The imbalance of Omega 6 fatty acids increases the risk of inflammation, heart disease, obesity, andprostate and bone cancer.Pickle  This was a huge bummer. I was excited there were no artificial colors but bummed that the pickles contain sodium benzoate, one of the absolute worst preservatives out there.The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservativeincreases hyperactivityin children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can formbenzene, acarcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Chocolate Chip Cookie & Fudge Brownie (see picture below)  Both of these baked sweets have propylene glycol, the same ingredient that you winterize cars with  antifreeze, and the same ingredient that lubricates condoms. This is definitely not an ingredient I want to end my meal with!Ice Cream  Besides the carrageenan already discussed above, artificial vanilla flavor is manufactured in a factory without using any real vanilla beans, instead it is a by-product of the wood pulp industry. Polysorbate 80, which is in both flavors, is linkedtoinfertility in mice, an increased riskof blood clots, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and tumor growth or recurrence in patients with certain types of cancer. Anarticlepublished about polysorbate 80 found that the agent could cause pregnant woman to go into anaphylactic shock and isharmful to patients with Crohns disease.Lastly, the milk products used are not hormone or antibiotic free, this should be enough reason to leave Jasons Deli without eating the free ice cream.Given all this information, the obvious question now isWHAT WOULD I GET AT JASONS DELI?Straight off the menu, I would feel pretty good about ordering the Nutty Mixed Up Salad (likely without the chicken)and Spinach Veggie Wrap. Also I would excitingly order all the organic vegetables currently available (which are: spinach, mixed greens, apples, carrots and peas) at the salad bar and top it off with a huge side of guacamole and hummus. Id also get the steamed veggies if I were feeling like I wanted something warm to eat. (Note the zucchini that is offered in the steamed veggies may be GMO since it is not organic.)For the kids in your life (if ordering off the kids menu), Id go with the Organic Peanut Butter & Jelly or the Organic Grilled Cheese but with organic whole wheat wrap or 9 grain artisanal wheat bread vs. the whole wheat bread that has additives (as discussed above). Organic carrots and organic apples on the side are a wonderful accompaniment too!I know I stopped going to Jasons Deli a while back but given the opportunity to dine there again, I wouldnt think twice. Its a no brainer  Jasons Deli blows away the competition when it comes to quick, easy and organic meals without having to visit a grocery store.If you think this post can help someone make the right decision the next time they visit Jasons Deli  please share it with them. I want this information to be out there helping as many people as possible who would not otherwise know or understand the ingredients they are eating.Thank you in advance for spreading the word.XOXO,Food Babe5/1 Update: Just received the ingredients in the famous free mini muffins at the salad barI would stay far, far away!86.3K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

14,Is Your Protein Shake Safe?,http://foodbabe.com/2012/12/13/is-your-protein-shake-safe/,"Protein shakes, powders, and supplements are incredibly popular with the health conscious crowd. Considering what typical protein shakes promise  sleek muscles, weight loss and a quick, easy healthy meal replacement  its logical to see why, but is your protein shake safe? Unfortunately, the food industry is making an absolute killing (maybe literally) selling ones that are filled with highly processed denatured proteins, chemicals, preservatives and other additives. Theres one thing in common for all of them  they are all processed and deciding on whether or not they are actually real food comes into question. Now not all processed things we put in our body are technically bad for us  but understanding what exactly is in your protein shake is critical to deciding whether to consume it, select an alternative, or discontinue use all together.GET INFORMEDWeve discussed GMOs here, Artificial Colors here, Natural Flavors here, Carrageenan here, Antibiotics here, and Hormones here before so I wont go into them again in detail specifically. Regardless, you should know consuming a protein drink with any of those ingredients is a risk to your health.NOT CERTIFIED ORGANICMost protein powders on the market are not certified organic, nor are they Non-GMO Project Verified. That means all of them might contain GMOs and most definitely contain pesticides that are considered harmful and potentially toxic with long-term exposure. This increased exposure is linked to birth defects, nerve damage, and even cancer. The Presidents Cancer Panel has urged us not to consume food sprayed with pesticides and doesnt believe any amount is safe. Because of this reason, I cant imagine willingly wanting to spend a serious chunk of change (protein shakes are expensive!) to buy any of these listed products as a way to help build muscle, lose weight or replace a meal.IS YOUR PROTEIN DRINK SAFE? Hmmm NOT WITH THESE INGREDIENTS:Heavy Metals Consumer Reports conducted an eye-opening investigation that revealed several protein powders contain heavy metals  specifically arsenic, cadmium, and lead. EAS Myoplex tested for two heavy metals in higher amounts than the USP limit of exposure per day. Muscle Milk had the highest of all levels of all brands tested.Heres an excerpt taken from the Consumer Reports investigation on Protein Powders:Cadmium raises special concern because it accumulates in and can damage the kidneys, the same organs that can be damaged by excessive protein consumption. And it can take 20 years for the body to eliminate even half the cadmium absorbed today. This is a highly toxic metal, and while there are some cases where decisions have to be weighed against relative risks, accepting that you have to be exposed to any cadmium at all in your protein drink after your workout is definitely not one of them, says Michael Harbut, M.D., director of the Environmental Cancer Initiative at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Royal Oak, Mich. When these toxic heavy metals are combined in a product that is marketed for daily use, that raises serious public health concerns, especially for pregnant women, children, and young adults, says Burns, who has been a toxicology consultant to state and federal government agencies.Soy ProteinMany protein drinks use soy protein concentrate or soy protein isolate in conjunction with other proteins. Over 90% of the soy produced in this country is GMO and contaminated with Roundup herbicide, but thats not the only reason to avoid soy protein. When soy is looked at from a macronutrient perspective, it can give the illusion of a very healthy food  full of plant based protein, essential amino acids and fiber. However, the soy that is grown and produced today is largely hybridized, making the amino acids largely indigestible leading to digestive issues that have caused many people to be allergic to soy. Whats worse is when soy is isolated to just its protein state, it becomes severely denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions because of the excessive amount of estrogen contained in it. Soy also has an abundance of phytic acid that leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body.Maltodextrin & FibersolCalling out an ingredient filler like maltodextrin may make you think Im being nitpicky  but is this carb substitute that is likely derived from genetically modified corn really necessary in protein powders? Maltodextrin can be used to make the substance fibersol. This is made by heating maltodextrin at very high temperatures and treating it with enzymes and acids to make a fiber your body simply cant digest and makes you feel artificially full. If you are eating enough plant-based foods, there is no reason to supplement with this type of chemically derived fiber. Fibersol is just another additive that does absolutely nothing for your long term health. Why not add a real food like spinach or a banana to your smoothie instead?Acesulfame Potassium or Acesulfame KThis is the most common form of artificial sweetener available in protein drinks (and tons of other processed foods) today and according the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) it is anything but safe. CSPI reported thesafety tests of acesulfame-K that were conducted in the 1970s were inadequate. Specifically, two rat studies suggest that the additivemight cause cancer, but these studies were never addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance to also be used unregulated in soft drinks. In addition it is mentioned that large doses of acetoacetamide (a breakdown product of this sugar) have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs.Whey Protein IsolateWhey protein isolate is highly processed, unlike whole protein food concentrate.Most whey protein isolates start from ultra-pasteurized conventional milk that has antibiotics and growth hormones and are then exposed to acid processing, stripping alkalinizing minerals, naturally occurring vitamins and lipids. This processing makes whey protein isolate over acidifying in the body. Chronically consuming whey protein isolate without appropriate balance of alkalizing foods, can acidify your body and over time increase your vulnerability to degenerative disease. This overly processed form of whey can be found in a lot of popular protein drinks.Luckily, you dont have to rely on protein drinks because simply eating a variety of real food alone gives you plenty of protein.But, if you are still concerned about protein you could make a protein-filled real food smoothie like this or choose from any of these real food sources of protein below:Meat sources of protein  beef, pork, poultry, eggs, yogurt, cheese, fish (very important to choose organic if you go this route) Vegetarian sources of protein  legumes (dry beans, lentils, and peas), nuts and seeds (almond butter, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds), whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice, pasta),dark leafy vegetables, and some fruits like avocadoSO ARE THERE ANY HEALTHY PROTEIN POWDERS?Fortunately, there are a few Food Babe approved protein powders, including Organic Plant Protein Superfood 30 ShakeTeras Organic Whey, Nutivas Hemp Protein that do not contain any of the ingredients mentioned here, and would fall under the definition of real food in my book. If you decide to supplement your protein, it is very important to double and triple check the ingredient list and check with the manufacturer to see how they process their protein.If you know someone using a questionable protein powder, please share this post with them  I know they will be grateful to know the truth, considering how much some of these types of supplements cost!Xo,VaniUpdated 8/2016: Additional research on protein powders added andremoved outdated information.759K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

15,Another Fabulous Vegan Potluck…,http://foodbabe.com/2012/01/18/another-fabulous-vegan-potluck/,"Good Evening!I broke Habit #3 last night  but for good reason.I started the day with Habit #1 and Habit #4 (do you know these habits by heart yet?) I also had some protein powder mixed with chia seeds after a quick 3 mile run.I practiced another Habit #4 with a Hari Shake before lunch.I followed the shake about an hour later with a salad at my desk. I dont really like eating at my desk, but you gotta do what you gotta do especially when there are back to back meetings you have no control over.I have complete and utter control over what I put in my mouth, though. I stuffed it full ofquinoa, arugula, tahini, red peppers, carrots, red onion and raisins, a few buckwheat crackers with almond butter too. Oh and I had a few Marys Gone Sticks & Twigs  Have you tried them yet?  they are so great when you are feeling all snacky snacky and want something crunchy crunchy!After work I did a quick 45 mins of yoga at home  I needed to decompress from sitting all day long. I did a few hand stands during my sequence Ive been feeling rather dizzy at random times during the day since I started practicing them hopefully this will subside with time. Any yogis out there experience this?Last night, I spoke at Three Weeks to Wellness and was invited to another amazing vegan potluck before my talk I made lots of Forever Cookies with cherries to share with all the cleansers just like last time.I was kinda mad at myself  because I didnt write down directions to the new gathering spot and I was late. I missed all the yummy food explanations (my favorite part), so I honestly dont really know what I ate for dinner. My plate looked like this and everything tasted fantastic.At the cleanse, I got to catch up with Scott Harris, the owner of Viva Raw. He was doing the cleanse and brought fresh juice for everyone to try. Viva Raw uses local and organic produce to make their juices and will deliver them to your door if you live in Charlotte. Ive tasted Viva Raw juices and their protein blend a couple of times now and definitely recommend them, especially if you want to do a juice cleanse!We had the vegan potluck at Plan Breathe  I havent done a breath works class there yet  but I heard its like tripping on oxygen. Sounds fun!My talk was about dairy. My favorite moment was hearing the room get silent when I talked about how the female cow is the #1 over worked animal in the world. Typically kept pregnant by artificial insemination for 7 months out of every year  which equates in human terms to us running about 8 hours every single day for 7 months. Can you imagine the toxic stress hormone we would produce in our bodies if we did that? Well its the same for the cow  and you are consuming those toxins if you consume dairy products.(Maybe I should video tape the next talk I am giving in Feb  so I can play it for all of you? What do you think?)At the end of the night  Elle presented me with the most beautifully gorgeous wrapped gift in a vintage apron. A special something from her fashion inspired business  Urban Gypsy.Even though I ate a full plate of foodI came home at 10pm absolutely starving! I went straight into the pantry and made a big bowl of candy! Breaking Habit #3 was worth it, dont you think?In honor of the cows  Im going to sign off with a big loud.Moooooo!Food Babe32@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

16,Should I get the Flu Shot?,http://foodbabe.com/2011/10/04/should-i-get-the-flu-shot/,"***Disclaimer  This post is strictly based upon my opinion and consultation of my own health provider, I recommend you make the best choice for you and your family based upon your own due diligence and research on this topic. *** One of the goals I made in starting this blog back in April, was to uncover and unveil information that isnt readily available for public consumption on true health, nutrition and wellbeing. I want this blog to help you break free from the conventional wisdom that the food industry, government agencies, pharmaceutical and medical community try to push because of greed or corruption that is ultimately harmful to you and your family. I want you to walk away questioning what you put in your body  food or medicine. I want you to learn from my mistakes and adopt the positive discoveries Ive made. I want you to feel as good as I do. But most importantly I want to give you the information you need to make real informed decisions about your health.This is why it is extremely important to understand the Flu Shot  I want you to think about what you are directly injecting into your bloodstream. Before you consider jumping off the ledge with other lemmings and taking this years Flu Shot  Here are the questions I think you should ask yourselfWhats exactly in the Flu Shot? To sum it up  A bunch of toxic chemicals and additives that lead to several types of Cancers and Alzheimer disease over time.Heres a list of what could be lurking in that vial of vaccine:Egg Products (including avian contaminant viruses)AluminumThimersol (Mercury)Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)Chick Embryo CellsLatexFormaldehydeGelatinPolysorbate 80Triton X100 (strong detergent)Sucrose (table sugar)ResinGentamycinI wont eat any of these ingredients or even put them on my body  however, the mainstream medical community, government agencies and pharmaceutical companies suggest that I directly inject these ingredients into my bloodstream? And I need do it every year until I die? Are you freaking kidding me? Long term effects of the combination of these toxic additivesare very alarming  a very famous immunologist & geneticist has completed studies and research that shows in that every five flu shots a person receives over a ten year period they increase their risk of Alzheimer Disease by ten times! This is because of the ingredients above  Aluminum and Mercury  they slowly destroy your brain cells one by one.Does the Flu Shot really protect me against the Flu? No, the CDC even admits it doesnt protect you because the virus mutates every year and they cant predict which strains will hit. Even when they do get the strain right, they cant prove it actually works. Just do a google search for the effectiveness of the flu shot and just see how many studies prove it is ultimately unreliable and ineffective. In a couple of studies I read, The flu shot was compared to a placebo  The same number of people caught the flu regardless if they took the shot or not!Why do I have to get a Flu Shot every year? Arent vaccines suppose to immunize you for life? They have to continuously give you a flu shot, because it is not a real vaccine. Lets say for instance, you get a vaccine for another virus like Hepatitis A or B  you are immunized for life. Why isnt this the case with the flu vaccine? Because the scientists have not developed a real vaccine for the flu and are continuously guessing on how to come up with a new chemical formula that could be effective.Research has shown that it takes close to a full year to develop an effective vaccine against a virus  however, in developing the flu shot  scientists spend less than 4 months producing it so they can get it out for production before flu season starts. They dont have time to thoroughly test it or judge its reactions in the human body. They take a chance on the symptoms it causes and that it might work  are you willing to take this chance too?What kind of strain are they going to use this year for the Flu Shot? Its the same one as last year. Really? But then why do I need to get another shot if I got one last year? This is the way the pharmaceutical companies continue to make money off of you  The CDC says it wears off. And this brings me back to my previous point  if the flu vaccine were truly a vaccine  it wouldnt wear off. Think about it  Once you get chicken pox as a child, your body develops antibodies to strengthen your immune system from ever getting chicken pox again. This is how vaccines are suppose to work. But the flu shot doesnt work this wayThere is something wrong with this pictureWhy is there so much pressure to get the Flu Shot year after year? Why does every drug store have a sign up promoting the shot? Why are shots available at work? And at school? Why is their so much propaganda each year around this time? There is only one answer  Money. The making, distributing, and administering of the flu shot is a 7 Billion Dollar Industry. Each year the pharmaceutical industry eyes glow with $ signs when its time to make more as the American public become the guinea pigs again to try it out.Why are Flu Shots recommended for children, women who are pregnant and the elderly? Because that group of individuals typically have weaker immune systems and if they catch the flu and dont treat it in time it can lead to other complications like pneumonia. However,why would you give a group with already weakened immune systems something that weakens their immune systemsystemically further?The flu shot causes all sorts of side effects and symptoms likeMuscle pain, respiratory tract infections, eye problems, abnormal blood pressure, asthma, hives, and gastrointestinal problems that could also lead to other complications. This is why the vaccine isnt effective in the first place, because administering a drug that weakens the immune systems makes people even more susceptible to the flu! This is another reason I believe why some studies I read proved that the flu shot was not effective in treating the elderly.Why have some countries banned the Flu Shots in the past? Because it caused all sorts of terrible and sometimes deadly reactions in their children and other citizens. Australia banned the flu shot for all children under 5 last year when 250 children were hospitalized and one died after receiving the vaccine. Finland and Sweden also banned the shots and opened up an investigation last year. Dont you wonder why this didnt make major news here in the United States?Can I immunize myself naturally from the Flu? Yes! You can build lifetime antibodies against the infection. Just Skip the vaccine, boost your vitamin D intake, and encounter the flu naturally. If you encounter the flu  rest, take care of yourself, understand that your body needs a break and focus on getting better  This type of immunizing yourself works amazingly better than relying on an artificial injection that has been proven ineffective. Youll have these new antibodies for life that will ultimately protect you from similar strains of the virus better than any yearly shot could ever provide.What ongoing things should I be doing and getting from my diet to keep my Immune System healthy and to prevent getting the Flu?Exercise daily, Take Probiotics, Get Vitamin A from beta carotene, Vitamin C, B6, B12, Garlic, Zinc and plenty of Vitamin D. Building up your immune system can help your body fight off the flu virus before you experience symptoms and lessen the time you take to recover from the flu.Is Food Babe planning to take the Flu Shot?Given all the answers I have learned above  No, Im not taking the Flu Shot. Ever.Wishing you the best health life can offer and all the sunshine in my heart.Love,Food BabeP.S. If you know someone who would like to hear about this perspective, please share this post with them.P.S.S.I am notanti-vaccination, I choose not to take the flu shot for the ingredients they contain as stated above.129K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

17,Goodie Goodie Gumbo,http://foodbabe.com/2011/05/30/goodie-goodie-gumbo/,"Happy Memorial Day! Partying Hard with Family!Happy Memorial Day Weekend! Weve been spending this weekend with my cousin Raja and his wife Tina visiting from Dallas. In the middle of the night last night Raja declared we must make Gumbo for Sunday Funday! We had all been drinking and celebrating a huge family event. We were all a little delirious and tired from all the festivities.Raja & Tina  Dodging the speed street crowd on the way to celebrate my cousin Reevas graduationRaja, I could tell, was very enthusiastic about showing Food Babe his cooking skills. Ever sense Rajas arrival on Friday, hes been in my kitchen playing with my Shun knives and contemplating what he could chop next. He diced left over lemon rind from a garnish earlier in the day. You can tell Raja loves the kitchen as much as Food Babe. Maybe this is because our mothers, who were both pregnant with us, took us on our first trip together to India before we were even born. We are only a few weeks apart in age, both born Aries, a raging fire sign and have more in common than we both like to admit.A little excited first thing in the morning, prepping veggies before our trip to Earth FareRaja is from Louisiana and well, not the healthiest state in America and wanted to make traditional gumbo. We began to discuss whats exactly is in gumbo.. he declared all sorts of Food Babe unfriendly ingredients like bleached white flour, inorganic oils, and pre-cooked conventional & nitrate filled sausage and was very hesitant, in fact, adamantly against changing the original recipe. I pleaded with him back and forth and finally he was convinced we could make this organic.So here it is  Organic GOODIE GOODIE Gumbo!Going to Earth Fare for all the organic goodsTina in charge of the cartLooking for the best bell peppers in the houseEarth Fare hand made fresh Andouille Sausage  doesnt get fresher than thisChecking out  This was the least Ive spent at Earth Fare ever.

18,Are Baby Carrots Soaked in Chlorine?,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/03/are-baby-carrots-soaked-in-chlorine/,"If youve been following along onFacebook, you know that I was in NYC earlier this week to film an investigative report well, now it is out!Inside Editioninterviewed me as a food expert,regarding thebaby carrot controversysweeping the web.Watch the full story here:For the record: I love carrots, I eat them or juice them almost everyday, but personally I do not buy baby carrots, because I prefer the taste of larger, non-ready to eat carrots better.Also, if you know me, you know this  I want the least amount of environmental chemicals to enter my body. I filter my water at home (to remove chlorine and other chemicals) and wash my vegetables with filtered water before consuming them.The most important decision you can make at the grocery store regarding carrots is not whether they come in a bag or not but rather if they are organic or conventional. According to the USDA Pesticide Data Program,conventional carrots can have up to 26 different pesticideson them (16 of them are hormone disruptors, 8 are carcinogens, 7 are reproductive toxins, and 3 are neurotoxins).My recommendation for everyone is to choose organic carrots for this reason.Here are some behind the scenes photos from the shoot. I had an absolute blast chatting with Paul Boyd from Inside Edition  hes quite the comic! We even taste tested the carrots. Baby carrots are grown from a sweeter variety and you can definitely tell the difference in taste!Hope you enjoyed the clip!Food BabeP.S.

20,Monsanto Is Scrambling To Bury This Breaking Story – Don’t Let This Go Unshared!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/11/15/monsanto/,"I am frankly shocked this information is not making front page newsright now.Monsanto will do anything to bury this story and as of right now, its working. Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food.This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world.The health of millions of people is on the lineand this newsmust go mainstream! Thats whyIm calling on every single one of you who reads this post toshare this breaking story now.The only way this injustice will be corrected is if enough of us stand up and demand that something be done to stop the poisoning of our food supply.Share this shocking new report with everyone you know.A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsantos Roundup) and foundALARMING amounts.Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins atreally low levels of exposure  at only0.1 ppbof glyphosate. Manyfoods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulatorsthroughout the world consider safe.{See thetest results and full report by Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project}.Here is why we all should be concerned about eating glyphosate:Independent research links glyphosate to cancer (sources:1,2,3,4,5) and it has been deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organizations team of international cancer experts. Thechildhood cancer rate is steadily risingand experts say that they dont know why. Why are they not taking a closer look at these facts?Research also indicates that glyphosate is anendocrine disruptor, which disrupts hormones and leads to reproductive problems, early onset puberty, obesity, diabetes, and some cancers. When it comes to endocrine disruptors,very small exposuresare the most damaging, sothe dose makes the poison mantradoes not apply!Glyphosate isa broad-spectrum antibiotickilling the good bacteria in your gut.Poor gut healthis linked to inflammation and a whole host of diseases. As GMOs laced with glyphosate are commonly fed to farm animals, this could very well becontributing to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.It binds with vital nutrients in the soil (like iron, calcium, manganese, zinc) andprevents plants for taking them up. Glyphosateis thereby making food less nutritious!Why is this weed killerin these foods? Even non-GMO and organic food!This chemical has gone so mainstream that glyphosate has infiltrated every facet of our environment  our water, air, soil.ManyGMOs were invented to be resistant to glyphosate  and since GMOs have been introduced the use of glyphosate has gone through the roof! It is now the worlds most widely used herbicide.Glyphosateis not just used on GMOs. Conventional (non-organic farmers) use Roundup as a drying agent on crops, such as oats and wheat. It cantbe simply washed off, as it is taken up into the plant itself.As the active ingredient in popular Roundup herbicide, millions of people are using this stuff around their homes, and its widely used at parks and other public spaces.So, that is why its not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate. Its contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and its even in our honey! The FDA quietly found it in almost every singlesample of honey that they tested (from mass produced to organic mountain honey). The media has been essentiallysilent and barely anyone heard this news!Even if you dont personally eat thespecific brands that were tested (I dont), how many peopleare eating Cheerios and Ritz Crackersevery day? A lot! How many of your friends and family have their cabinets filled with these foods?These people need to know this information.There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we cant be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe. Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical. Yes, I said poison.Monsanto doesnt want the public to know these findings for obvious reasons. They have our regulatory agencies in their back pocket to make sure they can continue to make a hefty profit while poisoning the masses.While there are now several manufacturers of glyphosate herbicides, Monsanto completely dominates the market and this is a best seller. They are raking in BILLIONS every year and certainly dont want that to stop. They are clearly, without a doubt, using their prosperity to influence our government regulators. Why else wouldthose entrusted to protect the public from harmful chemicals turn a blind eye to this? Our public agencies are allowingcorporations to poison Americans for profit.In 2013, the EPA massively increasedthe industry standard of what is considered a safe level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK. Instead of properly regulating, they effectively raised the safe level so that no one can blame the industry for poisoning us with unlawfulamounts of chemicals.This is corruption at its finest.The EPAhas a long and sordid history of doing whatever Monsanto wants and you have to ask yourself why this continues to happen and how we can make it stop.The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosates link to cancer in humans. The industry is fightingtooth and nail to make sure that the EPAevaluation will be in their favor and is trying to control who will be on the panel. Why wont the EPA do their job to make sure that the worlds most widely used herbicide isnt causing us all to get cancer? Dont you think this should be a top priority? Its time for the EPA to put the public health above the corrupt desires of corporations. When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided tosuspend their testingthis week. Could it be that Monsanto didnt like the results they started getting  especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.Doesnt the public deserve to know this information? It should be shouted from the rooftops!It is shameful that the American media has thus far failed to cover this breaking news, but WE HAVE THE POWER to make this information go viral. If you really want to stop the corruption perpetuated by Monsanto and the large chemical companies  this is how we shut them down! CALL TO ACTION: Share this post with everyone you know. Tweet, share, and email this information to major media outletsand ask them to cover this story.Remember the best way to avoid glyphosate is bychoosing certified organic foods because it is prohibited on organic crops. Although contamination is a real threat, the levels on organic foods are minimal compared to whats been found on conventional foods. Its been shown that people who eat organic foods haveless glyphosateandother synthetic pesticides in their system.The people of this countrymustbeinformed and this should be our top priority.

23,The Exciting Changes The Food Industry Made in 2015 Because Of Us!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/01/01/the-exciting-changes-the-food-industry-made-in-2015-because-of-us/,"Happy New Year! Welcome to 2016!Reading all the news about food this past yearhas been a bit surreal for me. It seems like there was a new announcement every week that eliminated another chunk of our food supply that was once tainted with chemical additives, GMOs or antibiotics.Our world istransforming and its absolutely beautiful to be part of with all of you.Theres a landslide of artificial additives falling out of our food. You (the Food Babe Army), along with hundreds of food activists and consumer interest groups, have truly been at the helmof manyof these changes.Youve beenleading the way by sharing investigations, signing petitions, and simply asking for healthier food without fake chemical additives, flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs.While we all know these changes are just a startand weve got a long way to go I thought it would be a good idea to sit back and take a look at all thats happened in just the last 12months. Seeing this picture of my topnine most liked Instagram posts in 2015  sums it up pretty good, but there is so much more that happened. When you see the long list below, you might do a double take, but thats what we did in just one year! We made history together and its AMAZING.JANUARY 2015Heineken Newcastle Brown Ale (January 26, 2015) Removedcaramel coloring (level IV) to their Newcastle Brown Ale, and will go back to coloring it the natural way with roasted malt. In 2013, following extensive work done by CSPIwho sued the government to require ingredient labels on alcohol30 years ago, I publishedthe long list of hidden ingredients that are permitted to be used in beerswithout labeling. At that time, Ireached out to Heineken as the maker of my husbands favorite beer  Newcastle  and disclosedon my blog that they color it artificially with caramel color andthis post went absolutely viralwith millions of page views. I also wrote a chapter about all the additives in alcohol in my NYT Best Selling bookThe Food Babe Way, which I released early in December before the book came out. I continued tocorrespondwithHeinekenperiodically until they emailed me this January, as your husbands former favorite beer. I wanted to make sure you knew that we have removed caramel coloring from Newcastle completely.FEBRUARY 2015General Mills  (February 6, 2015) In response to our petition asking them to dump the BHT just as they do overseas, General Mills said that they will be removing this controversial preservative from their cereals. They have yet to provide a timeline for its removalbut theyhave made progress and havesince removed BHT from some varieties of their cereal  Golden Grahams, Cocoa Puffs, Banana Nut Cheerios, and Corn Chex no longer contain BHT. Kelloggs also committed to look into removing this verycontroversial additive, but has not provided a timeline either.Nestle Chocolate  (February 17, 2015) Announced that they will get rid of artificial colors and artificial flavors from their chocolate candies, including Butterfinger and Crunch bars, by the end of this year. In 2012, weexposed the artificial additives in candy bars, a post you shared thousands of times. Now at least two of these additives (artificial colors and artificial flavors) will be gone from Nestle chocolate for good!Hersheys Chocolate  (February 24, 2015) On the heels of Nestles big announcement, Hersheys said they are cleaning up their famous Milk Chocolate Bars and Hersheys Kisses, by removing GMO sugar and GMO soy lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), vanillin and artificial flavors, and will use milk from cows not treated with the growth hormone rBST. In 2012, I wrote about the GMOs in most popular chocolates and asked for a boycott of these brands (including Hersheys) until they got rid of the GMOs and last December GMO Inside started a campaign to get GMO sugar out of Hersheys Chocolate.MARCH 2015McDonalds  (March 4, 2015) Announced that over the next 2 years they will stop using chickens that were treated with antibiotics commonly used for humans after behind the scenes pressure from us and several consumer interest and activist groups:NRDC, Friends of The Earth,Pew Charitable Trusts, Consumers Union, Center for Food Safety,FACT, Keep Antibiotics Working, Consumers International, U.S. PIRG and others. You shared so many posts from here on FoodBabe.com about the dangers of feeding growth-promoting antibiotics to animals, notably here,here, here, and on CNN here. This is huge news, as McDonalds is one of the biggest industry leaders.Costco  (March 5, 2015) Just one day following McDonalds, Costco reports to the media that they are in the process of eliminating chicken and meat that was raised on human-use antibiotics from their stores.Dunkin Donuts  (March 10, 2015) Removed the whitening agent titanium dioxide from their powdered sugar, following a campaign by the non-profit group As You Sow. Theydecided to remove it after As You Sow reportedly foundtitanium dioxide nanoparticles in their powdered donuts. This is important because nanoparticles (super tiny particles) arent necessarily safe and can be more dangerousthan larger versions of the same substances.APRIL 2015McDonalds  (April 2, 2015) Starting to clean up their grilled chicken, and wontcook it in the liquid margarine that theyve used for years in many of their menu items. They are removing sodium phosphates and maltodextrin from their grilled artisan chicken breasts. In March, we put a spotlight on theinsane amount of additives found in McDonalds food, even their healthier items like their Premium Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad, full of soybean oil, hidden MSG, and high fructose corn syrup (and thats without the dressing).Kraft  (April 20, 2015) Kraft finally announced plans to drop the artificial colors (yellow #5 and yellow #6) from all of their Mac & Cheese products. This came after we launched a petition in 2013 asking them to remove these fake dyes made from petroleum, and to use the same safer natural food colorings that they use in other countries. Ourpetition ultimately garnered over 365,000 signatures and received widespread media attention. When I visited their headquarters to deliver signed petitions two years ago, they told me that we would have to agree to disagree  and revealed no plans to remove these dyes. Well, we did it! The fake dyes in Kraft Mac & Cheese will be ancient history by January 2016.Pilgrim Pride  (April 20, 2015) Told reporters that they are working to stop the use of human-use antibiotics in their chickens within 18 months, and has further plans to eliminate all antibiotics from  of their chickens by 2019. Pilgrim is one of the major suppliers of chicken to Chick-Fil-A, and as the 2nd largest poultry processor in the U.S. this news should rock the industry. My #1 request when I met with Chick-Fil-A in 2012 was for them to go antibiotic-free and when they finally committed to this requestin 2014 itbegan to make shock waves!Chipotle  (April 28, 2015) Officially dumped all genetically modified (GMO) ingredients from their food (excluding animal products and drinks). This means that they are no longer using tortillas with GMO ingredients and wont be cooking their beans in GMO soybean oil any longer. In 2013 we finally convinced Chipotle to list their ingredients online publicly, after weexposed the GMOs in most of their menu items. Not only did you share this post a lot, but some citizen activists even started a petition based on my investigation. The pressure worked!Tyson  (April 28, 2015) As the largest U.S. poultry producer, Tyson announced huge plans to stop using human-use antibiotics in their chickens by September 2017, and is working on this for other meat as well. Tyson is also a major chicken supplier for McDonalds, so this move was likely influenced by them.Wendys  (April 29, 2015) Starts offering their first organic item: tea.MAY 2015Panera Bread  (May 4, 2015) Announced they are removing 150 artificial additives, including artificial colors, BHT, nitrates, high fructose corn syrup, hidden MSG, and partially hydrogenated oils. Wecalled out Panera back in 2012for using nitrates and hidden MSG ingredients like hydrolyzed corn and soy protein, autolyzed yeast extract and yeast extract. Now those ingredients will be history! They are all slated to be removed by the end of 2016. This commitment also extends into their soft drinks, as the New York Times reported that Panera is going to either sell Pepsi products without high fructose corn syrup, or kick them to the curb!Target  (May 19, 2015) Reportedly told big name brands like Kraft, General Mills, Campbells, and Kelloggs that they were going to stop heavily promoting their products in their stores. Instead, Target will stock their shelves with more food from healthier organic brands.Walmart  (May 22, 2015) Askedtheir suppliers to stop the use of growth-promoting antibiotics. Theyre also asking them to follow five principles of animal welfare, ensuring the animals are not starved, have sufficient space to move, and do not suffer mental distress.Abbott Laboratories  (May 25, 2015) The maker of Similac Advance baby formula cameout with a non-GMO version thatissold in Target stores. They will also be launching a non-GMO Similac Sensitive formula, and if sales are strong they will offer more non-GMO varieties. In 2014, we reported the results of testing done by Consumer Reports that found GMOs in many popular infant formulas, including two Similac formulas. Several activist groups (Green America, GMO Inside, As You Sow) have been working extensively to rid GMOs from infant formulas.Unilever  (May 26, 2015) Announced they are coming out with a new non-GMO Hellmanns Mayonnaise made with olive oil. Since most mayonnaise dressings are made with GMO soybean oil, and Hellmans is an industry leader, GMO Inside started a campaign last year to get the GMOs out of Hellmans real mayo. (This non-GMO mayonnaise is already in some stores, but beware that the eggs used were raised on GMO feed and non-GMO soybean oil is an ingredient).JUNE2015Subway  (June 4, 2015) Plans to remove all artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in the U.S. and Canadaby 2017. This is clearly just a start, but I was thrilled that they have been working onremoving caramel coloring from their cold cuts!But, they made no mention of the breads that still contain it. Subway has so far been tight lipped about which specific ingredients and preservatives they are nixing.I first broke down the ingredients in a Subway sandwich 2012, and showed that every Eat Fresh sandwich contained preservatives, andthey stilluse a lot of them! Artificial yellow dye shouldbe coming out of their fat-free Italian dressing, banana peppers, andpickles.Subwaycurrently uses artificial flavors in a number of items (like a few of their breads and cookies), but if all theyre going to do is replace those with natural flavors that isnt an improvement.General Mills Cereal  (June 22, 2015) Removing artificial colors and artificial flavors from all of their cereals, including Lucky Charms, Trix, and Reeses Puffs. For instance, instead of using Red #40, Yellow #6 in Trix, theyre going to start coloring it naturally with turmeric and berry juices  which is huge news for parents that report that their children are sensitive to these artificial food dyes. The majority of their cereals dont contain artificial colors already, but 40% dountil these changes finish rolling out in waves by the end of 2017.Papa Johns Pizza  (June 23, 2015) Announced theyre removing 14 ingredientsby the end of 2016, including artificial colors, caramel color, the preservative sodium benzoate, and hidden MSG ingredients like autolyzed yeast extract and hydrolyzed proteins. We wrote all about these hidden MSG ingredients used in Papa Johns pizza in our pizza investigation in 2014, and reported their lack of transparency in refusing to disclose ingredient lists. Since ourinvestigation, they listedingredients on their website (however thislist is NOT complete).If youheard the news that Pizza Hut & Taco Bell are removing artificial ingredients hereswhat I think about that in this video!July 2015Campbells  (July 23, 2015) Theyregetting rid of artificial flavors and artificial colors by2018 in all of their brands  Campbells Soup, Pepperidge Farm, Swanson. Theywill also remove high fructose corn syrup from some products and offer more organic products.In 2013, I wrote about how Pepperidge Farm duped my familyinto buying their products full of artificial additives  this post was viewed by millions of people because you shared it. Once you learn this information, you cant unlearn it and thats why these companies have had to change for the better! Wendys  (July 27, 2015) Starts offering chicken raised without antibiotics in four test markets.August 2015Kelloggs  (August 5, 2015) Following General Mills lead, they will start removingartificial colors and flavors in their cereals, snack bars and Eggo products to be completedby end of 2018.Starbucks  (August 17, 2015) Starbucks published the new ingredients in their reformulated Pumpkin Spice Latte, which now includes real pumpkin and no caramel coloring, on their blog. This camefollowingmy initial investigation into their ingredients in 2012 and after millions of you readmy post aboutStarbucks PSLin 2014,which exposed their lack of transparency about ingredients and that the PSLcontained class IV caramel coloring thats linked to cancer.In March, Ireceived an email fromStarbucks corporate offices confirming they removed caramel color from their vanilla syrup and willfrom their other beverages.General Mills Fruit Snacks  (August 25, 2015) Fruit Rollups, Fruit By The Foot, and Fruit Gushers will be free of artificial colors and flavors by the end of 2017. In 2014 I called out the unhealthy Generally Toxic ingredientsand thousands of you shared this post.McDonalds  (August 31, 2015) Starts using real butter and ditches the trans-fat containing buttery spread that they previously used.September 2015McCormick  (September 8, 2015)Introduced non-GMO vanilla extract (many brands contain GMO corn syrup) and said80% of their gourmet herbs & spices will be organic and 70% of all of their herbs, spices, and extracts will be non-GMO by 2016. This is big news because although the spices themselves are not GMO, they can be mixed with derivatives of GMO corn or soy, and many spices are heavily sprayed with synthetic pesticides and irradiated (not allowed on organics). You shared this post about all additives that could be lurking in your spice cabinetthousands of times!October 2015Mondelez (October 1, 2015) Removing artificial colors and flavors many products such astheirOreo cookies and Ritz crackers but they gave themselves until 2020 to do it.Aldi Grocery Stores  (October 1, 2015)Removed artificialcolors, partially hydrogenated oils (trans fat) and MSG from their store-brand products.Subway  (October 20, 2015)Committed to eliminating the use of antibiotics in all of their meat in the U.S.  and they also provided a timeline. This announcement came followingour major petition in conjunction with other petitions launchedbyotherconsumer advocacy groups (U.S. PIRG,NRDC,Center for Food Safety,Friends of the Earthand others) thatIve been working closely with for the last year. All of these petitions received a total of over 250,000 signatures! I was literally about to board a plane to deliver petitions to their headquarters when this announcement was made!Schwans  (October 21, 2015) Working to removepartially hydrogenated oils, high-fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors and artificial colors by 2017 from their many brands such asRed Baron, Tonys, Freschetta pizza, and Mrs. Smiths.November 2015Guinness Beer  (November 2, 2015)Willeliminate the use of isinglass (fish bladders) in their refining process, making their beers vegan-friendly. Many people were unaware of this practicewhich I exposed in my 2013 beer investigationand my book, and although it may not be harmful, its use is not labeled anda big concern for vegans who would never guess that animal parts are used to produce some beers.December 2015Papa Johns  (December 18, 2015) Joins the growing list of restaurantsthat will no longer servechickenraised on antibiotics. By next summer, their grilled chicken pizza topping and chicken poppers will be antibiotic-free.As You Can See. We accomplished a lot this year! Everything that is happening in this giant GOOD FOOD MOVEMENT is mind blowing to me.Please note, this list only captures just some of the changes we directly impacted or were involved with, but so much more is happening behind closed doors. Food companies everywhere are making tweaks without alerting the media and public, so make sure to pay attention to those ingredient lists and keep asking questions!Ittruly has taken hundreds of food activists and consumer interest groups, along with all of us working together, sharing investigations and petitionswith ourfriends and families, to spreadthis movementlike wildfire. These companies know that we wont back down, and that we are looking to them to keep improving their products.It certainly seems thatsome additives that have been mainstays in processed food for decades (like artificial colors) will soon be out of our food for good. This is a really exciting time! I love this quote from Richard McCarthy of Slow Food USA on this current food movement:What was once considered unrealistic is now pragmatic and good businessWhile the fine print may not speak to dramatic shiftsthe bounds of thinkable thoughts are moving towards our belief that food should be good, clean and fair.I thank you and all the food activists that work along side us for your incredible work.

26,3 Things Doctors Say You Should Do… But Shouldn’t!,http://foodbabe.com/2015/06/02/3-things-doctors-say-you-should-do-but-shouldnt/,"This post is written by Dr. Joel Kahn, otherwise known as Americas Holistic Heart Doc. Dr.Kahn is a practicing interpreventional cardiologistwho also writes for Readers Digest. He has taught dozens of residents and cardiologists, andgraciously accepted to be a speaker at the launch party for The Food Babe Way in New York City back in February. I am thrilled to have him as a contributor here!I am hardly a doctor basher. Last I checked, I was a cardiologist actively involved in seeing hundreds of patients a month. In the next few months I am lecturing at several medical meetings sponsored by University faculty and hold the position of professor at 3 universities myself. But it is no exaggeration to say that in general conventional medicine is slow to adapt new ideas and platforms. While I could pick many aspects of practice that are due for an overhaul, I want to focus on 3 that come to mind that need to be flushed from medical jargon.1.Moderation in everything is the keyThis is simply wrong. My advice for patients is extreme in diet, moderate in fitness, abundant in love. Why do I say that? Although I wont go into detail about fitness, there is abundant research in the last few years that extreme exercise, like repeated marathons or triathalons, may acutally increase the risk of heart diseases. The current mantra is exercise is like a medication and the dose matters. More central is the issue of nutrition. Simply put, medical societies have failed to address the critical connection between diet and the origin and reversal of chronic diseases. For example, years ago Dr. Dean Ornish compared the impact of the diet and lifestyle on blocked heart arteries. The control group was told to follow their doctors dietary recommendations and the experimental group was told to follow an extremediet constituting mainly plants. At the end of 5 years, heart artery blockages became more severe in the conventional group but showed reversal in the extreme diet! Other examples of extreme diets stressing quality of foods, plant-centeric approaches, and organic produce have shown reduction in cancer growth, reversal of aging, and reduced excretion of pesticides in children and adults. I advise you to be vigilant in what goes into your awesome body to maximize your health and vitality.2.Vitamins just make expensive urineOh how doctors love to bash vitamins, or nutraceuticals if you want to impress friends. When I am at a party with doctors and it is a bit dull I just say in a loud voice, excuse me, I have to go take my last few dozen vitamins! Sure, there are legitimate areas of confusion but are all vitamins just window dressing to make someone rich? Hardly based on the science. For example, take Coenzyme Q10, an antioxidant and substrate to make energy in every cell in the body . Can you find CoQ10 in a hospital? Can patients or their families freely bring a bottle into the hospital to use for health? The vitamins will likely be confiscated like crack. How strange when studies show improved outcome including death when CoQ10 was studied in rigorous trials. My favorite 4 vitamins, or my Core 4, for all to consider is a probiotic to improve their gut health or microbiome, chelated magnesium to assist in over 300 enzymatic reactions, Vitamin D3, and CoQ10. Shh, I take about 20 more to assist optimal cellular health on a daily basis.3.A sleeping pill wont hurt youAt that same time that medical science has shown the importance of 7 good hours of sleep to restore our metabolism to normal overnight after a stressful day, fewer and fewer people are achieving those good 7 hours. Whether it is EMF and wifi, bright lights rich in 480 nm blue waves from our PCs, pads and phones, or jobs that hyper-connect us 24/7, nearly a majority of respondents to surveys indicate that they sleep poorly. So what is the harm in your doctor giving you a prescription for a sleeping pill (hypnotic) or stress pill (anxiolytic) to help you sleep for the rest of your life? In fact, that recommendation from your doctor may risk your very life. In a recent matched-cohort study from American clinics, a prescription for even <18 sleeping pills a year was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of death and higher doses increased the risk of dying by 5-fold. Of course, it may be that people getting those prescriptions had other reasons for poor sleep that were associated with death but we must consider the possibility of a direct relationship. In another even more recent analysis involving 100,000 subjects, a prescription for hypnotics or anxiolytics was associated with a risk of dying that was over 300% higher than those without a similar prescription.What should you do if you are sleeping poorly? I suggest you say No Thank You to your doctors prescription. Make your bedroom cold and dark. Turn off your wifi and cellphone if you can. Take an Epsom salt bath and meditate for 10-20 minutes before bed. Consider adding a nighttime cocktail of chamomile tea, magnesium lotions or powders, or herbs like valerian before bed. I sleep on sheets that ground me to the earth and recommend that approach to you too.Life has changed dramatically since Marcus Welby MD and Dr. Spock advised us on how to maintain our health. Even Dr. Spock reevaluated his advice to so many mothers late in his life and advised extreme care in dietary choices for optimal health. We live in an age where it is acceptable to question medical authority, particularly on issues about nutrition, and it is advisable to link over to www.pubmed.com and search the National Library of Medicine to seek your own information. When I went to medical school at the University of Michigan my favorite professor told me that 50% of what he was going to teach us was wrong, but he did not know which 50% it was.While you dont throw out the baby, or your health care provider, with the bathwater, it is permissible to question medical advice with the simple question: Why?More about Dr. Joel Kahn:Dr. Kahn is a practicing interpreventional cardiologist, known as Americas Holistic Heart Doc, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1983. Dr. Kahn has been practicing invasive, interventional and preventive cardiology in suburban Detroit since 1990, and was advanced to full Clinical Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine and Associate Professor of Medicine at Oakland University Beaumont School of Medicine. Readers Digest magazine selected Dr. Kahn for their Holistic Heart Doc column and their publishing arm published his book, The Whole Heart Solution, in 2014. He appears regularly on Fox TV 2 in Detroit as a health commentator. He has been nominated as a Top Doc in cardiology for most of the past years. In 2011, he received a certification from the University of South Florida in Metabolic Cardiology, and became the first physician to complete the program in the world. He is now a visiting lecturer for that university and has traveled the country speaking. To learn more, visit drjoelkahn.com.Note from Vani: What do you think about Dr.Kahns post?

31,10 Grocery Store Items You Should Never Buy Again (Plus the good alternative swaps!),http://foodbabe.com/2014/10/21/10-grocery-store-items-you-should-never-buy-again/,"Earlier this monthon my Facebook page, I asked you to share yourbiggest ah-ha moment whenyou started to read ingredient lists. I asked this question because Im curious about what opened your eyes to the processed chemicals the food industry is dumping in our food.There were over 1,500 responses on Facebook to my question, and I tried to read every single one of them. I found your comments insightful, really encouraging, and some were really funny! Im glad to see that so many of you are changing your eating habits and reading ingredient lists!Isaw severalrecurring ah-ha moments (the same ones I had when I started my journey), so I am summarizing the top 10 most popular ones here for you to share with your friends and family, just in case they havent had these ah-ha moments yet. You might even see your own ah-ha moment quoted below! If you didnt already know about any of these major offenses at the grocery store, this will also give you tips for what to lookout for next time youre shopping.10 Grocery Store Items You Should Never Buy Again:1. Pickles & Relish That Contain Artificial Food DyeWHY do they need to add artificial chemical coloring? Same with everything that adds chemical for coloring. Its just WRONG ~ SaraPickles started a food change in my house when I realized my children couldnt even eat a pickle without eating yellow #4 & #5. Totally changed how we eat! ~ TracyYellow #5 in my Pickleshuh?? Why on Gods green earth is that in there?!! ~ CarrinTheres Yellow-5 in Mt Olive dill pickles!! ~ Josh and ErikaFood dyes. Its even in pickles! Really?!?! Couldnt understand that one. Grandmas pickles were always green and she never used yellow #6 ~ BeckyThis week it was Vlasic dill pickles, which we usually keep a giant jar of. Why do pickles need food coloring? ~ JulieDyes. Especially items like food coloring in pickles. Um, WHY? ~ HeatherPickles have yellow #6! WTH?? Why?? ~ AmberWhy do we insist on putting artificial colors in everything?!! Pickles arent supposed to be fluorescent!!! Nature colors things beautifully on its own! ~ ChelsLynFood dye in pickles..idk why but it pissed me off ~ TinaRelishwould never have thought there would be food coloring in relish. Blech!!! ~ KimOmg pickles? ~ VanessaRecently I looked at every single jar of pickles in a conventional grocery store, and only found one brand that didnt contain artificial yellow food dye. Of course, there is no real reason to add dye to pickles, as its just used to make them look prettier and gives us no other benefits. Artificial colors are linked to health issues and have been banned or require a warning labels in several other countries  so food manufacturers often take them out of their products in other countries. Most pickles contain Yellow #5 or #6, which havebeen shown to contribute to childhood behavioral problems. Better Store-Bought Alternative:Real Pickles (brand) organic pickles, Woodstock organic pickles.2. Canned Soups WithMSG!That all my favorite soups have MSGs in them. ~ TeresaWhen I compared a cream of chicken soup label to a recipe & realized how basic & easy it is to home-make with only 4 ingredients!I literally got angry!! ~ BrandiI ate my usual Dr MacDougalls lentil soup today and then noticed it had yeast extract in it. Seriously??? Hidden MSG in healthy soup?? Ugh!!! ~ AndreaHigh fructose corn syrup in canned and boxed tomato soup. I couldnt find any available product without sugar, so I had to make my own! ~ SaraWhen I realized that the chicken bullion I put in my soup was basically a block of msg. ~ KellyJust how awful most canned and boxed foods are. And how extensive the naughty list is. I used to keep cream of soups in the pantry and use them in my casseroles. I just cant bring myself to do that anymore. ~ ChristineCampbells chicken and stars soup  shocked it has High fructose corn syrup and MSG! Never giving this to my kids again! ~ CandiceSoy in 90% of soups in grocery stores ~ MelanieMSG (akaMonosodium Glutamate) is areally common ingredient in packaged soup, along withhidden MSG ingredients like hydrolyzed protein and autolyzed yeast extract. These flavor enhancers trickyour braininto eating more than you should and have been linked to headaches, obesity, depression, and mental disorders. Better Store-Bought Alternative: Amys Organic Lentil Soup or make your own like I do. Heres a recipe for one of my favorites  carrot ginger soup.3. Salad Dressings That Are Full Of GMO Oils!Salad dressings!! They all have soybean oil!!! And basically how EVERYTHING has soy in it ~ SierraGluten in salad dressings ~ DaviYellow food dye in Italian salad dressing. Why?!?! ~ NeekaCant eat salad dressings because of soy/canola oils. I now must get over it and make my own. ~ NormaMSG is in a lot of foods even salad dressings no wonder I was getting migraines! Im highly sensitive to it ~ CarolineThat nearly every salad dressing has Xanthan gum or guar gum in it. ~ SusanSOYBEAN OIL and/ or canola in every single salad dressing or mayonnaise!! We just make our own now. ~ MelissaThis is why I make my own salad dressing. Its super easy to whip up a vinaigrette at home to avoid dumping GMO soybean oils all over your healthy salad. You might be surprised to know that even salad dressings that say they are made with olive oil (likeWishbone Olive Oil Vinaigrette) typically contain soybean oil asamain ingredient. Almost all store-bought salad dressings also contain emulsifier ingredients to help them stay blended on the shelf, but dont do anything good for your health.Better Store-Bought Alternatives: Raw Foodz Salad Dressing (not available everywhere),Hilarys Eat Well Salad Dressing &Wilderness Family Naturals Salad Dressing. If you are a Food Babe Eating Guide subscriber, youll get a new (and easy) salad dressing recipe every month as part of the plan. Check it outhere.4. Bread That Has Way Too Many Nasty Ingredients!Many packaged breads and baked goods contain L-cysteinea non-essential amino acid made from dissolved human hair (often from China) or duck feathers (mmmm). Food manufacturers use the ingredient as a commercial dough conditioner, meant to change the texture of breads and baked goods. ~ ArthurHigh fructose corn syrup in bread. ~ SeanColor and corn fructose in my 100% whole wheat bread. Argh ~ VanessaGMO corn syrup in bread. ~ KrystlHigh fructose corn syrup in light wheat bread. ~ KatieBread! Such a simple food is now a health hazard if purchased in most grocery stores. ~ Farmhouse Blues InteriorsHigh fructose corn syrup and the long list of ingredients that go into bread. ~ ArushiOnce I started noticing all the products (Baked items/Breads) that have Azodicarbonamide in them. Since quitting eating foods with that my respiratory issues have gone away. SO glad I found out about that horrible, unnecessary ingredient being put in food. ~ TraeBreadsomething you think is a simple staple ~ LaurieOne thing that drives me nuts it bread with 30 ingredients! Wth! It should have maybe 5! Egh! ~ JacquelineHow about store bought bread?! Can you believe all of the stuff that is in it?! Homemade is sooooo much better for you. Time consuming, yes, but way better for you! ~ DarcyIts nearly impossible to find bread at the store without dough conditioners(like the yoga mat chemicalazodicarbonamide), added sugars, artificial colorsand GMOs  which is ridiculous because it really only takes 4 ingredients to make bread. Although I dont eat a lot of bread, when I do I dont want to be subjected to unnecessary and harmful ingredients. So, I generally stick to sprouted grain breads or gluten-free varieties that are made up of primarily seeds and healthy grainslikemilletandquinoa. Better Store-Bought Alternatives:Food For LifeEzekiel 4:9 Sprouted Grain Bread,Manna Gluten Free Ancient Grains Bread. Heres a list of more clean ingredient breads.5. Coffee Creamer That Is Full Of Trans Fat!Coffeemate coffee creamer. Omg???!!!!!!! Switched to organic half and half this week. ~ HomairaCoffee creamer..silicon dioxide anyone????? ~ MiriamCoffee creamer. So gross to even think about how much of that Ive consumed! ~ JulieCoffee creamer. I now make my own with all organic ingredients and couldnt be happier! ~ CaraCoffee creamerstill breaks my heart! ~ CristaYouve opened my eyes with carrageenan..I had no idea! I was drinking it every morning in my organic coffee creamer! ~ KateCreamers with carrageenan!! ~ BrandiWhen I found out that Coffee-Mate Non-DairyCreamers primary ingredient waspartially hydrogenated oil I was disgusted. Millions of people are dumping deadly trans fatinto their coffee every morning. Sure, theyonly use a bit in their coffee, but would anyonepour themselvesa full glass of it? Of course not. Yet, theyll eventually consume the entire container. This is theperfect example of why I think the motto Everything in Moderation is bogus. AFDA loophole allows Coffee-Mate toclaim that it has no trans fat because it contains less than 0.5 g. per serving,although their serving size is only 1 tablespoon. According to the CDC, trans fats are linked to 7,000 deaths and over 20,000 heart attacks!Better Store-Bought Alternatives: Coconut milk  its thick and creamy and most only contain 1 or 2 ingredients if you stick to the culinary version like Natural Value and Native Forest. You can also make your own coconut milk by combining 1/4 cup coconut manna and 4 cups water into a blender. Blend on high for 1-2 mins and keep milk in an air tight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.6. Baby Formula That ContainsCorn Syrup!Baby formula. I was so upset I gave my kids this after I read whats in it. ~ JenniferBaby formula. For some the first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. Ugh ! ~ MaryBaby formula really made me angry when it had to become my daughters main source of food!! ~ KristaCorn Syrup in organic baby formula ~ CarolinaBaby formula! Poor little ones! The victims of industry. ~ AlleDomestic baby formula. After I stopped breastfeeding at six months I wanted to find an organic formula that was free from ingredients that I discovered infants should not ingest. I was disgusted by what was included in the ingredients  even organic formula. I now purchase a formula from the U.K. as they dont allow those same crap ingredients in baby formula. ~BeckyIts outrageous that mostconventional baby formulas in the store contain GMOs and milk from cows treated with antibiotics or artificial growth hormones. Even organic formulas arent perfect, and can containcarrageenan, synthetic preservatives, refined sugars with detectible levels of arsenic, and DHA extracted with hexane. As put in this guest post by Nutrition expert, Charlotte Vallaeys other options include donor milk and this recipe from the Weston A. Price Foundation.Better Store-Bought Alternative: Babys Only Organic Formula and HiPP Organic Formula.7. Canned Tuna That Has Hidden Soy (GMOs)!Canned tuna in water may contain soy. ~ JeanneSoy in cans of solid white albacore tuna. Wtf. ~ HillaryI cant believe gmo corn and soy is in everything!!! Please look at tuna. Why does it need soy? ~ ChristieTuna packed in waterwhich is actually broth, which contains soy! ~ DianeSoy in everything!! Even my tuna! WTH??? ~ LinzTuna is not a main staple in my diet because the practices largely used in the industry arent sustainable and are endangering marine species. Couple that with the fact thatmainstream tuna brands typically packtheir tunain a soy-based vegetable broth, and not actually in water like it says on the front of the can. If you like to occasionally eat tuna, seek out a brand from a sustainable fishery that uses pole & line (and troll-caught) fishing methods, preferably from North Americanwaters and packed without additives in BPA-free cans. When tuna are pole & line caughtthey are younger and much smaller, so they do not have the high mercury content that is found in most regular tuna.Better Store-Bought Alternative: American Tuna (brand)MSC Certified Sustainably Caught Albacore Tunaand Seafare Wild-Caught Tuna.8. Soda That Is Full Of Artificial Ingredients!Diet coke (and other diet sodas) being chemical nastiness in a can! Went cold turkey 4 years ago and havent been tempted once since that daywhen you know better, you do better ~ AndiGinger ale isnt really healthy..all pop (soft drinks) are just chemicals! ~ ElizabethAspartame will cause seizures in those prone to them. For me: No diet coke=no seizures. ~ AllisaI will also never regret the day I gave up diet coke!! ~ KatieI had a lightbulb moment about the huge bottles of diet coke Id drink daily. I had no idea that they were robbing me of my bone density. I quit that day and had another bone density test a few months later and it was amazingly wonderful. I never looked back.~ ChrisMine was when I saw the womens heart association label on Diet Coke cans several years ago. Made me think thats like cigarette companies putting lung association labels on the package. Food/ drinks that come with warnings of what it contains.like gum, diet pop .fair warning..its toxic. ~ BethAspartame. I use to be obsessed with diet coke and thought I was making a better choice cuz it was diet ~ DeneanHansens natural sodas containing artificial sweeteners in the diet varieties. ~ AmberIt wasnt what I read on a label, but giving up sodas has been an eye opening experience. I get full faster and I have no sugar cravings any more. Although I was drinking diet sodas I am amazed at how that crap was influencing my diet. ~ LaurieBoiling soda just once. Never drink another one. ~ ThomasYears ago when I worked in a marine store and sold Fozz, which is used to remove rust from metal. Then reading the ingredients in Coca Cola, which has the same ingredient: phosphoric acid! I stopped drinking soda from then. ~ MaggieA common ingredient in regularsodais high fructose corn syrup, which has been shown to be processed by your body differently than regular cane sugar. According to a 2007 study, high fructose corn syrup containsastonishingly high levels of reactive carbonyls, which are not present in table sugar, and these carbonyls are believed to cause tissue damage, and may contribute to the development of diabetes.Even more disgusting is the use of chemical artificial sweeteners (like aspartame and sucralose) in diet drinks, as these have been shownto stimulate your appetite, increase carbohydrate cravings, and promote weight gain.Better Alternatives:Homemade REAL Ginger-Ale,homemade iced tea or Kombucha.9. Very Controversial Ingredients That Are In Cereal!Aspartame in Fiber One cereal ~ EricaBHT in so many cereals ~ JennyI started noticing BHA & BHT in the kids cereal and various other foods and looked it up. I found out they are carcinogens and banned in just about every country but ours. ~ MichelleBreakfast cereals.BHT, sugar, preservativesand many more. GROSS ~ RachelKashi cereal. Wondered what was on it to keep you full. First ingredient is soy. Now what to do with boxes i have.  throw away or donate and let this poison feed someone else? I think i just answered my own question ~ RochelleThe amount of sugar in cereals I thought were healthy, & serving to my kids! ~ TraciPaint thinner in childrens cereal ~ KimTSP in cereal! ~ MichelleLife cereal has RED FOOD DYE? ~ HeatherSeeing BHT in almost all cereals. What? WHY? ~ Don and JenSix different names for sugar (sucrose) in the ingredients list for a cereal, to hide the fact the main ingredient is SUGAR. ~ EmiliaFiber One original cereal. I just couldnt believe I ate that junk for so many years almost daily with skim cow milk. Now I read the ingredients in all their new products and just hope nobody buys them. ~ JeezusTo think that this childhood morning staple is loaded with artificial colors, GMOs, preservatives, refined grains and sugar, makes me sick. One of the worst ingredients in many cereals is the preservativeBHT (butylated hydroxytoluene). Its a knownhuman allergen that has also caused tumor growth in animal studies. Due to serious health concerns,its been banned or restricted in several countries, yet itswidely used incereals here in the U.S.Better Alternatives: Oatmeal, Parfait Porridge,Two Moms In The RawPlain Grain Free Cereal (gluten-free), Homemade Granola,Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal& Qia from Natures Path.10. Juice That Is Full of Junk!My 9 year old went from a juicebox a day to water. She sometimes asks for juice but when I look at the ingredients i put it right back. ~ AnaCorn syrup!! They put this in juices. Lol. ~ LorraineNaked juice, just crushed! ~ TawnyPasteurization kills all the benefits of orange juice and real fruit juice :( ~ CarolNatural Flavoring = corn and/or corn derivative to which I am highly allergic. I am not allergic to apples or cranberries; however, I had to take a Benadryl after drinking Motts-advertised and Ocean Spray-advertised 100% pure juices. I reported this to the FDA requesting that these juice companies cease advertising their juices as 100% pure. ~ DianeMost orange juices now have natural flavors! That is just crap! We dont need this crap in our orange juice! ~ NanNaked juice Something thats supposed to be great for you is full of junk. ~ KateAll the crap in kids juice drinks. ~ HeatherMost of the juice at the store is just glorified sugar water. Theyre oftenmade from concentrates, which means that the fresh juice has been heated down to syrup and reconstituted with water. During the concentration process, natural nutrients and flavors are lost, so they add those back in artificially. Even 100% Juice often contains proprietarynatural flavors that may be derived from anything natural, including animals. The juice is then heated up a second time to be pasteurized, which also denatures enzymes and destroys nutrients. So, after all that processing,its really not worth the money. Better Alternatives: Suja Essentials Linethat is cold-pressed and organicor try making your own, thisRavishing Red Juiceis a great one to start with!

32,CONFIRMED! Lab tests show over 30+ popular food products contain GMOs. Are you eating them?,http://foodbabe.com/2014/10/10/confirmed-lab-tests-show-over-30-popular-food-products-contain-gmos-are-you-eating-them/,"This week headlines about GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) splashed all over major media outletsacross the country. This media firestorm was in response to a new report released by Consumer Reports regarding GMOs in American food products. This report finally shared what I have thought all along: Non-labeled food products most likely contain GMOs if the ingredients include a corn or soy byproduct.Before I get into the shocking results of the report, I want to share with you why I personally try to avoid GMOs in my diet:There are no mandatory safety assessments required before GMOs are introduced into our food system.GMOs have contributed to more toxic pesticide usage since their inception. I want the pollution of our earth to stop. The types of environmental chemicals we are being exposed to are what the Presidents Cancer Panel says will destine 41% of us to get cancer in our lifetime.There areno long term human studies to prove GMOs are safe.GMOs are responsible for killing beecolonies. Without bees, we are in big trouble.I could go on with more reasons, but one in particular is very personal. I used tosuffer from some of the worst allergies. I have been hospitalized multiple times because of them. I used to be on several prescription drugs to control them too. When I removed GMOs from my diet, eating a majority of organic whole, unprocessed foods, my allergies vanished and was able to stop taking all myprescription medications. I feel like I have ten times more energy now and feel incredible. For this reason alone, I take avoiding GMOs very seriously.GMOs are running rampant in our food supply Earlier this year, the Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Center sent out secret shoppers to purchase more than 80 processed food products in New York and Seattle, which includeda wide range of products all containing corn or soy ingredients: breakfast cereals, bars, corn chips, corn tortillas, baking mixes and flours, baby formulas, meat substitutes, soy dairy products, and tofu/tempeh products. Then, theytestedthese productsto see if they contained any GMOingredients, and if so, how much. This is important because the overwhelming majority of processed food in America contains corn orsoy ingredients, which are also the most prevalent genetically modified crops, yet most major food manufacturers are strongly against labeling GMO ingredients. We are being left in the dark in this country, and virtually theonly way to know whether a product contains GMOs is to have it tested  and thats exactly what Consumer Reports did. What I love abouttheir reportis that Consumer Reports essentially just slapped a big fat GMO label on a few dozeneveryday food products here in America, including many that are considered Natural and healthy. The manufacturers of these foods do not want you to know that their products contain GMOs andhavecollectively spent millions of dollarsto fight against labeling laws, depriving us of our right to know. This is outrageous considering that92% of American consumers want GMO labels on foodand are becoming increasingly aware of how prevalent GMOshave become in our food supply.TheNatural Label: Its a sham.Consumer Reports tested several products thatare labeled as Natural because they found that the majority of Americans still believe that the Natural label means that they are non-GMO. AsIve written aboutin the past, the word Natural on a product means absolutely nothing in regards to GMOsthe FDA hasfailed to definethe use ofthis termwhich allows food manufacturers to deceptivelylabel their products as Natural to trickus into thinking their product is betterthan the others on the shelf. Consumer Reports notes that,Consumers who want to avoid GE ingredientsshould notrely on products labeled natural to avoid GMOs. This label is highly confusing and generallymisleading for consumers and Consumer Reports is asking the government to ban its useon food. They should because GMOsare not natural. As put by theInstitute for Responsible Technology: A GMO (genetically modified organism) is the result of a laboratory process where genes from the DNA of one species are extracted and artificially forced into the genes of an unrelated plant or animal. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects, animals or even humansWith genetic engineering, scientists can breach species barriers set up by nature. For example, they have spliced fish genes into tomatoes. The results are plants (or animals) with traits that would be virtually impossible to obtain with natural processes, such as crossbreeding or grafting.Yet, GMOsremain in Natural foods all over the country. Consumer Reports found that some Natural products contained similar amounts of GMOs as theircounterparts without a natural label. For instance, they found substantial quantities of GMO corn or GMO soy in popular Natural foods such as Kashi GoLean Honey & Cinnamon hot cereal (owned by Kelloggs),Utz All Natural Multigrain Tortillas, and Nature Valley Crunchy Oats N Honey Granola Bars (owned by General Mills).From Consumer Reports  Products guilty of using GMOs(A-Z):Betty Crocker Authentic Cornbread & Muffin MixBoca Original Vegan Veggie BurgersCorn Tortillas/Tortilla FlourDoritos Oven Baked Nacho CheeseEnfamil ProSobee Soy Infant FormulaGeneral Mills Cocoa PuffsGeneral Mills Corn ChexGeneral Mills KixGeneral Mills TrixGerber Good Start SoyJiffy Corn Muffin MixKashi GoLean (in the process ofof getting Non-GMO project verified)Kashi GoLean Hearty Honey & Cinnamon (Hot Cereal)Kelloggs Froot LoopsKelloggs Special K Protein Chocolatey Peanut Butter Granola Snack BarKrusteaz Natural Honey Cornbread & Muffin MixLa Banderita Corn TortillasMaseca Instant Corn Masa FlourMission White Corn TortillasMission Yellow Corn TortillasMorningStar Farms Chikn NuggetsMorningStar Farms Grillers California Turky BurgerNature Valley Crunchy Oats N Honey Granola BarsNature Valley Protein Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate Chewy BarNice!

Most disturbingly, all soy-based infant formulas they tested (thatare not labeled organic) are made with GMO soy, which includedEnfamil Prosobee, Gerber Good Start, Similac Go and Grow, and Similac Soy Isomil. If you are looking for the safest baby formula, be sure to check out this full investigation.Unverified Non-GMO claims: Dont fall for it.One of the most shocking things that Consumer Reports uncovered is thatXochitl Totopos de Maiz original corn chips (the non-organic variety) contain on averagemore than 75%GMO corn, although theyclaim right on the front of the bagthat they contain no GMOs. Consumer Reports tested 6 packages of non-organicXochitl chipsfrom different lots and found GMOs in every single one. These chips arentverified by the Non-GMO project, but theycontain the misleading statements All Natural and No GMO on the package. This just goes to show that becausethere are no regulations in place to ensure that non-verified claims can be trusted, the only way to be certain that youre avoiding GMOs is to look for the verified seal or 100% certified organic food. Most of theproducts that Consumer Reportstestedwithouta Non-GMO Project Verified or Certified Organic label contained GMO ingredients with few exceptions. Consumer Reportsconcluded that the USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project sealis reliable. This is why I do not purchase products that contain high-riskGMO ingredients without a 100% certified organic orNon-GMO Project Verified label. Tipsto use this information andavoid GMOs at the grocery store:Neverbuy products purely based onNaturalor100% All Naturallabel claims. Look for 100% Certified USDA Organic labels on food.Dont blindlytrust a non-GMO ingredient label claim that is not verified with aNon-GMO project seal or verification of 3rd party testing or certified organic. Read ingredient labels andwatch out for this list ofcommon GMO ingredients, particularlyanything derived from corn, soy, canola, cottonseed, sugar beets, papaya, zucchini and squash.Do not buy any products thatConsumer Reports verified contains GMOs(see the complete list fromtheir reportabove).Consumer Reports supports mandatory GMO labelingDespite this consumer demand, there are no requirements for labeling genetically engineeredingredients in processed foods and there is extremely limited safety testing required. Without labeling, there is a lack of transparency in the marketplace and Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, is actively engaged in a campaign to have foods with GE ingredients (also known as Genetically Modified Organisms or GMOs) labeled. In the meantime, consumers are unable to make informed purchasing decisions.Consumer Reports dispel many of the myths (and lies) circulating about GMOs, such as:GMOs arenecessary to feed the world(FALSE)it is interesting to note that the world already produces more than enough food to feed all its inhabitants. Hunger, whether in the US and or other parts of the world, is not caused by an insufficient quantity of food being grown. Rather it is caused by disparities in wealth, waste, wars, and market inefficienciesLooking at the long term outlook, GE foods may actually threaten food availability and increase food costs.GMOs are required to undergo pre-market safety testing by the FDA(FALSE)FDA, which regulates food safety, does not require any safety assessment of the GE crops, but invites companies to provide data for a voluntary safety review. This is in contrast to other major economies such as European Union, Australia, Japan, and China, which all require that a premarket mandatory safety assessment of GE crops is conductedGMOs are safe for the environment (FALSE)GE crops can have a significant negative impact on the environment. Although the industry often claims that GE crops reduce pesticide use, in fact the opposite istrueThe vast increase in herbicide use, especially glyphosate (trade name RoundUp), has caused weeds to become resistant to them, and this chemical is losing its effectivenessIn addition, studies suggest that glyphosate-tolerant crops and the use of glyphosate are likely more responsible for the large decline in monarch butterfly populations than are declines in the overwintering habitat in Mexico, since this herbicide use is wiping out most of the milkweed, which the Monarch butterfly depends on for food.GMOs have been proven safe to eat (FALSE)There is global scientific agreement that genetic engineering has the potential to introduce allergens and toxins in food crops, to change the nutritional value, and to create other unintended changes that may affect human health.The tide is beginning to turn in this country  I can feel it! The more knowledgeable we become about the use of GMOs in our food, the more quickly we will get transparency. When we voice our opinion to these companies, they have proven time and again that they are willing to change  and they have. Consumer Reports noted that,between testing and publishing of this report, that there were manufacturers who were obtaining or obtained Non-GMO Project Verified certification. This demonstrates an actively changing market that seems to be respondingto consumer demand. There are few things you can do to help keep this moving in the right direction:If you live in Oregon or Colorado, cast your vote in favor of GMO labeling this November. More information can be found on the Oregon Right to Know and the Colorado Right to Know websites.If you know someone who lives in Oregon or Colorado, call them, facebook them, tweet them or go visit them and ask them to cast their vote in favor of GMO labeling.If you live elsewhere, contact your state legislators and tell them you support mandatory labeling of GMO food.Join the Food Babe Army here its completely free and youll be the first to know about any new investigations.Spread the word bysharing this post with everyone you know.Thank you for your commitment to a more transparent food system.We have the right to know what we are eating!Vani105K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

33,You’ll Never Guess What’s In A Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte (Hint: You Won’t Be Happy),http://foodbabe.com/2014/08/25/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/,"Updated 4/6/2015 (see bottom of post)I really love the smell of pumpkin (especially in the Fall), but, there is at least one seasonal pumpkin treat that I will never order and thats the StarbucksPumpkin Spice Latte. Withmore than 200 million sold to date, these drinks sell like hotcakes this time of year, andStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz saidit still ranks as its most popular seasonal beverage.But, does anyone know whats really in it?I found out, and Im going to break it all down for you here. But first, I want to mention that I get riled up when restaurants refuse todisclose their ingredients, because we have the right to know whatwe are eating and drinking. Ive tried for years to get ingredient information from Starbucks and its been a bit frustrating to say the least. If youve ever tried emailing their customer service for ingredients you probably know what Im talking about.This week, we emailed them asking for the complete list of ingredients in the Pumpkin Spice Latte and this was their response:The Pumpkin Spice Latte is of pumpkin and traditional fall spiceflavors combined with espresso and steamed milk, topped with whippedcream and pumpkin pie spice. If you ever have any questions or concerns in the future, please donthesitate to get in touch.After severalmore emails back and forth, they were still refusingto share the ingredients:While we understand that some customers would like to know the nutrition information for their specific customized beverage, unfortunately we are unable to provide this level of detail for every beverage customization request. The beverage information that is available on Starbucks.com reflects the beverage offerings currently on our menu with the most common customization options. For a company that prides itself in its transparency, its unbelievable to me that this is how they respond to customers who ask for information about whats in their drinks. After really putting the pressure on, I was finally able to get the complete list, but it wasnt easy. While theylist some ingredients on their website, they still do not list the ingredientsin their most popular items: their drinks! This includes all of their lattes, frappuccinos, macchiatos, smoothies, etc. Starbucks doesnteven publish the ingredients in their Kids Drinks keeping parents completely in the dark. If you have a food allergy, their allergen information isnt available online either.Hows that for transparency?Besides trying to get an employeeto spill the beans, pretty much the onlyway to getthe ingredients in their drinksis to go into their online store and search for each of the individual components that make up these drinks, but they are not all listed here. Quite frankly, this is a pain. This also requires you to know all of the components that make up the drink that you order. For instance, the Pumpkin Spice Latte isnt just espresso, syrup and milk. If you order it the usual way onthe menu, it contains espresso, pumpkin sauce, steamed milk (or soy milk), whipped cream and spice topping  and these each come with their own ingredient list. Another way to get ingredients is to email andcall customer service, or to ask a corporate contact at Starbucks (if youre lucky enough to know one like me). We used all of these avenues to get the ingredients in this drink, and you know what? We got different ingredients.Overall, the ingredients were similar, but there were slight differences. We initially called Starbucks customer service and they said that all of the syrups sold in theironline store are the same ones that are used in the restaurant, and that specificallythe Pumpkin Sauce is the same. The online version heresays Pumpkin Saucecontains high fructose corn syrup. They also divulged the ingredients in the whipped cream, spice topping, and soy milk. Shortly thereafter, we also received a response to our email inquiry and this is when things became shady.This timethe ingredient list they sent over didnt have anyhigh fructose corn syrup on it. Rather, it was replaced with sweetened condensed nonfat milk. After a couple email exchanges, they seemed to confirm that HFCS is an ingredient:Yes the sauce that we sell online at www.starbucks.com is that same sauce that we use in our stores. I understand you concerns about high fructose corn syrup being used in the Sweentened Condensed Nonfat Milk. Please be aware that product information is provided to us by the suppliers who manufacture food and beverage items for Starbucks Coffee Company. Variations may exist due to periodic changes in formulations. While we attempt to provide product information that is as complete as possible, product changes or new product introductions may cause this information to become outdated or incomplete. Products may vary from location to location.I wasnt done yet. I also contacted a PR rep at Starbucks whom I had been in contact with previously and asked her to send me the ingredients. According to her, The condensed milk is sweetened with sugar (no HFCS).As you can see, this makes for a very confusing customer experience, and I still dont really know if it contains high fructose corn syrup (or not).Why wont they just publish ingredients online and end the confusion?They obviously know what the ingredients are in each of their drinks, so I seeno reason for them to hold back frompublishing them (in their entirety) online just like they do for their food items. This would make it easy for their customers to know exactly what they are drinking. I believe the reason that theyre dragging their feet is because they dont want you to know about the harmful additives in their biggest selling items.Case In Point: Youll get 2 doses of Class IV Caramel Coloring in Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte.Youve probably heard me talk about caramel coloring before, and thats because I think its one of the mosthazardouschemicals being added to our food. Although it sounds harmless, food safety and consumer watch dog groups say it is not. There are fourdifferent types (classes) of caramel coloring and twoof those types contain the dangerous substance4-methylimidazole (4-Mel). Starbucks uses Class IV Caramel Color, considered the most harmful typethat contains 4-Mel,in many of their drink syrups and sauces. Its even in their whipped cream! Why Starbucks should stop using Class IV Caramel Coloring immediately:Its created in a laboratoryby reacting corn sugar with ammonia and sulfites under high pressure and temperature, which produces the byproduct4-Mel.A U.S government funded study found that feeding mice caramel coloring IV (which contained 4-Mel)increased their risk of developinglung cancer and leukemia,at every dosage level.The International Agency for Research on Cancerclassifies4-Mel aspossibly carcinogenic to humans.Any food or drink thatcontains more than 29 micrograms of 4-Melrequires a cancerwarning label In California (under Prop 65) that says, WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) petitioned the FDA to bancaramel coloring in 2011 due to safety concerns and the cancer risk of allowing this ingredient in our food.It has no nutritional benefits and is only used cosmetically to improve the appearance of food and drinks, yet thereare safer alternatives available to food manufacturers.Its sometimesadded unnecessarily to food and drinks that are naturally brown or that are not even visible to the consumer (e.g. baby vitamin drops).Its the most widely used food coloring in the world, which makes it easy to consume excessive amounts.Thankfully, the FDA iscurrently reviewingitssafetyand GRAS status,due to aConsumer Reports studythat found excessive levels in many popular drinks.In previous correspondence with Starbucks, they told me they have no plans to remove the ingredient and, in all instances where the color is used in our beverages, the level is well below the No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) allowed by Californias Prop 65, regarded as a conservative evaluation system, and safe to consume. I havent seen any testing results that show the exact levels of 4-Mel found in Starbucks drinks, so we just have to take their word for it on this one. Also, even if the level is below whats allowed, what if someone has a Vente (Starbucks largest size) with the double dose of caramel coloring within the syrup and whipcream  whats the amount of caramel coloring then? Even if the levelsare below whats permitted in California, its still not safe. In the opinion of toxicologist Dr. UrvashiRangan, There is nosafe level of 4-MeI, but if youhave set athreshold, it shouldbe well below the Prop 65 level (29 micrograms/day)  and more like3 micrograms/day.Roasted coffee itself has been shown to contain trace amounts of 4-Mel. Couple that with the fact that this coloring is in just about every processed food you can imagine, so you may be cumulativelyeating more of this stuff than you realize  and no amount is safe. Would you really care if the syrup and sauces that they squirt into your coffee are colored brown? Its going into brown coffeeanyhow. its totally ridiculous to me that caramel coloring is even considered a necessary ingredient and that Starbucks doesnt ask their suppliers to completely remove it.Wheres the pumpkin?After reading the ingredients in the Pumpkin Spice Latte, I can tell you thattheresabsolutely no pumpkin. Instead, youll be drinking this:A Huge Dose of Sugar  A lot of it. Order up a non-fat grande and youll get served 50 grams of sugar. Is it apick-me-up from the caffeine, or all that toxic sugar?MonsantoMilk Even though over a hundred thousand customers are demanding it, Starbucks refuses to serve organic milk (at alllocations). Due to consumer pressure, they stopped using milk from cows injected with growth hormones several years ago, but their milk still comes from cows that are fed genetically modifiedfeed all day long  which is really supporting Monsanto and the biotech companies. When cows survive primarilyon acheap grain diet (corn, soy, alfalfa, cotton)its bad for the health of the animals, which is contributing to the overuse of antibioticsand the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If they made the switch to organic milk, or even offered it for that matter, it would ensure that it didnt come from cows grazing on GMO grains or injected with antibiotics.Pesticide Residue Starbucks doesnt serve organic coffee in most locations. Non-organic coffee is considered one of the heaviest chemically treated crops in the world, especially whenitsimportedfrom developing nations that allow pesticides that arerestrictedin the U.S. due to health concerns, such asChlorpyrifos.Natural and Artificial Flavors  Since this drink contains absolutely no pumpkin, this is where all that flavor comes from. The problem with both artificial and natural flavors is that their sources are proprietary and you never really know what they are made from.Preservativesand Sulfites  Which may cause allergic reactions orasthmaattacks, and is linked with DNA damage.If youre vegan, I have a specific warning for you.Many of you may beshocked to find out that whenyou order a Pumpkin Spice lattewith soy milk, its still not vegan. This is because the Pumpkin Sauce contains condensed nonfat milk, and many Starbucks employees dont realize this and have misinformed customers. This is yet another reason that Starbucks Corporate should be transparent about whats in their drinksby publishing complete ingredientsonline.Youll also get more than you bargained for if you order up a soy latte, because the Starbucks proprietary organic soy milk contains carrageenan  which is linked to gastrointestinal inflammation and cancer. It also contains another dose of addedsugar, preservatives and natural flavors.Complete Ingredients in Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte:Milk, Espresso (Water, Brewed Espresso Coffee), Pumpkin Spice Flavored Sauce (Sugar, Condensed Nonfat Milk, High Fructose Corn Syrup or Sweetened Condensed Nonfat Milk (Milk, Sugar), Annatto (for color), Natural and Artificial Flavors, Caramel Color (class IV), Salt, Potassium Sorbate (preservative)),Whip Cream(Whipping Cream, Starbucks Vanilla Syrup (Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Caramel Color (class IV)),Pumpkin Spice Topping: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg, Clove, Sulfites.SOY OPTION:Starbucks Organic Soy Milk (plain):Filtered Water, Organic Whole Soybeans, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Calcium Carbonate, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt, Carrageenan, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Vitamin B12, Zinc Gluconate.Starbucks Organic Soy Milk (vanilla): Filtered Water, Organic Whole Soybeans, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Calcium Carbonate, Natural Vanilla Flavors, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt, Carrageenan, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Vitamin B12.Ditch the Starbucks and Drink This Instead!Mama Natural has a version of ahomemade pumpkin spice lattethat actually uses real pumpkin!

Hopefully in the near future, we can have treats like these without worrying about the toxic chemicals in them!Xo,VaniUpdate 4/6/2015: I received an email from Starbucks representatives that they have started to remove caramel coloring level IV. we recently transitioned the vanilla syrup in our US and Canada stores to a new formula which is free from caramel coloring. We prioritized vanilla as it is an ingredient in our whipped cream, so with this one change we removed caramel coloring from many beverages. We are actively working on the rest and dont have a specific timeline to share at this time.

34,"What To Bring On Your Flight, So You Never Get Stuck Eating Airport Food Ever Again!",http://foodbabe.com/2014/06/27/healthy-airport-food/,"If you know me, you know I love to travel, but theres one thing about travel that gets me worked up every time. There are millionsof people coming in and out of the airports across the world thinking they have no choice. They think theyhave to eat airport and airplane food because its the only thing available. They let their surroundings control their lives, their health, and the health of their families. I used to be one of these people. For years, I traveled for work, consulting at major financial institutions all over the United States going from city to city. I didnt know anything about the food I was eating and I felt terrible about myself  I was overweight, felt tired all of the time, my skin was a mess, and I was generally less productive. This is why I feel obligated to share the information I learned that changed my life forever. I cant just sit back and let this happen for so many people.This madness needs to stop. We have a choice! We are in control of everything we put in our mouths! Our bodies arenot trashcans for the industrial food system!Bring food with you to the airport & on airplanes!Im happy to say that I havent had to eat airport and airplane food in a long time. Airplane food is oftenheavily processed with tons of controversial additives and preservatives that dont fit into my healthy lifestyle. On my last flight, I posted some pictures of what I was eating and drinking on my Facebook page, and got a lot of questions. Many of you are wondering how I was able to bring my own food on board and wanted details. Its easy to do, but it does take a bit of prep time and you have to make sure that what you bring wont get confiscated by the TSA at the security checkpoint.TSA lets you bring food through security.In the United States and in most countries, the transit authorities allows you to bring food through the security screening and onboard. Here are some items that work well and dont get confiscated:Homemade sandwiches wrapped in parchment paper stored in a quart-sized plastic bag. Keep in mind that all food that you carry on will need to go through the x-ray machine at the checkpoint. So, never use any foil. They will want to search your bag and delay your travels.Dips and sauces, such as hummus, salsa and almond butter, as long as it is in a 3.4 oz (or smaller) container, and put into a quart-sized plastic bag.Fresh fruits and veggies, such as apples, bananas and avocados. Just wash them at home or in your hotel room before you put them in your bag. If you cut or peel them ahead of time, of course they need to be wrapped in a plastic bagor put in a glass container. Keep in mind that you can also bring a butter knife to slice ripe avocados and bananas on the plane.Crunchy snacks such as crackers, popcorn, kale chips, etc.Dried fruit and raw nuts make a great snack on the plane. I like to make my own mix  1/2 cup each of raw almonds, coconut flakes, dried cherries or raisins, and raw walnuts. The airport usually has trail mix, but it comes loaded with inflammatory oils, other additives and are usually not raw or organic.Pre-made salads in glass containersor BPA-free plastic. Salad dressing can be packed separately as long as its in a 3.4 oz. or smaller container. However, I find that its easier to bring it already mixed into a salad or at the bottom of the bowl for mixing in later. (Just dont forget to bring a fork!)Empty thermos and empty water bottles  any size. These are great for filling up after you get through security.Tea bags for making hot tea in the airport before you board. Dont use the hot water on the airplane. Its not as clean as you would like, try to get it from a cafe in the airport before boarding.If you are traveling with your child: baby food, breast milk and formula are exempt from the 3.4 oz. rule and you can bring those on the plane in any quantity needed. Green juice in mini ball jar containers packed in a cooler to stay fresh.In addition to this list  Check out this app on the TSA website to search for what items may (or may not be) currently allowed in your carry-on. Tips for packing your carry-on bag:Most people dont think about this, but you can pack a cooler as one of your carry-on bags. There are some great travel coolers available, and even some that are on wheels that easily go through security for long flights or if you are traveling with family. Just make sure that it meets thesize requirements for the airline that you are flying on. These are two of my favorites:eBags Crew Cooler  Designed to fit over your carry on luggage as your second bag and comes in many different colors. Perfect for in-flight food.Available on Amazon for ~$49 here.Coleman Wheeled Travel Cooler  This cooler has a hard plastic liner, which is good for either taking as your carry-on bag orchecking in with your luggage at the airport. Available on Amazon for ~$41.23 here.I drink a lot of water, especially when traveling. Try packing a large empty water bottle and fill it up after going through security. Make sure you fill it up before you get on the plane, becauseIve found that some airlines wont do it for you.Pack an extra empty plastic bag and fill it with ice from a restaurant after you get through security to keep your cooler cold. Ive never had a problem asking for free ice, they will gladly provide it. Some airports have food courts, where you can just help yourself too.I personally havent had any trouble bringing in frozen gel ice packs, so you can try it  but there is a possibility that they would be confiscated. So, an extra bag for ice is a good back up plan.For longer flights, pack some frozen food in your cooler. If you pack some frozen berries or yogurt in small containers, it will help to keep your cooler cool and slowly defrost during your flight.If you find yourself in a bind or didnt have time to pack food, dont worry. There is fresh food available if you look for it. Many airports have a Jamba Juice, where you can pick up wheatgrass shots and some juice bars even offer fresh squeezed green juice or cold pressed juice in bottles (Yeah! San Fran airport!). You can always find fresh fruits (bananas, apples) and raw unsalted almonds in a store or restaurant at the airport. Check out this Farmers Market stand with plenty of real food options I found in terminal E of the Charlotte Airport:I have anextensive list hereof easy to pack snack foods that you can easily toss in your bag and take through security.If you are traveling internationally, only bring enough food for your flight in your carry-on because you will likely need to throw away any leftover food when you arrive at customs in your destination country. Before you leave, reviewthecustoms restrictions for your destination, to see what you may be able to bring into the country you are visiting.I like to fill my thermos with about 3 inches of slicedraw ginger before packing it in my carry-on bag. After you go through security, fill it up with hot water from a restaurant and youve got hot ginger tea for your flight! Ginger tea improves circulation, reduces inflammation, and is antibacterial  everything you need on a flight. Ive been using the Think Sport insulated bottles  which come in two sizes for my tea. They are available herewith 10% off affiliate code: FOODBABE10 if youd like to get one!    4.7 from 13 reviews   Food Babe's In Flight Ginger Tea     Print     Prep time  2 mins    Total time  2 mins      Serves: 1   Ingredients  3 inch piece of ginger root Empty insulated water bottle like ThinkSport     Instructions  Wash, peel and slice ginger root Place ginger root in an empty insulated bottle Fill with hot water after going through security - any cafe will gladly do this for free or sometimes for a dollar. (If you get it free, don't forget to leave a tip). Enjoy hot ginger tea while you travel, on flight or anywhere!     Notes You can refill your bottle again with hot water after you land - the ginger will last for another serving! Please choose organic ingredients when possible.   3.2.2708 Recipes that travel well for your flight:Salads  Thesepack well, especially if they have some grains in them such as quinoa to help keep the greens from getting wilted. When packing a basic salad, layer the salad in a glass container with the dressing on the bottom, followed by the grains, and then layer the greens on top. Just stir it up on the plane right before eating. Of course, this will need to be packed in a cooler with some ice to keep it from going bad if you dont eat it right away. Melt in Your Mouth Kale Salad RecipeQuinoa Tabbouleh Salad RecipeGazpachowith avocado on topWraps  My absolute favorite thing to pack fora flightis a wrap, filled with lots of fresh veggies and greens.

36,Healthy Holiday Granola {Perfect For Anytime Of The Year!},http://foodbabe.com/2013/12/17/healthygranola/,"Im so excited to share the healthy holiday granola I am giving to friends and family this season! (If you are my friend or family member that is going to get one of these  sorry for ruining the surprise!) This granola makes the perfect breakfast to replace cereal or snack and/or holiday gift. I used my basic recipe for granola but purposely chose pistachios and red dried fruits like cherries, goji berries and cranberries for the ingredients to create a festive look.This granola recipe is really perfect to make anytime of year  not just the holidays and sure does beat the overly processed kind you buy at the grocery store that is full of refined sugar, inflammatory oils, and added artificial or natural flavoring.To create the gift containers, I used leftover Lunas Living Kitchen Juice Glass Jars and brushed off the glue gun to glue some pretty ribbon around the bottles to cover up their logo. I could have easily bought inexpensive mason jars, but was looking forward to reusing these all year long  I drink A LOT of their organic raw juice! I still have many jars left that I havent used and plan to use them all year round (think baby showers, bridal showers, kids parties, etc all you need to do is change the ribbon and out comes the perfect party favor!)Word to the wise: Make sure you add dried fruit in after baking, this will keep them from drying out too much, keeping them yummy and chewy. This is especially true for goji berries.    4.9 from 13 reviews   Food Babe's Healthy Holiday Granola     Print     Prep time  5 mins    Cook time  60 mins    Total time  1 hour 5 mins      Serves: 10   Ingredients  3 cups rolled oats 2 cups of raw nuts of your choice (I used pistachios and almonds)  cup shredded unsweetened coconut 1 tbsp vanilla  cup coconut oil melted  cup maple syrup  teaspoon sea salt 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon  cup dried cherries, goji berries or cranberries     Instructions  Preheat oven to 250 degrees Combine all ingredients except for dried fruit and mix well Place mixture on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper Bake for 1 hour (stirring every 20 mins so all sides evenly brown) Remove granola from oven and let cool Stir in dried fruit Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks     Notes ***Please choose all organic ingredients if possible***   3.2.2124 Hope you share this recipe with friends and family this holiday season and all year round Cheers!

39,How To Find the Safest Organic Infant Formula,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/28/how-to-find-the-safest-organic-infant-formula/,"I am honored to share this guest post by Charlotte Vallaeys, former of Director of Farm and Food Policy at the Cornucopia Instituteand now a Senior Analyst within theConsumer Safety and Sustainability Programat Consumers Union. This isthe truth about organic infant formulas that currentlyexiston the market today and something that needs to be read by every mother-to-be, mothers and fathers everywhere.Unfortunately, choosing an infant formula that is organic is not enough  you must look deeper and understand the ingredients manufacturers are using in their products. Charlotte shares the exact ingredients you need to look out for and how to find the safest organic infant formula available. She holds Masters degrees from Harvard University and Tufts Universitys Friedman School of Nutrition.Some of my favorite memories of my sons as babies (which was not that long agothey are 2 and 4 years old) involve breastfeeding. It is a truly magical and priceless bonding experience. And for someone who loves good, real food as much as I do, there could be nothing more satisfying and empowering than that tingling feeling that accompanies the milk ducts springing into action to produce fresh milk, full of just the right mix of enzymes, nutrients, antibodies, hormones, and other beneficial components that have yet to be discoveredthe product of millions of years of evolution, specially made for my baby to ensure hell grow and thrive.But we also faced many obstacles along the way. The challenges started in the hospital with my firstborn and continued up to the moment my lastborn sipped his last drop of human milk.My oldest, Liam, would not latch on at first. I had expected breastfeeding to be easyit was, after all, so naturalbut there I was, a brand new mom with an hours-old baby, struggling to get my newborn to latch on. Those first hours of motherhood ushered in the realization that, in parenthood, not everything will go as planned.After involving many contraptions, including a hospital-grade breast pump, specialized bottles, and a silicone nipple shield, and many different nurses and lactation consultants advice (not to mention a lot of maternal determination), we finallyafter a couple of daysmade it work.When Liam was 9 weeks old, I discovered blood in his diaper and disregarded our pediatricians advice to switch from breastfeeding to hypoallergenic formula (she claimed he was allergic to milk, including his mothers milk). Instead, I continued breastfeeding but cut all dairy and soy out of my diet until Liams first birthday.Among other challenges, we weathered two bouts of painful mastitis and many days of separation for work-related trips that required a freezer full of pumped milk.The challenges continued until the very end, and unfortunately, my final memories of breastfeeding are also the most painful. When he was 9 months, my second son, Kai, decided to wean on his own. I had heard about self-weaning, and until I was faced with an uninterested and stubborn infant, I thought it was just a clever excuse for mothers to switch to more convenient formula feeding. Again, it was a stark reminder that many things about parenthood are easier said than done, and so much of what happens on this journey is entirely out of our control.I suppose I was more stubborn than Kai, and he eventually became hungry and thirsty enough that he would feed. But he responded by reluctantly drinking and then ending the session with a bite. After a couple of weeks of very tenseand often painfulfeeding sessions, I switched to pumping and giving my milk to Kai from a bottle. I grimaced every time I saw him bite down on that rubber nipple. Eventually, after a couple more weeks, I produced no more milk, and that bottle needed something in it for the remaining weeks until we could switch to organic whole milk.All this baby-feeding drama happened while I worked as a researcher and policy analyst with The Cornucopia Institute. Cornucopia acts as a watchdog for the organic community. As I carefully read labels in the baby food aisle of my local food store, I couldnt help but notice numerous violations of the organic standards. I avoided these baby foods with multiple unapproved synthetic ingredients. Meanwhile, Cornucopia took a leading role in advocating for the removal of unnecessary or potentially harmful synthetics from organic formula and baby food.This blog post is for parents, grandparents and others who want more information on organic infant formula. Id like to share what I learned both as Policy Director at Cornucopia and as a mom looking for the best food for my own babies.Without a doubt, human milk and factory-produced infant formula dont compare, as human milk is far superior in so many respects, including in ways we will probably never fully comprehend. We can all agree on that. But in parenthood, many things dont go as planned, and for many committed, food-conscious, organic-buying parents, that includes breastfeeding.I will only cover organic formula, and I hope that readers will understand that while there are many problems in this segment of the organic industry, organic formula is still a far better choice than conventional formula, with its genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), milk from cows that were likely treated with antibiotics or artificial growth hormones, and oils that were processed with the use of neurotoxic solvents like hexane. Major ingredients in conventional formula are derived from crops that were sprayed with harmful pesticides and herbicides in the field and likely fumigated in storage.Organic formula offers an alternative, but it is far from perfect. I hope that parents will find the information here useful if faced with the tough decision to turn to formula. The Organic Formula IndustryIf you need formula and cant make your own, you likely want to know how to purchase the best one.While there are seven brands of organic infant formula currently available on market shelves, there are only three companies that make organic infant formula in the United States.One manufacturer is PBM Nutritionals, owned by Perrigo. At $3 billion in annual sales, Perrigo is the worlds largest manufacturer of private label (store-brand) over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. PBM primarily produces conventional formula, but makes organic formula for its own Vermont Organics and Bright Beginnings brands. It also manufacturers organic formula for Hain Celestials Earths Best brand, Whole Foods Markets 365 Organic brand, and Walmarts Parents Choice brand.Similac Organic is manufactured by Abbott Laboratories. Abbott, a major manufacturer of pharmaceuticals in the U.S., introduced Similac Organic in 2006. By 2007, its first full year on sale, Similac Organic captured 36% of the organic formula market. Abbotts Similac is a market leader in conventional formula.Finally, Babys Only Organic is developed and marketed by Natures One. Natures One markets Babys Only Organic formula as a toddler formula rather than an infant formula (according to the company, this is done to encourage breastfeeding until age 1). Its products meet the same nutritional standards that the FDA sets forth for infant formula. Natures One is the only company marketing organic formula that is not a publicly traded corporation; the business is family-owned and operated.Top five ingredients to take a close look at  how do organic brands compare?1. Sweeteners: corn syrup, sugar, or brown rice syrupFormula manufacturers strive to formulate a product that mirrors the nutritional profile of human milk. Human milk contains higher levels of lactose, a carbohydrate, than cow milk, which means that formula manufacturers must make up the difference by adding a sweetener to cow milk-based formula.But in their choice of sweetener, it appears that concerns over the availability and price of the various sources have taken precedence. The sweetener that most closely mimics human milk would be lactose (the naturally occurring carbohydrate in any mammals milk). But lactose is also the most expensive, and manufacturers have, over the years, switched from this milk-based sweetener to plant-based sweeteners.Corn syrupWhen PBM Nutritionals first rolled out its organic infant formula under the Bright Beginnings brand name, it contained only organic lactose, with no corn-based sweeteners. PBM soon produced the same product for Walmart, under the Parents Choice brand name, which also contained only organic lactose.But PBM Nutritionals switched from organic lactose as the sole sweetener for Bright Beginnings, and so did Walmarts organic formula, in 2010. Their formulations changed to include both organic corn syrup solids and lactose.By 2011, organic lactose in Bright Beginnings and Parents Choice had disappeared altogether, replaced by organic maltodextrin, another plant-based sweetener. Maltodextrins are partially hydrolyzed starch molecules, which can be derived from corn, rice or potatoes. Maltodextrin is less sweet than corn syrup.Today, Bright Beginnings, Parents Choice and Whole Foods 365 Organic contain no organic lactose at allonly plant-based (mostly corn-based) carbohydrates.A similar move away from organic lactose happened with Earths Best and Vermont Organics (again, both manufactured by PBM). In 2007, Earths Best infant formula contained only organic lactose as the added carbohydrate. When Vermont Organics entered the market in 2008, it mirrored Earths Best and also contained only organic lactose. By 2011, both Earths Best and Vermont Organics contained reduced amounts of organic lactose, which were replaced with organic glucose syrup solids.Organic glucose syrup solids is another name for organic corn syrup solids, which are partially hydrolyzed corn starch molecules that are dried to a low moisture powder (hence the name solids). Corn syrup solids are moderately sweet (sweeter than maltodextrin).BrandCompanyManufacturerCarbohydrate in 2013365 (Whole Foods) OrganicWhole Foods Markets, Inc.PBM NutritionalsOrganic Glucose Syrup Solids, Organic MaltodextrinBabys Only OrganicNatures OneNatures OneOrganic Brown Rice SyrupBright BeginningsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsOrganic Glucose Syrup Solids, Organic MaltodextrinEarths BestThe Hain Celestial GroupPBM NutritionalsOrganic Lactose, Organic Glucose Syrup SolidsParents Choice OrganicWal-MartPBM NutritionalsOrganic Glucose Syrup Solids, Organic MaltodextrinSimilac Organic Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott LaboratoriesOrganic Maltodextrin, Organic SugarVermont OrganicsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsOrganic Lactose, Organic Glucose Syrup SolidsSugarIn terms of the added sweetener, Abbott Laboratories took a different route for its Similac Organic product: sugar.Abbotts decision came under fire in 2008, when The New York Times reported on the various concerns regarding the use of sugar in infant formula. The Times even commissioned its own professional taste test. Similac Organic was the sweetest, with the sweetness of grape juice or Country Time lemonade, according to Gail Civille, the director of Sensory Spectrum, which performed the tests.The European Union banned sugar-sweetened infant formula in 2009, due to concerns with rising rates of childhood obesity and the possibility that overly sweet formula might lead to overfeeding. Sucrose (sugar) is allowed only in special formula for babies with allergies, and even then, it may not exceed 20% of the total carbohydrate content.The New York Times quoted Dr. Benjamin Caballero, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and an expert in risk factors for childhood obesity: I would be very concerned about this as a pediatrician. The issue is that sweet tastes tend to encourage consumption of excessive amounts. Evidence shows that babies and children will always show a preference for the sweetest food available, he said, and they will eat more of it than they would of less-sweet food. This is how breakfast cereal manufacturers compete, he added.Despite the concerns raised in The New York Times, Abbott Laboratories continues to use sugar as the added carbohydrate.Brown Rice SyrupNatures One chose organic brown rice syrup as the added carbohydrate for its toddler formula. In 2012, researchers at Dartmouth University tested various foods for levels of arsenic, and found organic toddler formula made with organic brown rice syrup contained up to six times the U.S. EPA safe drinking water limit for inorganic arsenic (there are no established safety standards for arsenic in food, including infant formula).In response, Natures One developed an organic-compliant technology to filter and remove inorganic arsenic from its organic brown rice syrup to undetectable levels.Consumers Union tested Babys Only Organic products to determine if the company had indeed removed arsenic from its products, and confirmed Natures Ones claims that its formula now contains undetectable arsenic levels2. Palm Oil: Forms Soaps In The Babys GutNot all oil is created equalits a basic fact of nutrition science, and one that is especially important for infants. Human milk is naturally high in certain types of fatty acids, which formula manufacturers try to mimic by adding certain types of oil. And to mirror the levels of palmitic acid, a fatty acid found in human milk, some manufacturers add palm oil.However, palmitic acid from palm oil is structurally different from palmitic acid in human milk, and research has shown that human infants do not properly absorb it.The unabsorbed palmitic acid remaining in the infants gut reacts with calcium, and causes the formation of soaps in the babys intestines. This important finding has been reported on more than one occasion in the journal Pediatrics, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.Research suggests that the formation of soaps in the babys intestinal tract negatively affects a babys development and health. Since palmitic acid from palm oil is not absorbed properly, it means overall fat absorption is lower in babies given formula with palm oil. Bone mass is significantly lower in babies given formula containing palm oil, perhaps because the calcium in the babys intestines turns into soap rather than reaching the babys growing bones. And the soapiness in the intestines also leads to hard stools.According to researchers at Wayne State University, who performed a comprehensive review of published studies on the effects of palm oil in infant formula:The use of palm oil ininfantformulas to match the human milk content of palmitic acid has unintended physiological consequences. The avoidance of palm oil  ininfantformulas can prevent this detrimental effect.Despite these concerns, all organic formula products coming out of the PBM Nutritionals factory continue to contain palm oil. Earths Best did not contain palm oil when it first came on the market, but switched to palm oil in 2007.BrandCompanyManufacturerContains Palm Oil?365 (Whole Foods) OrganicWhole Foods Markets, Inc.PBM NutritionalsYesBabys Only OrganicNatures OneNatures OneNoBright BeginningsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsYesEarths BestThe Hain Celestial GroupPBM NutritionalsYesParents Choice OrganicWal-MartPBM NutritionalsYesSimilac Organic Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott LaboratoriesNoVermont OrganicsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsYes(As if parents needed another reason to avoid Enfamil, which offers no organic option, the first oil listed in Enfamil is palm oil). 3. Ingredients extracted with neurotoxic solvents from algae and soil fungusnot exactly the way mom makes it C. Cohnii oil (DHA) and M. Alpina oil (ARA):Six years ago, Cornucopias codirectors asked me to look into two ingredients, C. Cohnii oil and M. Alpina oil. They are marketed as DHA and ARA, and were starting to appear in organic infant formula without having gone through the proper approval process required by federal organic law.The oils were manufactured by a biotechnology corporation in Maryland (the company has since been bought by the Dutch multinational corporation Royal DSM), using processing aids and synthetic ingredients that are not approved for use in organics.Fresh out of a graduate program in nutrition, I could not help but dig deeper. I have to admit: I didnt want to be involved in filing a legal complaint against ingredients that might be beneficial to infant development. I was concerned we might be depriving infants if we actually succeeded in having the USDA pull these ingredients out of organic infant formula (I clearly underestimated the power of the infant formula lobby that wed be up against).I soon discovered from the scientific literature that we wouldnt be harming babies at all if they didnt have these additives in their formula. If fact, wed be protecting them from potential harm. Studies repeatedly failed to show benefits from adding these additives to formula, and the FDA had been receiving dozens of reports from parents and pediatricians who noticed some babies do not tolerate these ingredients. In 2008, we filed a legal complaint.DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid, and ARA is an omega-6 fatty acid. Both are naturally found in human milk, and DHA is a component of brain and eye tissue. But the DHA and ARA added to most brands of infant formula are extracted from factory-produced C. Cohnii and M. Alpinaspecific strains of algae and fungus that have never been part of the human diet, let alone the diet of infants.Since we released our report and filed the legal complaint, it has become even clearer that these additives are not necessary and are primarily added as marketing tools. Three of the most prominent and respected independent scientists in the field of infant formula science stated in 2010 that the scientific evidence base for DHA and ARAs addition to infant formula is recognized by most investigators and Key Opinion Leaders in the field to be weak, and that this field of research has been driven to an extent by enthusiasm and vested interest.Several comprehensive reviews of all published research have been conducted since we released our report, and all conclude that DHA and ARA had no proven benefit regarding vision, cognition, or physical growth. The World Health Organizations Director of Nutrition for Health and Development even wrote a letter in 2011 to members of the European parliament, letting them know that as to date no solid evidence exists to be able to say that adding DHA to infant formula will have important clinical benefits.When an Associated Press reporter asked the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition, Dr. Frank Greer, to comment on DHA and ARA in infant formula, he said: The truth of the matter is, theyre not essential. Humans can synthesize these. Fatty acids are naturally present in the diet. And the whole issue becomes, do you make really make people smarter if you put DHA and ARA in everything? Or is this just all marketing hype? Personally, I lean toward the latter.When the C. Cohnii and M. Alpina oils first appeared in infant formula, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received dozens of reports from physicians and parents who noticed diarrhea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal distress in infants given formula with these oilssymptoms that disappeared when the infant was switched to the exact same formula without these novel additives.The FDA reports that no post-market surveillance has taken place to assure the safety and tolerance of these additivesdespite the FDAs clear request to the formula manufacturers to conduct rigorous post-market monitoring to ensure their safety.Another concern with these additives is how they are produced: the oil is extracted from the algae and fungus with the use of hexane, a neurotoxic petroleum-based solvent.When the USDA received legal complaints against the unapproved use of C. Cohnii and M. Alpina oils, a Washington lobbyist with the powerful law firm of Covington and Burling convinced USDA officials to open a loophole in the organic standards, which would allow the formula manufacturers to add the unapproved ingredients without facing enforcement action.While the USDA has since admitted that this was inappropriate, the agency has failed to take enforcement action and continues to bow to pressure from the infant formula industry. The National Organic Standards Board even explicitly stated that hexane-extracted algal oil and fungal oil should not be allowed in organic foods but the USDA has failed to act on this very clear and legally binding vote, and hexane-extracted DHA and ARA remains in organic infant formula.The only company that adheres to the legal requirement that DHA and ARA oil must not be extracted with the use of the neurotoxic solvent hexane is Natures One, which has chosen a water-extracted source of DHA and ARA (derived from egg yolks) for its Babys Only Organic formula.4. Carrageenan: Dangerous Inflammation In Your Babys GutIf you search for carrageenan in a medical database, thousands of search results will appear. Why so many? Because carrageenan is used in animal experiments to predictably cause inflammation, which allows pharmaceutical scientists to test the effectiveness of new anti-inflammatory drugs.In a report Cornucopia released earlier this year, we carefully analyzed the scientific literature on food-grade carrageenan, and found that scientists have raised concern about carrageenans safety for decades. These concerns are based on their research linking the common food additive to gastrointestinal disease in laboratory animals, including colon tumors.But the food industry, including the infant formula industry, has responded for decades by claiming that carrageenan is safebased largely on industry-funded studies, with flawed methodologies. When a Chicago Tribune reporter asked both the FDA and the carrageenan industry lobby group earlier this year to share studies that were not funded by the industry and that could indicate carrageenan is safe, they could not come up with a single one.Carrageenan appears in some organic infant formula, even though the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) voted to prohibit it. The Secretary of Agricultures decision to disregard the NOSBs decision shows the lobbying power and influence of the infant formula industry.Carrageenan is prohibited in infant formulaconventional and organicin the European Union. The science linking carrageenan to intestinal inflammation is disturbing enough, but what adds insult to injury is that it is entirely unnecessary. Carrageenan contributes no nutritional value or flavor to formula, or other food, but is added to stabilize ready-to-feed formula. Adding carrageenan means parents or caregivers do not have to shake the product before feeding it to the baby. The alternative is to put a shake well label on the bottle.Earths Best and Similac Organic ready-to-feed formula, the only liquid organic formula on the market, both contain carrageenan.5. Synthetic Preservatives and Nutrients In Organics: A Mirror-Image Of The Synthetics In Conventional FormulaFederal law requires that a synthetic ingredient cannot be added to organic products unless it has been reviewed and approved by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). Two synthetic preservatives and numerous synthetic nutrients have recently been rejected by the NOSB. Final rulemaking is pending. For now, they remain in some organic infant formula products.Some brands contain more of these unapproved synthetics than others.Synthetic PreservativesThe NOSB rejected two synthetic preservatives: ascorbyl palmitate and beta-carotene.One of the primary reasons why formula manufacturers add these synthetic preservatives is to prevent the algal DHA and fungal ARA oils from going rancid.Since Babys Only Organic is the only formula that does not contain algal DHA oil and fungal ARA oil, it also is the only formula that does not contain these two synthetic preservatives.Synthetic NutrientsThe National Organic Standards Board rejected the use of the following synthetic nutrients in dairy-based formula: lutein, lycopene, nucleotides, taurine, l-carnitine and l-methionine.None of these nutrients are required in infant formula by the Food and Drug Administration, and all are prohibited in organic formula in the European Union. Some, like lutein and lycopene, are even prohibited in conventional infant formula in the European Union.Luteinis produced from conventionally grown marigoldslikely treated with insecticidesand processed with the neurotoxic solvent hexane.BrandCompanyManufacturerContains Lutein?365 (Whole Foods) OrganicWhole Foods MarketPBM NutritionalsNoBabys Only OrganicNatures OneNatures OneNoBright BeginningsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsNoEarths BestThe Hain Celestial GroupPBM NutritionalsNoParents Choice OrganicWal-MartPBM NutritionalsNoSimilac Organic Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott LaboratoriesYesVermont OrganicsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsNoLycopene is most commonly found in tomatoes, but the version in organic infant formula is produced synthetically by the chemical manufacturer BASF.

It is utterly disturbing that the infant formula and baby food aisle would contain some of the most egregious violations of the organic standards.Even after the National Organic Standards Board voted to prohibit hexane-extracted DHA and ARA, carrageenan, two synthetic preservatives and six synthetic nutrients in organic infant formula, these unapproved ingredients remain in organic products on store shelves (lobbying efforts by the formula industry are apparently paying off).Some parents make their own infant formula (Weston A. Price foundation has a recipe). Human milk sharing is becoming more popular as well, with social media making it increasingly easy to connect donors and recipients (check out Human Milk 4 Human Babies and Eats on Feets).Other parents import organic formula from Europe, such as the Holle brand from Germany, since it does not contain any of the unapproved synthetic preservatives and nutrients (Holle still does contain palm oil and maltodextrin). In Europe, as in the U.S., these ingredients are prohibited, and manufacturers there follow the law.Dont babies in the U.S. deserve the same? When will the USDAs officials in charge of overseeing the organic label stop bowing to the lobbying pressure of the infant formula lobbyists, and enforce the organic law?Please Take Action and Share This PostLet the USDA know how you feel about their decision to continue allowing carrageenan in organic infant formula. You have until June 3rd to submit a comment through the governments portal (for the required field organization, enter citizen). While youre sharing your thoughts on carrageenan, you can also urge the USDA to remove the other unapproved synthetic ingredients from organic infant formula.Writing this post was not easy. As a parent, I wish I could tell other parents who are in a bind and who need formula that the organic label signifies a safe option without any of the harmful ingredients found in conventional formula. As this post has shown, thats not always the case.That being said, let me stress again that organic infant formula remains a safer and a far superior alternative to conventional formula. Organic formulas milk does not come from cows that were fed GMO feed, given antibiotics or injected with synthetic growth hormones. Organic formulas sweeteners and oils cannot be GMO, treated with pesticides or extracted with neurotoxic solvents. So the choice between organic or conventional formula is a no-brainer.Until we get unapproved ingredients out of organic infant formula, I hope this information will help parents make informed decisions when purchasing formula for their babies.More about Charlotte Vallaeys:Former of Director of Farm and Food Policy at theCornucopia Institute(when this post was written)and now a Senior Analyst within theConsumer Safety and Sustainability Programat Consumers Union.With a Master of Theological Studies degree from Harvard University and a Master of Science degree from Tufts Universitys Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Charlottes research explores the ethics of our food system.

40,How To Eat Organic On A Budget (Over 75 Tips!),http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/20/how-to-eat-organic-on-a-budget/,"The one tried and true worry I get about living an organic lifestyle is the cost. Its likely the only immediate downside because everything else about living organically is pretty magical. Remember, non-organic food often containscancer-causing hormones, immunity destroying anti-bioticsand dangerous pesticides.Pesticides bynature are designed to kill, they are poison. So when given the choice, I dont know why anyone could logically buy food with poison sprayed on it? Pesticides can cause neurological problems, cancer, infertility, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,allergies and asthma, wheezing, rashes and other skin problems,ADHD, birth defects and more. Thats why buying quality organic food and eating the most nutritious foods on the planet will save you BIG BUCKS down the road in medical costs, prescription drugs and doctor visitslike my friend Birke always says We can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital  Its totally up to us.Over 75 Tips On How to Eat Organic On A BudgetIn hopes to mitigate the initial money pains of buying organic, I want to share the top organic money saving ideas that Ive gathered from my friends and family members. And, let me tell you, I learned a lot myself while putting together this list and combining everyones tips into one cohesive guide. I cant wait to put some of these new ideas into practice.Let the savings begin!FIND AND USE ORGANIC COUPONSCheck the websites of your favorite companies for coupons and special promotions, almost all of them have some.Join your favorite companys social media pages for special coupons and deals.Checkout various organic coupon sites. Some of my favorite examples includeMambo Sprouts,All Natural SavingsandOrganic Dealsfor organic food/natural living coupons, and money savings ideas.Simply Organic who makes spices, seasoning mixes and baking mixes always have coupons on their websitehere sometimes more than a dollar off.Kroger has coupons orSimple Truth.Whole Foodshas couponshereevery week for various products throughout the store.Earth Fare has couponshereevery week for various products throughout the store.Most stores take each others coupons, so dont be afraid to use them all in one shopping trip at your most convenient or favorite store.AT HOME AND IN THE KITCHENStay organized. Plan out your meals for the week according to organic foods that are on sale and/or that you have coupons for.Budget. Write out a weekly and monthly budget to help you keep track of both erratic spending and responsible spending. This will allow you to see your spending habits and help you prioritize purchasing organic food within your budget.Do it yourself, rather than buy it. Make your own organic granola bars, kale chips, smoothies, juices to replaced store-bought with more overhead.Learn how to portion and prioritize  it is a necessity to always buy organic meats and dairy products, and, therefore, learn to portion your consumption of these products each week. For example, keep meat to 4 ounces or less per serving.Invest in a4 stage water filterinstalled directly under your sink to avoid having to buy bottled water. Also, check the Environmental Working Group guide on choosing the right water filter for you.Check out the book Wildly Affordable Organic for organic menu planning on $5 a day or less.USE YOUR FREEZER9 times out of 10 the organic frozen produce at the store is cheaper than fresh, especially if the fruit or vegetable is out of season.Freeze all left overs using inexpensive mason glass jars orsilicone ice moldsfor smaller portions.Freeze homemade cookie dough and other treats like almond freezer fudge, so you can have a treat ready to go in the appropriate portion size.Buy local produce when in season and freeze to save for out of season, for example in the spring and summer spread berries on a sheet pan and freeze overnight and then store in jars for the fall and winter.Double recipes and freeze leftovers, this works great with soups and stews.Freeze core kitchen staples like butter, cheese and bread scraps for bread crumbs or homemade croutons.MAKE CHOICESMeat & dairy (animals products like chicken, eggs, cheese, butter, yogurt, milk, etc.) are the most important to buy organic because of the combined risk of pesticide, anti-biotic and cancer causing growth hormone exposure. Whatever you do, do not skimp here.Reduce meat and dairy consumption if you cannot afford organic  One way to do this is tobe vegan before 6pm, as Mark Bittman explains in his latest book. For example, have a green smoothie for breakfast with ezekiel toast, and then a large salad with lentils at lunch or a wrap made with hummus and then at night choose high quality meat in small portions.Reduce amount of organic meat used by substituting half the portion with organic beans.Buy a whole organic chicken for less per pound, vs. just the breast, legs or wings which are more expensive per pound. You can use the carcass to make your own chicken broth.Use the Clean 15 and Dirty Dozen lists available on ewg.org to help you navigate which products to buy organic (or take with you when you travel).For example, if you have a choice between more expensive organic red peppers and less expensive conventional asparagus  choose the asparagus. Asparagus naturally repel pests allowing it to be grown with minimal pesticides. Include red pepper in your diet when it is in season or you can find it cheaper at another grocery store.Do not buy pre-washed and ready to eat fruits and veggies, as they can cost twice as much.Skip conventional Starbucks(and other coffee shops). Buy organic coffee and tea such as:Larrys Beans Organic CoffeeandNumiand make it yourself. This will actually save you time in the morning too.Eat out only twice a week  eating organic at home is significantly less expensive than eating at organic restaurants.BUY IN BULKTake advantage of the buy one get one free sales or buy one get the other for a discounted price. You never know when it will go on sale again, so make sure to take advantage of it and store for later use. (This trick only works if you really love the product and it is a staple at your home  otherwise this could lead to wasted food)Always buy packaged staples on saleBuy unpackaged foods from bulk dispensers  I personally save a ton of cash by doing this, I buy everything from oat groats, to nuts, to dried fruit and lentils.Bring measuring cups with you to the grocery store if you are buying from bulk containers. That way you can get exactly the amount you need for a specific recipe and you wont be paying for extra.Buy smaller organic spice packets or jars, old spices lose their medicinal qualities so it is smarter to buy in smaller quantities. For example, Earth Fare has little pre-portioned tiny ziplocs with herbs and spices available at the fraction of costs compared to a whole jar.Buy the whole animal and freeze the portions you dont use. I personally know someone who is on a budget and does this all the time. You can also do this by contacting your local farmer and then splitting the cost with a group.To satisfy a sweet tooth, skip the full size packages of candy and chocolate. Buy a few pieces in the bulk section, for example go for a few pieces of organic dried fruit or 10 chocolate covered almonds.Find out what foods are in season and buy those in bulk, as they are significantly cheaper.BUY ONLINEJoinThrive MarketThis website is like a health food store stocked up with non-GMO and organic groceries at drastically reduced prices (up to 25-50% off). Ive found that the quality of their products are always as good as what I can buy locally and they carry many of the brands I love and support.The way they work is similar to Costco because you need to join to shop, but their fee is really reasonable (works out to about $5 month). Ifyouve never shopped atThrive Market before, theyll give you your first month free so you can try it out and see if you love it as much as I do and theyll also give you25% off your first order.No code needed to get 25% off, justgo to this link.Amazon  One of my favorite shopping sites, because they basically have every brand available and ship free over $25.00.VitaCost  Another low cost website that has a wide variety of organic and healthy foods, vitamins, etc.Herbs Pro  Another low cost website that has a wide variety of organic and healthy foods, vitamins, etc.Before you check out online, visitRetail Me Not for online promotional codes and discounts for all your favorite online stores and sources.CHOOSE ORGANIC BRANDS THAT SAVE YOU MONEYChoose more inexpensive grocery store brand products like Trader Joes, Earth Fare, 365 brand, ShopRite, Wegmans, Kroger, Publix, Harris Teeter. Regardless of the brand, they are all required to follow the same guidelines set forth by the USDA organic certification program if they contain the USDA organic seal and chances are that you wont be able to tell the difference between a brand name and store brand.Join grocery store loyalty programs for discounts. For example, if you join Earth Fares tomato bank program, you get a dollar back for every 100 points you earn.Use your rewards cards always.

41,The Ingredients in Sunscreen Destroying Your Health,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/05/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-ever-buy-sunscreen-again/,"Your skin is your largest organ.It covers and protects everything on your body. How you treat it is incredibly important to your health. However, the skin is one of the most unappreciated organs, and one that I used to totally take for granted, slathering products full of toxic chemicals on it day after day. When I look back at all the different potions Ive tried, I shake my head in disbelief and wish I would have known better. Not only would I not have developed eczema all over my body and face, but I would have looked a million times better growing up.One of those products that has always caused me issues  is sunscreen. Every time after a beach vacation or going to the pool, Id end up with a rash on my face or body. I wondered if Id eaten something that I was allergic to. Little did I know at the time  the culprit was sunscreen.The unknown long-term consequences of the chemicals in sunscreen are just starting to be revealed and the results are shockingly horrific, going beyond the common skin rash. Here in the United States, the FDA does not regulate cosmetics as rigorously as pharmaceuticals or food  allowing cosmetic companies to get away with using all types of chemical ingredients that are not used and in some cases banned in other countries. Sounds familiar  eh? Sunscreen is supposed to protect us from harmful UV radiation from the sun, but as more people use sunscreen, the incidence of skin cancer continues to rise. This fact alone has to make you think  do sunscreens really provide skin cancer protection? Or could the chemicals in them actually be contributing to causing skin cancer?It gets complicated trying to answer those questions. Some studies have shown that sunscreens do in fact protect us from some types of less threatening forms of skin cancers, but others have found that sunscreens have actually contributed to the risk of some of the worst forms of skin cancers.So what do you do?I certainly dont want to look like a wrinkly old hag when Im older from laying out in the sun too long without protection  but I also dont want to increase my cancer risk by using products that could be harmful. Anti-aging is important to me and thats why I live the way I do  not only do I want to look my best when Im older, I want to feel my best too.Below are my favorite sunscreen brands that are rated between 0-2 for their entire line of sun care products and are the safest available. Ive included the links on where to find these brands online if you cant find them in stores near you  but most natural food stores and vitamin shops will have one of these options available.Badger Certified organic, several different SPFs and option for kids, babies and active people, unscented availableThinkbaby/Thinksport Great for athletes, kids and adults for prolonged exposure in sun.John Masters Organics SPF 30, only one option availableSeventh Generation SPF 30, only one option availableAubrey Organics SPF 26-45 available, unscented availableRaw Elements The first organic, non-GMO certified sunscreen. (Try the tinted stick for your face  its awesome!) Ive partnered with them to give you discount Get 10% with code:foodbabeSunology  Kids, Face and Body Protection  one of my favorites, because it glides in easilyCalifornia Baby(Target carries this brand)  Formulated for sensitive skin, SPF18-30*Note  Alba and Kiss My Face are two other brands that are safer than most conventional brands. However, you must only choose their mineral based products  for exampleAlbas Mineral SPF 30 UnscentedandKiss My Faces Mineral Lotion SPF 40are great choices  but other versions in the same brand category may not be as safe.There are over 1800 products on the market to choose from, making it incredibly confusing and difficult to pick the best and safest brand. Heres what you need to watch out for:Oxybenzone this is a hormone disrupting chemicalwhich penetrates the skin and enters the bloodstream. It is the most popular ingredient in chemical based sunscreens and only blocks UVB ray (suns good rays that provide vitamin D production), not UVA which are the most free radical damaging rays. Avoid any sunscreen that has this chemical at all costs, especially for children.Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate)  A 2009 study by U.S. government scientists released by the National Toxicology Program found when this is applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, it may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions.Fragrance  Sure it may make the product smell nice, but this is a petroleum based product that is linked to organ toxicity and allergies.High SPF  The FDA does not regulate SPF higher than 50 and theres no scientific proof they work better than lower SPF. Many of the higher SPFs do not provide any additional protection and studies have suggested that users are exposed to as many or more ultraviolet rays as those who use lower-SPF products.Sprays or Powders  Generally speaking, sprays and powders have additional chemicals added to them for performance purposes. These additional chemicals are usually not something you want to be spraying on your body and can be toxic to the lungs. Besides, remember sunscreen is formulated for your skin, not your lungs. Many of the side effects of sprays and powders on the lungs are not tested before being approved.Popular Conventional Brands Aveeno, Banana Boat, Coppertone Sport, Coppertone Water Babies, Bull Frog, Neutragena, Storebrands (CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens), Hawaiian Tropic and many other popular brands are rated the worst in terms of safety in theEnvironmental Working Groups Sunscreen Guide. You can use this guide to find out how good or bad the brand you have or want to buy is rated.How To Choose A Safe Sunscreen:Look fortitanium dioxide and zinc oxidebased mineral sunscreens, which do not penetrate the skin and provide UVA protection against the suns most damaging rays.Choose non-nano products that do not have small particles that can absorb into skinChoose sunscreens that are unscented or use essential oils as fragrancePick lotion based sunscreens with water resistancePick broad spectrum sunscreens that protect against UVA and UVB raysChoose sunscreen products that are rated 0-2in the Environmental Working Groups Sunscreen Guide.When it comes to being in the sun, Im lucky. I tan, dont burn and dont completely freak out if I forgot my sunblock  however, because of my olive complexion I have to stay in the sun longer in order to get sufficient Vitamin D. (The lighter your skin color, the faster your absorption of Vitamin D). I wear sunblock at the pool, at the beach and when Im outdoors for extended periods, but Ive decided not to wear it everyday.Using as little as 15 SPF blocks your bodys ability to convert the suns rays to Vitamin D by 99%. If you want to increase your chances of avoiding diseases linked to deficiencies in Vitamin D (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and depression)  you must get sunshine! The suns rays are pure wonderful energy your body needs.Before I go  I want to mention this important fact. The biggest immediate benefit of getting sun a few times a week is the reduction of cravings. When Vitamin D levels are low, the hormone that controls appetite stops working. You eat and eat and eat, and never feel full when this happens. The sun contributes significantly to the daily production of Vitamin D, and as little as 10 minutes of exposure a few times a week is enough to help prevent deficiencies. Vitamin D also helps boost serotonin levels, your happy hormone, warding off depression which naturally reduces cravings. For me, this is reason enough to let the sun shine in!If you know someone that might still be buying sunscreen with shady ingredients, please share this post with them, you could have a serious impact on their livelihood!Thank you for spreading the word to the ones you love.Food BabeP.S.

42,Our Response to Kraft’s Letter: It’s Time To Surrender Your Artificial Dyes,http://foodbabe.com/2013/03/14/our-response-to-krafts-letter-its-time-to-surrender-your-artificial-dyes/,"Its been a little over one week since we started apetition to remove artificial food dyesfrom Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. We have over228,000 signaturesand, while we heard from Kraft right after the petition launched, it was not the response we were hoping for.We thought it would be important to share their response and exact letter with you, so you can understand exactly what we are up against.Below youll see Krafts letter to us along with our specific response and reaction inbold.From Kraft:Thanks for contacting us. The safety and quality of our products is our highest priority and we take consumer concerns very seriously. We carefully follow the laws and regulations in the countries where our products are sold. So in the U.S., we only use colors that are approved and deemed safe for food use by the Food and Drug Administration.Our Response: When Kraft found out the safety of artificial food dyes was in question in Europe  why didnt they make the safety of U.S. citizens their highest priority, too? Food is food  whether in our country or someone elses  why not make all Kraft products standardized to the highest safety regulation across the board? Kraft was able to reformulate their products without artificial dyes in the U.K. without noticeably changing the color or taste  we even taste tested it ourselves just to prove this point. We know it can be done; Kraft doesnt have to reinvent the wheel.To further prove this point  Kraft stated this fact themselves by reformulating Lunchables in the UK without compromising quality, taste and food safety.Kraft Foods UK has no products aimed at children that contain the ingredients highlighted in the FSA [Southampton] study. . . . [W]ith our recent Lunchables reformulation in the UK, we reduced fat and salt, as well as removed artificial colours and flavours. Without compromising quality, taste and food safety, we will continue to see where we can make changes and still meet consumer expectations.Kraft Foods UK (Quote Taken fromAllergyKidsFoundation)Because Kraft has not willingly and proactively reformulated their products in the US, its obvious to us that Krafts highest priority is their bottom line. We are asking Kraft, a multi-billion dollar company, to be the leader in the US Food Industry by voluntarily removing artificial dyes and owning up to the statements they make about safety and quality of their products.From Kraft:We expanded our line of KRAFT Mac & Cheese (KMC) offerings. We know some people prefer foods without certain ingredients  we now offer a multitude of products without added colors, as well as products with natural food colors including:KMC Organic White CheddarKMC Organic CheddarKMC White CheddarKMC AlfredoKMC Deluxe Original CheddarKMC Deluxe Four CheeseKMC Deluxe Sharp CheddarKMC Homestyle Creamy Parmesan AlfredoKMC Homestyle Sharp Cheddar and BaconKMC Homestyle Classic CheddarKMC Homestyle Hearty Four CheeseKMC Homestyle Bowl Southwest TortillaKMC Homestyle Bowl Creamy Broccoli with White CheddarKMC Cup AlfredoOur Response: Who prefers food with artificial color? We are not sure many consumers do since it adds no benefit or nutritional value to the foods its in and is simply a cheap, cosmetic additive. And what about all the kids that reach for the boxes with cartoon characters? Do you really think they are going to pick out the Organic/Homestyle version over Spongebob? The above options of Macaroni and Cheese without artificial dyes are not targeted towardschildren, and the versions that are specifically designed for children do contain Yellow #5 and Yellow #6. Children are the ones that are most at risk for complications when consuming artificial dyes. In Europe, a food company is required to use a warning label when using artificial food dyes stating, May cause adverse effects in activity and attention in children on the package.But meanwhile back in the US, Kraft features children regularly in commercials and goes as far as holding essay contests specifically for children to promote the introduction and creation of new product lines containing artificial food dyes  products like Cheddar Explosion, Extreme Cheese Explosion, and Grilled Cheese Explosion.Since artificial dyes provide no value but do pose risks, we believe it is up to Kraft to voluntarily change their product and stop exploiting the FDA laws to their financial advantage. The 30 or so Kraft varieties that do still contain artificial dyes in the US are unfair to the children lured by these products, unfair to the less fortunate who buy these products because they are cheaper, and unfair to the uneducated consumer that is unaware of these potentially harmful ingredients.Even the FDA admits we should be concerned, stating the following on theirwebsite:Exposure to food and food components, including AFC [Artificial Food Colors] and preservatives, may be associated with behavioral changes, not necessarily related to hyperactivity, in certain susceptible children with ADHD and other problem behaviors, and possibly in susceptible children from the general population.Yellow #5 and #6 both have not been retested since their approval  do we have confidence in the FDA to keep up to date on health risks considering there were91 artificial dyes(allowed in food, drugs, cosmetics, or medical devices) that were at one point approved by the FDA that are now no longer authorized or have been restricted?Also what about all the big restaurant chains like Applebees, IHOP, Perkins, Dennys, Longhorn Steakhouse, Bob Evans and Steak n Shake offering Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in kids meals and on menus across the country? These children do not get a choice between mac & cheese with or without dyes  instead they are solely offered the riskier option.From Kraft:We appreciate the opportunity to share this information with you.Our Response: Sharing this information with us does not address our petition nor does it address our concerns for the health of Americans. We request that Kraft listen to the (228,000+) people signing our petition and the families who have reached out to us directly in concern.Weve received numerous letters from parents and people who have had dramatic improvements in the health of their families after removing artificial dyes. Here are just a few excerpts from these hundreds of letters  we hope this finally convinces Kraft to act and remove artificial dyes:Artificial dyes caused him to have tantrums that nobody could believe  after eating anything containing dye  absolutely any and everything could set him off into a tantrum and he would scream in such a state of rage that he was unreachable for approx. 50-60 minutes at a time. TracyMy son had very bad eczema along with hyper activity when he was younger. After years of expensive medicine and creams for his skin we decided to stop eating foods with dyes in them.The results were astounding. I had a much more manageable child with beautiful skin.  ReneeMy 5 year old son, has horrible reactions to artificial dyes. Weve always been very cautious about what we eat, we dont buy products that contain artificial ANYTHING, but we used to let him partake in treats at parties that contain artificial colorings, until we realized the random violent outbursts he was having came only after consuming artificial dyes. Normally, he is a very sweet soul, but the day after Halloween, when we had allowed him to eat skittles, he had a violent outburst in class where he threw a chair. A CHAIR. His teachers were shocked, so were we.  EmilyWe struggled for over 2 years, trying various strategies to stop the tantrums, teach him to self-soothe and calm himself when overstimulated, and help him sleep through the night again. Nothing worked until we eliminated artificial food dyes from his diet when he was 4 1/2 years old. We saw dramatic results just 5 days after eliminating them. He started sleeping through the night consistently for the first time since he was a baby, and his intense and long-lasting tantrums also disappeared.  JenniferMy 5 old daughter is hypersensitive to food dyes which we didnt discover until we took them away. Her behavior was off the charts fighting, screaming, and just plain unhappy. We removed artificial food from her diet, she became a different child. She is happy and compliant. But if she has any thing containing food dye, she losses her mind and will begin to scream, fight, hit the halls. Finally at the age of 5 she is able to tell me when she has a headache and its alway after having something containing artificial food dye at school. This cant be just a coincidence!! I mean every time my daughter has artificial food dye she is in pain!  KelliMy 14 year old daughter was diagnosed with eczema when she was 3 months old. We have been to many Doctors and have had way to many prescriptions. The triggers for this condition are many. The major ones that we have found that bother her are artificial dyes.As you can imagine, it is very difficult to keep all of them out of our homes. It is something that we need to be mindful of everyday if she wants to stay healthy.I truly believe that all dyes should be banned for our food supply today. Not only our food supply but also from medications, whether over-the-counter or prescription.  KerryOne of my sons is allergic to artificial food dyeto the point of it being life-threatening. His breathing becomes labored, he becomes lethargic and we must have (dye-free) Benadryl and an EPI Pen Jr. on hand at all times. Fortunately, we try to eat very naturally so we were able to identify the issue fairly quickly. However, its very difficult to protect him from artificial food dye in public, i.e. visiting friends/family, church, schools, etc. It would be a relief to this momma if artificial food dye were out of U.S. food products.   JenMy son has Aspergers, a form of autism. Food dyes significantly affect his behavior sometimes leading to explosive tantrums. Red dye #40 causes aggression and self injury. Blue #2 and yellow #5 affect his communication and emotional state. Basically, he becomes nasty and grumpy. Unable to tell us how he is really feeling, this behavior leads to tantrums. Food dye is not allowed in my house. Why do I care if other children eat it? Because until people are fully educated on the side effects of the poison they feed their children they are not able to make rational choices.  MicheleMy son is adversely affected by artificial colors. Several months ago we removed all foods with artificial colors and flavorings from his diet to see if his behavior would improve. We were amazed to find that by removing these from his diet he has a better attention span and is less fidgety. If there is ever a time when he does eat something with these dyes in it, after about 20 minutes I can tell.  ChristieMy 2 year old daughter breaks out in hives from artificial food dyes.  KatieWe were having a hard time with his behavioral outbursts when I read an article on how food dyes can often effect kids with ADHD. I decided for the heck of it to remove them from our home. We already eat pretty healthy, but Mac and Cheese was one thing that my son loved and was willing to eat. I switched to the organic brand Annies and also now read every thing I buy. If it contains and food coloring at all, we dont buy it. Within a month my son completely changed. His erratic behavior was gone and he was able to focus a lot more on tasks. His stimming (self stimulating behaviors that you see with Autism) also decreased significantly.   LoriWe hope you join us and demand this change by signing this petition nowand sharing it with as many people as you know. Together we can make our voices heard!With Much Love,Vani1657@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

43,Coca Cola’s Low Calorie Beverages Will Kill You Before They Solve Obesity,http://foodbabe.com/2013/01/25/coca-colas-low-calorie-beverages-will-kill-you-before-they-solve-obesity/,"When I saw Coca-Colas new anti-obesity ad, my jaw dropped wide open. Yes, you read that right Coca-Cola is on a new mission to fight the obesity epidemic now, in what I call a desperate attempt to prevent declining sales. The sad part is that some people will actually believe their nonsense. In the advertisement they try to make a case that there is room for Coca-Cola products in peoples healthy diets.Coca-Cola is promoting the introduction of new low calorie beverages and using the failed logic of a calorie is a calorie to convince people who need to lose weight to keep Coca-Cola products around in their diet.But you know what? A calorie isnt a calorie  when its made up of chemicals that affect how much you eat and the way your body metabolizes those chemicals.So Im here to break that down for you and detail out why Coca-Colas low calorie beverages will not fight obesity  and if anything  the reliance on low calorie chemical-filled drinks just perpetuates the problem even more. Proving in fact, that these drinks will continue to be linked to the increase in obesity.If you want to see the full advertisement videoit is at the bottom of this postbut I dont recommend watching it (unless you want to get a good laugh) because it deserves no more attention and I want you to focus on the truth that I am about to share with you now.(And when you see this advertisement being played during the Super Bowl coming up  I suggest you yell loudly at the TV, like I plan on doing.)Quotes from Coca-Colas Anti Obesity Advertisement:For over 125 years, we have been bringing people togetherReally?? How? By selling a products to adults and children that are linked to diabetes, heart disease and obesity? Hmmm. What do you call spending millions of dollars against the consumers right to know  i.e. GMO labeling  Is this bringing people together? If anything  it makes you an enemy company people should boycott.Weve created smaller portion control sizes for our most popular drinks and well have then in about 90% of the country by the end of this yearA smaller can of poison will not solve obesity. Thank you.No matter where they come from, including Coca-Cola and everything else with calories.And if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, youll gain weight This is faulty logic and Ill show you why in just a minuteAcross our portfolio of more than 650 beverages we now offer over 180 low and no calorie choices and most of our full calorie beverages now have low or no calorie versions.Over the last 15 years, this has helped reduce the average calories per serving across our industries products in the US by about 22% This is where I want to take a closer look at exactly which low calorie beverages Coca-Cola is referring to here are some examples and the ingredients these low calorie beverages include:Artificial Sugars  Linked to Obesity and aMyriadof DiseasesSure you can save some calories drinking beverages with artificial sugars, but you wont reduce your risk of obesity or getting a tumor.If someone is trying to lose weight, the consumption of artificial sweeteners is not the solution and will not work as long term strategy. Artificial Sweeteners are proven to stimulate your appetite, increase carbohydrate cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain.Thats right  consuming artificial sweeteners actually increases your appetite. Think about it  when someone consumes something that is sweet, but it has little to no calories  their brain receives a signal to want more calories because their body is not actually getting any energy (i.e. enough calories) to get satisfied. So that person keeps looking for gratification elsewhere and ends up craving more.The fact that Coca-Cola and other food industry giants are getting away with this orchestrated deception is unbelievable and then to say developing low calorie beverages using these artificial sweeteners is actually going to help the obesity epidemic? Seriously? Who are they kidding?Furthermore, there are more dangerous side effects from artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame, which is considered one the most dangerous substances allowed in our food supply. Aspartame is found in Powerade, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Dr. Pepper, Fanta Light, Fuze, Minute Maid Light, etc.Over 10,000 complaints have been filed with the FDA on this substance since 1980 and has actually never been proven to be safe before it was approved for use in our food supply. Aspartame is linked to diabetes, auto-immune disorders, depression (which can cause you to eat more  once again), birth defects, and several forms of cancer.Erythritol found in Vitamin Water Zero is a sugar alcohol the body does not easily digest and is linked to diarrhea, headache and other intestinal disorders.Acesulfame Potassium or acesulfame K is the one of main sweeteners in Minute Maid Fruit Falls  which is a low calorie beverage aimed at kids  and Monster Zero for example. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) it is anything but safe.CSPI reportedthesafety tests of acesulfame-K that were conducted in the 1970s were inadequate. Specifically, two rat studies suggest that the additivemight cause cancer,but these studies were never addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance to also be used unregulated in soft drinks. In addition it is mentioned that large doses of acetoacetamide (a breakdown product of this sugar) have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs. As you might know  the thyroid gland  regulates the endocrine system, which is responsible the metabolism.If Coca-Cola wanted to really improve their offerings  they would immediately eliminate artificial sugars from their products.Natural Flavors  Trick Consumers To Drink MoreBy producing zero or low calorie drinks that taste like the real thing, Coca-Cola is hijacking your taste buds one by one. Food scientists can engineer natural flavors to cause the inability to stop eating or drinking. All of the Coca-Cola products listed above have added natural flavors.These flavors scientists synthesize trick your mind into wanting more and more. They dont want you to have the full essence of the strawberry or real coconut  they want you to only experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste  so you get addicted and keep having to go back for more and more, searching continuously for gratification  eating more of that product which in turns fills Coca-Colas pocket, as well as other big food companies.This is an industry trick that is used in so many products  beyond drinks  but is the most prevalent in low calorie beverages. In a few versions of Coca-Colas product Zico  a coconut water  they have to use natural flavors to cover up the fact that they are getting coconuts from all over the world, that taste different, which they then process into concentrate. Thecoconut water is heated down to syrup and then reconstituted with water.To keep the flavor consistent  they have to add back in natural flavors and what you end up with is an inferior product that is a mix of several different species of coconuts that have lost their original integrity, taste and nutrition.Artificial Colors  Attract Adults and Children to Unhealthy DrinksAdding artificial colors into food, actually contributes to the obesity epidemic by attracting children (and adults) to fake sweetened drinks that provide almost zero nutrition. This is another marketing ploy by Coca-Cola to target more people to get addicted to their products.Additionally  its important to note  the caramel coloring that Coca-Cola and other soda giants like Pepsi use  is completely artificial  not the stuff you make at home by cooking sugar.This caramel color is manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure, which creates carcinogenic compounds. A highdose of this known carcinogen is proven to causeliver tumors, lung tumors, and thyroid tumorsin rats and mice.WhenThe Center for Science in the Public Interestreleased a study last year found dangerous levels of caramel coloring could be contributing tothousands of cancersin the US, it prompted Coca-Cola and Pepsi to quickly change their formulas so they didnt have to include the cancer warning label on their products in California.Regardless of the reformulation  many of Coca-Colas products still contain this caramel coloring  even if its in a lesser amount. How small of a dose of poison are you willing to take on a regular basis?Overconsumption of Caffeine  Causes Addiction and Adrenal FatiqueThe reason why so many of Coca-Colas low calorie drinks contain caffeine  is because they want you to become addicted. The stimulation you get from the caffeine, along with the taste of something sweet  keeps you coming back for more and more. One of the most alarming drinks on the market is Monster Zero which can directly affect how your adrenal glands function and lead to persistent exhaustion. What happens when people are exhausted all the time? They stop moving and likely gain weight.Right now, Monster energy drinks is being sued by multiple families because it is suspected to have caused death of their loved ones. Despite these lawsuits and the recent FDA report about the dangers of energy drinks, Monster continues to be on the market.Genetically Modified Organisms or GMOs  Linked to ObesityEvery single one of Coca-Colas products here are likely to have GMOs. Thats because they have a hidden corn based product  like sorbitol, fructose, aspartame, maltodextrin, or citric acid. And why in the world would they have spent millions fighting GMO-labeling in California, if their products werent full of them!A study published in the International Journal of Biological Sciences shows that GM food is indeed contributing to the obesity epidemic. The study found that GM corn fed to mice led to an increase in overall body weight of about 3.7 percent, while also increasing the weight of the liver by up to 11 percent.The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM), reported studies that show GMOs responsible for faulty insulin regulation and therefore advise their patients to have GMO-free diets.Preservatives  Accelerate Aging and Acidify The BodyPreservatives like sodium benzoate are in almost all of Coca-Colas products. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative mayincrease hyperactivityin children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) benzene can form acarcinogen and kill DNA cells, and accelerate aging.Preservatives cause accelerated aging because they acidify the body. Dr. Jameth Sheridan (D.H.M.) Doctor of Holistic Medicine,states that it takes 36 glasses of water to re-alkaline your body after drinking just one diet soda. 36 glasses! Wow.When your body is in an alkaline state your chances of developing disease is significantly lower than a body in an acidic state. This is because our bodies are made of up of billions of cells that are naturally alkaline according to its ph balance. When we consume more acidic foods (i.e. many of Coca-Colas low calorie drinks) vs. alkaline foods this upsets the balance and leads to all sorts of trouble for our bodies and the organs that regulate our metabolism and weight.Bisphenol A (aka BPA)in Cans  Linked to ObesityAfter reviewing the results of over 3,000 children and teens who had high urine BPA levels and high body mass index, a very recent studydetermined that BPA is linked to childhood obesity.BPA has already been banned in baby bottles  however, kids across the country are still drinking Coca-Cola products tainted with this environmental toxin.Coca-Cola has downright refused to eliminate BPAfrom its products and even defends the use of this metabolism destroying compound on their website.Fructose & Fruit Juice From Concentrate  Too Much Sugar For the Body To ProcessYoull find crystalline fructose in Vitamin Water Zero, which ismade from (genetically modified) corn starch which is 20% sweeter than sugar.Fructose is processed by the body differently than other sugars  and is linked to fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, coronary arterial disease and obesity.Coca-Cola claims that they have helped remove soda from schools by replacing them with juices. (This not entirely true  they actually fought the removal of vending machinesin schools).Nonetheless, these juices are mainly comprised of fruit juice concentrates and do little if anything to solve the problem of obesity.Consuming fruit juice concentrate on a regular basis actually overloads sugar in the liver, which increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.For instance, Minute Maid fruit juice might contain several ounces of straight fructose, with none of the fiber, pulp, or living enzymes that help the body properly digest the sugar.A Cola Cola sponsored smoothie bar using real whole fruit in schools would be a MUCH better solution  just a thought.____________________________________________________In summary, at the end of Coca Cocas advertisement they invite you to.To learn more, and visit coke.com/comingtogether Ha! Thats funny. When pigs fly!Thats the last place anyone should go to learn about solving obesity.If you know a friend or family member who still consumes Coca-Cola products  especially these low or zero calorie beverages  please share this article with them.You could be their hero!Wishing you lots love, health and a longer life than this tortoise.Food Babe140K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

44,Why You Shouldn’t Buy Supermarket Birthday Cakes,http://foodbabe.com/2012/04/06/why-you-shouldnt-buy-supermarket-birthday-cakes/,"My birthday was last week and I had only one thing on my mind. Can you guess what it was?  Nope, it wasnt thoughts about getting older, or what presents I wanted this year or where I wanted to go on my next vacation. All I could think about was Where am I going to get my birthday cake from!?!This is a dilemma for my family and me every single time there is a birthday on the horizon. We sometimes have knock down, drag out fights about where we buy our cakesand thats because not everyone in my family follows the same real food principles as I do. (Im secretly hoping they will read this post so theyll think twice about fighting me next time around!)Growing up we would always get our cake from the local grocery store chain Harris Teeter. This was our go-to cake for as long as I can remember. Then in college and in my early twenties I became a Costco member and was thrilled to be able to get such a huge decadent cake for only $14.99 on my college budget.  As I became more refined in my taste for cake, I thought it would be a good idea to upgrade and shop at the Fresh Market because well it had to be fresher than Harris Teeter or Costco, right? Unfortunately, as youll find out this couldnt be further from the truth.When you look into these three different cakes from three very different places  a regular grocery store vs. a huge wholesaler warehouse store vs. a specialty market  you dont see much difference in the ingredients. They all resemble one big science experimentLets take a look at some of the cakes at Harris Teeter. This cake says Home-style carrot cake but when you you look closely at the ingredients it reveals something much differentWe know why Lisa dislikes artificial colors (that are unfortunately in all the cakes I am sharing with you here today.) But lets talk about a new and scary ingredient you may not have heard of  propylene glycol. This petroleum based chemical food additive  thats been approved by the FDA  is also found in products like brake fluid, acrylic paints, tile grout, primer, shoe polish, antifreeze, floor polish, tire sealant and sealant paste, according to Food Facts.org. It has been reported on Dr. Mercola.com that the following symptoms can arise after repeated small doses  throat irritation, headache, backache, and kidney problems. Furthermore, ingesting very large doses of this chemical can cause drowsiness, vomiting, respiratory failure, coma, convulsions, or can be fatal.Yes  you have to ingest a lot of this stuff to see some of these reactions  but is saying death by a thousand cuts? taking it too far? I dont know  you decide. And why is this stuff in our birthday cakes anyway?Even the cakes that Harris Teeter gets from a famous local bakery, Tizzerts, are just as bad as their store brand cakes because they also contain propylene glycol.Then you move on to Costco where the ingredient list is so long I literally had trouble keeping count  but its close to 80 ingredients! The majority of them are fake chemical fillers and food-like substances that are obviously not real food. (Notice the inflation  the price has gone up $3 dollars since the last time I bought one.)And whats so American about this All American chocolate cake? Gosh I didnt know you needed this many artificial colors (6 to be exact!) to color chocolate  I thought chocolate was already brown!The most upsetting  and most expensive  cakes were from The Fresh Market where I learned they arent made on premises, but instead by a bread and snack manufacturer named Vie de France. Again, this name fools you into thinking you are getting a higher quality or fancier product. I was impressed that The Fresh Market had a book of all the ingredients they willingly shared with me, but when I found the page labeled bakery goods free from trans fat (which had only a very small subset of the large amount of bakery goods in the book) I was deflated to say the least. Again, most of their cakes had propylene glycol too and lots of other preservatives.Regardless of these ingredients being clearly labeled on packaging and readily available, I see these types of cakes at almost every celebration I encounter  baby showers, bridal showers, childrens birthday parties, schools, work celebrations, retirement parties, etc. Childrens birthdays are probably the worst offender especially at school, since the opportunities to celebrate birthdays seem endless.The thought of consuming artificial flavors, artificial colors, transfat, and other food like chemicals made from petroleum willingly on the day we are supposed to be celebrating our life or our childrens lives seems a little ironic, doesnt it?The next time the occasion arises and its time to get a cake, here are 5 questions you need to ask your baker before reaching into your wallet:What ingredients do you use to make your cakes? Always ask this basic question  you may be appalled at what you find. For instance, many cake manufactures use no real sugar at all and the whole cake is made with high fructose corn syrup.What kind of flour do you use? The answer should be an unbleached flour, and if it is organic flour, even better!Do you use any preservatives in your cake? Propolyne glycol, parabens, and polysorbate are just a few of the laundry list of potential preservatives. If there are any of these ingredients or other preservatives used  I would keep looking.Do your cakes contain any partially hydrogenated oils (trans fat)? I would specifically say partially hydrogenated oil because legally food manufactures can still include this ingredient and say no trans fats at the same time.Do you use any artificial colors in your cakes? If you find out the cake is clean, but they still use artificial colors to decorate the cakes, ask for the cake to be made without them and then consider decorating the cake with organic candies, dried fruit, chocolate sauce and/or natural food colorings yourself.You make a decision to vote with your dollars every time you take out your wallet, whether you realize it or not. With the right information and enough conscious decision making about what we eat and how we spend our money, together we can make a change. They say you cant have your cake and eat it too  but why not?P.S.

46,The Unethical Tactics Of The Chemical Industry To Silence The Truth,http://foodbabe.com/2016/10/06/the-unethical-tactics-of-the-chemical-industry-to-silence-the-truth/,"I debated whether or not I should botherto share the information in this post with you. On one hand, I choose to put my focus and energy on the willing  the people who want to hear about whats really in their food and how they can make healthy changes to their lifestyle. On the other hand, there are some serious detractors that do not want the truth about our food to be heard. They are working as agents for the biotechand chemical industry to prevent information about the risks of using GMOs and their productsto come to light.I decided to publish this post because I want you to be awareof who these detractors are  and why they cant be trusted.Myrecent trip to Hawaii is the perfect example of how these detractors workA few months ago, I was invited to speak by Hawaii Center for Food Safety (Hawaii CFS) for an event called the Ethics of Eating. This is the Hawaii chapter of the Center For Food Safety (CFS), a nonprofit organization that promotes organic and sustainable agriculture. They fight back against the corrupt food system with petitions and have bravely taken legal action to force our government to create stronger regulations in regards to GMOs and chemicals that are harming our bodies, the environment,andfarm animals.Hawaii is a hot bed for the research and development of new chemically intensive GMOs and they are a testing ground for many experimental chemicals and crops  it is essentially ground-zero. Five of the largest chemical companies are suing the counties of Hawaii to keep their testing secret. Much of the work that Hawaii CFS is doing is focusing on the public health impacts of the pesticides and herbicides used on GMOs, and because of this, they are heavily targeted by the biotech companies who are profiting off of these chemicals and technologies. In 2015, over 100 Monsanto employees crashed a CFS presentationin Hawaiiin an attempt to intimidate the presenters.This is how biotech operatives operate, and CFSis very aware oftheir tactics. The people that work with CFS are very well respected and fearless activists in an increasingly aggressive climate.I was thrilled I was invited toHawaii to speak, yet I had no idea the absolute chaos that would ensue when they began promoting the event.As soon as my upcoming appearance was announced, the biotech industry quickly engaged and astroturfing began on the Hawaii CFS Facebook page. They began receiving hundreds of insulting and inflammatory comments  mainly criticizing me personally, characterizing me as hilariously uninformed, a crazy food blogger, and telling Hawaii CFS that they promote pseudoscience and fearmongering for bringing me in to speak.Vanis visit to Hawaii would unleash the most powerful display of the pro-GMO public relations machine that I have witnessed since taking my position with CFS. ~ Ashley Lukens, Director of Hawaii Center for Food SafetyThis just goes to show the great lengths that the GMO industry will go to in an attempt to discredit our workand make it difficult for anyone to ever ask me to speak again.They weredefaming me in an attempt to harm my future speaking engagements  but they didntstop there.24 hours before I was scheduledto take the stage, I was informed by Hawaii CFS thatthepro-GMO and satire activist group March Against Myths About Modification (MAMyths) launched a campaign to sabotage the event.The tickets to the event were free, but there were a limited quantity available as the venue could only accommodate a certain number of people. When word spread that I was coming to speak, MAMyths asked their followers to reserve blocks of tickets using fake names and fake emails so that it would appear to be sold out and that we would be speaking to an empty venue.They reserved over 1,500 tickets using names like Fraud Babe, Organic is Dumb, Susi Creamcheese, and Harriett Tubman from traced IP addresses outside of Hawaii and overseas in the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Thailand, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands.They were unsuccessful because Hawaii CFS discovered where these bogus requests were coming from and were able to easily cancel their reservations. Yet, it was clear that we struck a cord and they were trying to disrupt the event.Who is March Against Myths About Modification?MAMyths is a spin-off group and partner of Biology Fortifieda website which advocates strongly for GMOs and who has been working with the PR groupCornell Alliance For Sciencein protesting the bravework being done by U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) whichexposes hidden relationships between biotechcompanies, scientists, and PR firms.Biology Fortified received agrant from the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)  a group sponsored by biotech companies.Theyclaim most of their operational funding comes fromindividual personal donations and that the authors are all unpaid volunteers.MAMyths describesthemselves as Radicals for science utilizing grassroots organization and direct action for social change and are basically satirizing the March Against Monsanto movement. They attend Marches in their I Love GMOs t-shirts and protest talks given by anti-GMO food activists such as Vandana Shiva.Industry front groups like the American Council for Science and Health (funded in part by Bayer and Syngenta) havepromoted MAMyths and encourage people to join them.They have also been featured in the Cornell Alliance for Science newsletter aPR arm of the biotechindustry that defends companies like Monsanto ruthlessly. Why dobiotech and agrichemical companies support MAMyths? Is there more than meets the eye to this relationship?The founders of MAMyths are Karl Haro von Mogel,Kavin Senapathy andDavid SutherlandKarl Haro von Mogel works exhaustively to defend biotechnology (GMOs) and has been called a leader by Cami Ryan, Social Science Lead at Monsanto. Yet, it is unclear how he makeshis living doing this work, as supposedly he is a volunteer for these organizations.Hewas on the faculty for the Biotechnology Literacy Project a boot camp thattrained individuals toengage the media and also to appear as experts in local legislative and government hearings, sponsored by the Monsanto-backed organizationAcademics Review. Karl also writes articles for other pro-Monsanto websites, such as Genetic Literacy Project.Why would Karl show up torecord our recent presentation?Karl showed up at my recent panel discussion with USRTK at the Heirloom Festival on September 8th, 2016 in California and proceeded to film and record our presentation (on 2 devices) even after he was asked to stop recording. Did he travel all the way from his hometown in Wisconsin just to record our discussion? Who paid for him to be there and why?This is not the first time he has tried to harass activists at this event.He did the same in 2014 and offered toreimburse the entrance fee of the event.This begs the question again, who is MAMyth funded by?Kavin Senapathy:Who is she really defending?Kavin likes to call herself a science defender and swings a cartoon sword, but she is not a scientist by trade. Kavin studied Business Marketing atUniversity of Wisconsin. Sheworks as an Advisor forher fathers company, Genome International Corporation, which holds several patents that are likely licensed to biotech companies. She also works as a writer for several pro-GMO blogs like Grounded Parents and Skepchick.She once emailed me for comment on a story she was writing and refused to answer my questions about her conflicts of interest.Just like her friend Kevin Folta, shedenies industry ties but a picture says a thousand wordsIsnt it a bit strange to see her hanging out withMonsantos social media and PR friendsif she has no ties to them?Kavin is a spokeswoman for Chow Babe hate Facebook page.Kavin has taken a big interest in me personally. She spends a verysignificantamount of timecriticizingme and the work of the Food Babe Army.Sheactsas the spokesperson for a Facebook page that was created solely to criticize and parody me all day long, every day, sometimes being severelyoffensive.Kavin co-authored an entire book against the food revolution and meHer social media presencegained the attention of the NPR  The Salt Blog, allowing her to be interviewed and quoted in a heavily circulated hit piece against me. Since focusing on mehad gotten Kavin so much attention, she proceeded to co-author an entire book about me called Fear Babe, which includes a forward written by none other than Kevin Folta  a scientist that was caught red-handed accepting cash from Monsanto for his outreach.Kavin is a busy girl!Spending so much of her time trying to discredit me and our movement. Youve got to ask yourself, what motivates her to do this?More importantly: Whydoes Forbes allowKavin to write articles for them without appropriate conflict of interest disclosure?Kavinhas recently published several articles inForbes (a websitethat reaches millions) in which she spews hate fororganic food and farming, and bashes non-GMO food activists like me over and over again:3 Tactics Donald Trump Shares With Dr. Oz, The Food Babe, And Other Snake Oil Salesmen  Forbes, 10/5/16The Food Babe Is A Bully And Cotton Incorporated Isnt Going To Take It  Forbes, 5/27/16Del Monte Joins Food Babe Army, Shuns Fruit-Saving Technology  Forbes, 4/5/16The Toxic Chemical Hypocrisy Of Food Babe, Joseph Mercola And Mark Hyman  Forbes, 12/3/15In Kavins libelous articles, her sources are PR operatives and peoplewho are paid to protect the profits of the big food and GMO companies.For instance, shecites expertsfrom:U.S. Farmers And Ranchers Alliance (funded byDupont and Monsantoand run by the PR firm Ketchum)Cotton Inc. (a trade group for cotton growers who have received technology from Monsanto)An advisor for the Calorie Control Council (a trade group for artificial sweetener manufacturers that is run by the PR firmKellen Company)Farmer who sells Monsantos GMO seedsAre these people Independent Experts? Absolutely not!In her earlier Forbes pieces, sheco-wrote themwith Henry Miller, a former FDA employee who founded theOffice of Biotechnology, and is also associated with several front groups that ferociously defend the use of GMOs and pesticides. His resume includes accolades from Philip Morris for defending thetobacco industry.Henry has been writingpro-GMO articles for Forbes for over 10 years. Why did Henry takeKavinunder his wing? Did he help her secure a position at Forbes? Does Forbesknow about her relationships to Monsanto and PR firms? Do they know that she heads up a Facebook group that works with front groups? Are her conflicts of interest disclosed? Does Forbesknow shes the leader of a Facebook group encouraging people to use fake names to get fake tickets for an event to harass activists? How can Forbes allow someone to write for them who engages in unethical tacticslike this?Contact Forbes and ask them to disclose Kavins ties to industryIf you think this behavior is as shady as I do, join me in contacting Forbes here and letting them know how you feel about Kavin and her undisclosed ties to the industry.We need to speak up when we see corruptreporting to encourage media outlets to do better due diligence and toinspirereal investigative journalism. I tried to get her to disclose her ties, but my email went unanswered. After my questions about her conflicts of interest went unanswered she continued to write defamatory pro-industry articles about our work without contacting me for comment.Whoelse has beenbehind the wheelat MAMyths?Reportedly, asocial media consultant and contributor for MAMyths is Jayson Merkley, who has a background in writing and marketing. He isa Fellow of the prestigious-sounding group The Cornell Alliance for Science,in which hecompleted their leadership training.Who is the Cornell Alliance For Science, and why do they train leadersto harass food activists?The Cornell Alliance For Science sounds prestigious, right??? In reality, they are arelatively new front group leading the charge in the pro-GMO propaganda machine.They are thepublic relations arm for the agrichemical industryinsidiouslyhosted at one of the most renowned universities in the country.Their goalis to depolarize the GMO debate and their stance is squarely pro-GMO and pro-chemical. The Allianceclaims to have zero industry ties, yet their partners include several organizations funded by biotechnology companies. For instance, one partner is ISAAA, whoreceives funding fromMonsanto and CropLife, a trade organization for biotech.See how they try to obscureaffiliations like these?They want to gag activists into silence and refuse to debate REAL independent scientists.Although their stated mission is to depolarize the GMO debate, when it comes down to it they refuse to debate scientists or activists who are critical of GMOs unless they are in complete control. A GMO debate was organized on the CornellUniversity campus, and no one from Cornell Alliance For Science or Cornell facultywould agree to debate the benefits of GMOs, despite numerous email requests by the student coordinator. They didnt even need to travel! The debate was brought to their campus but they refused.Could it be that they know their arguments are defenseless?They recently got called out by 67 New York State farmers who sent a letter to Cornell, urging them to evict the Alliance for Science for theirbiased and unscientific attitude towards GMOs.Nothing in the materials or programs of The Alliance for Science is anything but entirely pro-biotechnology. They are without balance or significant critical evaluation of the range of agricultural systems and technologies that exist in food production today. ~Elizabeth Henderson, organic farmer from Wayne County, New YorkMeanwhile they are training leaders to exploit the media.The CornellAlliance for Scienceprovidesleadership training to students, farmers, and scientists,many of whom have a background in marketing, business, or journalism, to usetheir communication skills topromote the use of GMOs along with chemical-intrusive agriculture and to slam activists that are fighting for more sustainable practices. They also provide journalism fellowships with cash awards to promote in-depth contextualized reporting. They put on a front that they are activists trying to help farmers, when they are actually just conducting PR work forthe biotech industry.Its disgusting and appalling.There are several scientists, bloggers, farmers and social media personalitiesthat appear to be legitimate, but have strong ties (and sometimes covert financial relations) with thebiotech industry and their PR firms.Usuallytheir relationship to each other runs deep and they take specific steps to hide their affiliations with the industry. Their goal is to fool the masses into believing industry propaganda.The industry has done consumer researchwhich showsthatmost people tend to trust farmers and publicly-fundedscientists for information about GMOs, especially if they are a mom. Armed with this information, theindustry hides their tracks and triesto fool the masses with front groups largely comprised ofuniversity scientists, moms, and farmers.Is this who you trust for information about GMOs?{Above slides presented by the front group Center for Food Integrity at IFT16}The makings of a GMO industry front group and how they hide their affiliations to the industry:1. A biotechor agrochemicalcompany donates money to a foundation or charity that will give the appearance of being independent, but will act as a funnel for their money going forward.2. This foundation will go on to provide funding for a new scientific organization to be established to communicate science to the public. Other times, a PR firm is hired to create this organization. They may even create multiple child organizations down the line to further hide their connections to biotech. These are all front groups. See exampleshere.3. This new front group will create a respectable looking website and social media accounts, stating that their mission is to spread the truth about science and food.4. The front groupwilltrain farmers, bloggers, and scientists (if they are a mom, this is a bonus!) on how to work with them to help spread their messages about the safety of GMOs, food additives, factory farming practices, or pesticides. Sometimes they are paid or given other accommodations to do this work for the organization.5. The organization will call those that they work with andtrainexperts. Theywill recommend them to journalists who are writing for major media publicationsand their ties to the industry are not readily disclosed. They will be touted as independent.6. These trainedfarmersand scientists go out and write for their own blogs and sometimes branch out, writing for bigger publications such as Forbes. Likewise, they create Facebook groups and pages that will be used to poke fun at activists (such as myself) and try to disrupt the work we are doing. There are countless food-related satire and astroturf pages like this online right now.This process has been duplicated dozens of times and will continue as long as they are not exposed!As you can see, these peopleare just agents for biotech. Whether or not they are paid directly by them, they are doing their bidding.I think it is absolutely mandatory forjournalists to investigate and further probe these connections. Judging by the way these groups and individualsmock me publicly andtroll ourwork, it is clear they are working together and havean agenda.The bottomline? We want a safer and healthier food system, and some people want to keep the food system just like it is today  broken, corrupt and full of unregulated food additives and chemicals that only improve the bottom line of food and biotech companies and not our health. We clearly have different missions.I hope that this information gives you more courage to useyour voice online to elicit change. If you do find yourself the victim of their trolling behavior, heres what to do. They want us to stop and be silenced. We truly are creating a safer food system, and they are freaking out!!! That is why they are spewing so much vitriol towards us  they simply have no other options left.Please share this post!The more people aware of these disgusting tactics, the better we are equipped to determine fact from fiction when it comes to finding ultimate health  which is our goal after all.Xo,VaniP.S.

47,Real Life Stories From Inspiring Women Who Eat The Food Babe Way!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/07/27/real-life-stories-inspiring-women-eat-food-babe-way/,"Just to show you how much it can change your life to eat The Food Babe Way, I thought Id share with you some of the incredible emails that Ive received recently. Each of these women have inspiringstories to tell about the transformation they experienced in their bodies and health when they stopped eating processed foods full of additives and filled up their plates with real nutritious food instead! As you read through their stories, Im sure that you will recognize yourself in some of them  I know I do!Kerry: My goal is not to be perfect but to be wise in my food choicesI started my journey at 216, and as of this morning, I am down 9.6 pounds which is great. What I am most proud of is taking control of my health and eating habits. When I ate according to the food guide for two weeks I felt great and had energy and my headaches disappeared. When I slipped back into my drive through habit and ate processed foods I felt bloated and crappy and my headaches returned. There is no doubt in my mind that eating organically as much as possible is beneficial. Sure, it was expensive at first to stock the cabinets and very time consuming to go through my kitchen and throw out the junk. My goal is not to be perfect but to be wise in my food choices and take responsibility for my current condition (which is improving).The best part about changing my health is cooking. I forgot how much I like to cook and using the meal prep guide is fun and keeps me on track while looking ahead. I space my times for eating to every four hours and when I am tempted to eat, I ask myself why? Is it out of habit, boredom, or am I eating to postpone an unpleasant task? If I am really hungry I eat and dont worry about it.Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is one of my very favorite foods, but I no longer eat it (per my agreement) I guess I should say, I no longer consider this my favorite food. I ate a so called healthy burger and was amazed how salty it tasted. My taste buds are changing. I love using new spices such as curry in my chicken and having cucumber in my green drink and putting fresh ginger in hot water for tea.The Food Babe is just what we need. I will become more of a testimony to my family and friends once they see me gain health, vitality, and lose weight. They have heard my diet plans so much they are immune to what I say. They just kind of pat me on the head with a There, there, God bless her, she keeps trying. ~ KerryEllen: My taste buds have changed to crave all the wonderful nutrients I allow themAlthough my mother instilled healthy eating habits (she was beyond her time!) from a young age, I came to America from England 39 years ago and continued (for the most part) with the values instilled in me. Over the years I, like most other Americans, didnt realize the food industry had added all the toxins and chemicals into our foods until a few years ago when I was shocked at my weight gain and decided to go back to the principals I had been taught. During this time I came across The Food Babe (amongst others) and started to follow her teachings becoming aware of all the dreadful processes in the American food industry today. Armed with this proven new method of approaching food, I was living, breathing testament to the way we eat and wanted to share this with everyone I came in contact with, especially those near and dear to me.Other than being an example of good health and the foods I allow in my temple and gifting The Food Babe Way to many of those I love, unfortunately this has not been received as I would like and have come to realize that if anyone is interested in doing something good for themselves, I am there to help and advise but not to force it on anyone, however much I love them.I love how I feel, huge amounts of energy (walking average of 7-10 miles per day), dropped 40 lbs and of course the way my taste buds have changed to crave all the wonderful nutrients I allow them. Some days its a challenge to stay the course without seeming either rude or smug but I have been doing this long enough now that it is getting easier and easier especially eliminating most grains and unnecessary carbs. I am blessed in that I dont have to deal with any health issues but I believe this would not be the case without the changes in my diet.I have shared all of The Food Babes eating guides and books with many friends and family members and mostly show by example as I realize not everyone is going to be receptive to this. Everyone is on a different course in their lives and if I can help by sowing seeds, with The Food Babes help, that is the best I can do. ~ EllenCharla: My blood tests had improved unbelievably. My cholesterol went from 215 to 145 and Im NOT on any cholesterol medicationIve been T2 Diabetic for almost 10 years now caused by large doses of Prednisone. When I was finally able to afford healthcare and stop going to Mexico to buy medicine I got back to my doctor to have regular blood tests. I was staying in Texas for the holidays and there was just TOO MUCH TEMPTATION all over the house. I couldnt say no. In January, I got back to my doctor and he looked at my blood tests and couldnt believe how bad they were. He said, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT YOU EAT! He even asked if I drink, which I dont, because of the decline in my liver. I was raised with all vegetables having a white or cheese sauce, potato chips, cokes & canned fruit.On the drive back to Texas I heard Vani on health radio. She just clicked in my head. I got to Tucson, found a book store and bought her book. That night I laid in bed all night reading. The next day I found a small health food store and bought organic fruit. I started eating organic lettuce, meats with no antibiotics or preservatives, organic cheeses, no prepared foods, nothing with food coloring (which I was already convinced causes ADHD). I only lost 5-6 pounds because my activity level was still really low due to arthritis and injuries from a car accident but still I was feeling better. In April, I went back to the doctor and my blood tests had improved unbelievably. My cholesterol went from 215 to 145 and Im NOT on any cholesterol medication. I truly believe that following Vani to the best of my ability (and my ability to eat fruits and vegetables is not really good) but I am determined to beat this!!!I am back living in San Diego where people DO eat healthier and cleaner so I have to be honest and say Vani and my community have helped me! But I do believe in Vani and what she stands for. I really havent gone to fast food in years but am so ashamed at all the fast food I gave my kids growing up because our schedule was insane.I love shopping for healthy food and reading the labels. I HAVE to concentrate on my diabetes and get it completely under control. I HAVE to learn to LIKE fresh fruits and vegetables. I do have more energy. I do feel better. Its up to me now to do this completely. Vani has given me the tools. I need to continue using them.There are a lot of haters on the internet and most of them are scientific types. They slam Vani because she doesnt have a degree in science or food technology but I will argue with each and every one of them because I am living proof, emphasis on LIVING, that Vani has her Masters in Common Sense. Thank you Vani. Your book makes great birthday presents!!! ~ CharlaShirley Anne: I am an old lady of 81+ years and walk twice a day every dayThis is a very short story as I am a fairly recent reader of all things Vani sends out through emails. I am an old lady of 81+ years and walk twice a day every day. I have long term osteoarthritis (40 years) and it covers from my neck to my feet & ankles. I must exercise every day for all parts of my body just to keep moving and not in a wheelchair. Move it or lose it.I share any news from Vani with my family and friends. Not everyone is as excited about this info as I am, nevertheless, I share and they can use the info or not. Their decision.My favorite part of changing my health and food habits is the excitement of learning new ways to make old favorites with organic and healthy vegetables. Not much red meat but lots of chicken. I need to up my fish intake  will work on that one. Thanks to Vani I am so much more connected to eating right and reading labels on everything.This winter when the Pennsylvania winters are so long and icy; it is not feasible to walk safely on ice. I took to the internet for all new healthy soups  none of these did I make in the past for my young family  we ate old standbys like vegetable with lots of beef, bean soup with lots of ham  you get the picture. NOW this past winter I have made soups with organic beans, lentils, quinoa, farro and all other ancient grains. I live in an apartment with a neighbor across the hall in her last year of college, so I shared my soups with her and she was a happy young friend. I used a rebounder for winter moving about when the weather was bad. This year in a new locale has been a busy and rewarding one with my turnover in cooking healthy. I credit you with this. Thanks and God bless. ~ S.A.Amelia: Its never too late to improve ones healthIhave read and was told by my doctor years ago, sugar, and salt are killers as well as processed foods. I am 84 yrs old and ate healthy (my moms cooking) over the years. I fell into sweets and fast foodswhen I was working, now knowing all the info regarding chemicals, etc, I have cut back on sugar about 90%, no salt and no processed foods.Some people asked why am I depriving myself of foods I love, at my age. With my heart and stroke issues I do not want to die hooked up to machines in hospital, its never too late to improve ones health so Iam trying to eat more veggies, fruit, hardly any red meat, little poultry, no seafood (deathly allergic).I omitted processed foods and I am now beginning to regain my energy. I have health issues that keep me from doing too much but all in all between giving up sweets, eating lots more veggies then before, and fruit, I know I am going to be fine, by the Grace of God. I am still driving, very little running around and miss dancing. I really feel keeping away from the chemicals in foods is the reason I am doing this well.

48,See What Happens When Twins Makeover Their Diet The Food Babe Way! {Lisa & Laurie’s Story},http://foodbabe.com/2016/04/19/two-twins-makeover-their-diet/,"This week has been a bit surreal to me. Im celebrating the 5 year anniversary of FoodBabe.com (yeah!) and reflecting on all that has happened since I first started this blog. Never in my wildest dreams did I envision all that the Food Babe Army has come to be! Changing multi-billion dollar corporations for the better, educating families across the world about whats in their foodand changing so many individual lives. To say I have my dream job, would be an understatement  theres nothing more in the world I would rather do.The most rewarding part of it all is YOU. When you send me an emailand tell me that one of our campaigns has raised your awareness about a crazy food additive in our food supply that you now avoid or that you have been following the 21 habits in my New York Times Best Selling bookThe Food Babe Way and feel and look so much better or that you are loving the recipes and tips in myEating Guides it totally makes my day and lets me know that what Im doing is making a real life-changing difference.That being said, I have a super inspiring story from a reader (actually two readers!) to share with you today! I know we all could use a little bit of motivation and I love reading real life stories of people who have succeeded at changingto a healthier diet and lifestyle  and are reaping the benefits! Dont you?Im going to start sharing more stories like these with you all, so get ready!Last SummerI started communicating with Lisa, who reached out and told methat she was doing something very exciting. Lisa, a 39 year old identical twin, decided to do a Food Babe Way challenge with her sister Laurie for the next 6 months.Lisa was already a dedicated Food Babe reader and would be following Food Babe eating habits, while her sister was a bit resistant to change and intended to continue with her typical lifestyle.I provided Lisa with a Food Babe Eating Guide Program Membership to help give her all of the tools that she would need to be successful and she really has been! Im so floored and inspired by what a difference they both have made and Im sure that once you hear their stories you will feel inspired too!Meet Lisa & Laurie:Lisas story:My name is Lisa, and I live in Ballantyne, NC. I am 40 years old, a wife, and mother of 3. I work full-time as a nanny of 2 children, and also attend college. I am pursuing a career in Nursing.Last year I noticed my body was changing  my normal routine of being active only occasionally, and not paying attention to the foods I was eating on a daily basis was beginning to show. Six months before my 40th birthday I decided it was time to make a change!I came across the blog written by Lisa Leake, from 100 Days of Real Food.I was so impressed with the meals, especially the lunch ideas for my kids, I took the pledge and my journey to eating healthy began. I became acquainted with Vani Hari on the blog, began researching, and discovered foodbabe.com  this took my eating habits to an entirely new level. The research Vani does and the impact she has on so many lives immediately drew me in and furthered my commitment to living an entirely healthy and new way of life..the foodbabe way!Not only have I seen improvements in my body, skin, and hair, but I feel happy! I used to feel emotional a lot, stressed out, tired, and just unhappy with everything around me. I can only express that I feel peaceful, completely less stressed, even with the added activities and more of a busy schedule than I had before. I find time to work out consistently, cook for my family, and have an overall happier family as a result.The most important thing I have learned is to read my labels. I am now aware of the harmful chemicals in our food and products we use. Also I have learned the difference between GMO and NON-GMO, organic and non-organic. My main goal is to just eat food that is living and will take care of my body.My sister Laurie and I challenged each other to making the biggest improvements we could in the 6 months leading up to our 40th birthday in February. We formed a facebook page to allow others to follow our effort and also to drive some additional accountability. We both saw such great results and had so many friends interested, we decided to continue on to June 1st. We have an amazing group that joined us on our continued journey to a healthy lifestyle  for me its the foodbabe way all the way!~ LisaLauries story:My name is Laurie, I am 40 years old, have been married for 17yrs. and am the proud mama of three. I am a survivor of depression and today I celebrate being medication free for 8 years. Battling depression without medication was the first step I took on my journey to being whole and healthy. I was blessed with good genetics, for the first 26 yrs. I never exercised and I ate whatever I wantedsome could say I was lucky, but I was nave. I had no idea that another battle was just beginning.my battle to become healthy! An obvious first step I had to change my diet. Green leafy foods, well, lets just say they werent a staple in my diet. Fortunately my twin sister Lisa had begun her own journey by following the foodbabe. I am not fond of following rulesI am, quite frankly, a rebellious rule breaker. For months I thought my sister was crazy with all the facts she would send me. I knew I needed to change my diet but it was not until I educated myself on what I was putting into my body that I came to appreciate the value of nutrition. It was then that I joined the foodbabe army! Besides diet I had to exercise, so I started with yoga. I thought yoga would be easy, but quickly found out yoga is not for the weak! At the age of 37 I became a certified yoga instructor. I became strong physically and during the meditation/quiet time my mind was healing too. My desire to look cute in my yoga pants was additional encouragement to eat healthy, but it was a struggle and took years even to incorporate diet and exercise improvements into my daily life. Ive come to realize though, that when you know better you tend to do better. Last November I hit a wall. Though I was now 39 yrs.old and medication free, I was not feeling good about any area of my health. I believed I could do better. Lisa was facing the same wall. We challenged each other to a competition Twin vs. Twin fight to forty. For accountability we posted our challenge on FB and quickly had followers. It worked! Lisa and I celebrated our 40th birthday with great results. We were so encouraged that we decided to do the challenge again and to invite our FB friends to join in. The interest was overwhelming and Lisa and I quickly found that this community of smart, strong women were struggling just like us. Together we celebrate each others accomplishments, share recipes and workouts, but most of all we share our hearts, and I am privileged to travel this journey alongside them. That, the unexpected privilege, was the trophy I received at the end of our challenge. I began on a quest for a six pack, and ended with the blessing of communion. On this journey, I have learned to love myselfin a way I never did before. I feel like I am just getting warmed up, that this is just the beginning. Im pretty excited to meet the Laurie that has yet to be revealed. Looking back I can see a pattern; when I reached a goal I quickly set a new one. These became milestones on my journey thus far, they are permanent marks of great progress on my road to recovery and living a life of wholeness and health. They remind me just how important taking one more step can be.Stay tuned! ~ Laurie (changing the face of the desperate housewife, one workout and meal at a time)Laurie (Left), Lisa (Right)A Healthy Outside Starts From The Inside!I hope Lisa & Lauries story inspires you to know that you can make a change.

49,"When You See What’s In These Popular Fast Food Buns, You’ll Run!",http://foodbabe.com/2016/01/27/when-you-see-whats-in-these-popular-fast-food-buns-youll-run/,"Lets discuss a basic concept about eating real food.Food has to rot! If it doesnt, weve got a huge problem!Real food naturally goes bad  thats what it is supposed to do. So when I see bread that lasts over 10 days, I start to squirm thinking about all the additives it must contain to keep it looking fresh. Bread only hasa fewbasic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt  and then maybe some fat (oil or butter) and sugar. However, the buns at popular fast food restaurants are designed to last much longer than fresh baked buns, sometimes longer than 2 weeks. In order to achieve this long shelf life that improves profitability they have to pump those buns up withartificial, man-made, chemical ingredients.The real question is, what are these chemicals doing to our bodies?How does our health reactwhen we load them up day after day with diets full of GMO soybean oil, azodicarbonamide, calcium peroxide, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color made from ammonia, and other artificial ingredients? Couldthis be the real reason that so many people feel better after they stop eating bread? In this comparison youll see that popular fast food buns are nearly identical and carry many of the same toxic additives!AzodicarbonamideThis is the Yoga Mat dough conditioner that we petitioned Subway to remove from their bread in 2014 (and succeeded!). This additive is banned in Europe and Australia, and The Center For Science In The Public Interest has called on the FDA to ban it in the U.S. as well. The World Health Organization has linked it to respiratory issues, allergies and asthma. When the azodicarbonamide in bread is baked, there is research that links it to tumor development and cancer. According toDr. John Coupland,small amounts of semicarbazide and urethane have been shown to form from azodicarbonamide breakdown during baking and these compounds may pose a health risk.GUILTY BUNS: Burger King, McDonalds (McRib bun), Dairy Queen and Arbys. (Chick-fil-A removed it after our petition to Subway).Monoglycerides and DiglyceridesThis emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing  including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils  which contain artificial trans fat that is detrimental to our health. The consumption of artificial trans fat is strongly correlated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The CDC has linked it to at least 20,000 heart attacks per year and the Institute of Medicine says trans fats have no known health benefit and there is no safe level to eat. GUILTY BUNS: Shake Shack, Dairy Queen, KFC, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box and Arbys.High Fructose Corn Syrup The worst of refined sugars, this sweetener increases appetite, and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. Fast food companies use this man-made sugar because it has a longer shelf life and inhibits microbial spoilage.Almost 50% of high fructose corn syrup samples have been shown to be contaminated with toxic mercury.GUILTY BUNS: KFC, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Dairy Queen and Arbys.Soybean OilAlmost every fast food bun on this list contains this cheap GMO oil that increases the risk of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.GUILTY BUNS: In-N-Out Burger, Dairy Queen, KFC, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Arbys, and Carls Jr.Calcium PeroxideThis bleaching agent and dough conditioner is banned inforeign countries including China (and also from some natural food stores like Whole Foods). Its use is a sign that the bun is heavily processed and not something I want to put in my body. Its also not a necessary ingredient. McDonalds doesnt use calcium peroxidein their buns in the U.K.so why do they use it here?GUILTY BUNS: Chick-Fil-A, McDonalds, Dairy Queen, Jack In The Box, and Arbys.Sucralose This artificial sweetener (a.k.a Splenda) is added to KFCs buns even though they already add high fructose corn syrup. Research out of Europe showed rats developed leukemia after consuming sucralose.GUILTY BUNS: KFC.Caramel ColorThere are 4 different types of caramel color used by the food industry.Class III and Class IV caramel color (commonly used in bread)aremade from ammonia and contain the byproduct 4-MEI, a known cancer risk. We contacted Arbys and asked them what class of caramel color they use and have not heard back from them yet,butwill updatehereas needed.Natural orArtificial FlavorsAny time you see flavors on an ingredient list be aware that you dont really know what you are eating. According to the Environmental Working Group, every flavor has their own secret list of up to 100 ingredients, includingsynthetic chemicals such as the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA as well as GMO-derived ingredients. Flavorscan also include excitotoxins like MSG that cause your taste buds to experience irresistibility when it comes to food.GUILTY BUNS: Carls Jr., Dairy Queen, KFC, Wendys, and Arbys.Acesulfame Potassium According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) this artificial sweetener is anything but safe. CSPI reported the safety tests of acesulfame-K that were conducted in the 1970s were inadequate. Specifically, two rat studies suggest that the additive might cause cancer, but these studies were never properly addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance.GUILTY BUNS: Carls Jr.Neotame This is a relatively new and rarely used artificial sweetener that can be found in Carls Jr.s buns. Some health experts warn that this chemical sweetener is more harmful to our health than aspartame  a neurotoxin  but its safety is still up in the air. Just like experts believedthat Sucralose was safe when it first came out, people trusted what they were told and consumed it for years before it was linked to leukemia. I dont know about you, but I dont see any reason to consume a risky chemical invention that is unnecessarily added to food, especially since it has zero health benefits!GUILTY BUNS: Carls Jr.DATEMThis acronym stands for Diacetyl Tartaric Acid Esters of Monoglycerides, and isa dough conditioner that is usually derived from soybean or canola oil (GMO crops). Just like mono and diglycerides, this ingredient can be a hidden form of deadly trans fat in our food that most people dont know about.GUILTY BUNS:Shake Shack, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Arbys, and Carls Jr.Calcium PropionateThis mold-inhibitor was found in almost every fast food bun on our list  even at In-N-Out Burger!Calcium Propionate is considered a safer preservative, but beware that research published in the Journal of Paediatric Child Health links it to irritability, restlessness, inattention and sleep disturbance in some children and long term consumption of calcium propionate has also been shown to damage the stomach lining and induce ulcers.GUILTY BUNS:In-N-Out Burger, KFC, Dairy Queen, Burger King, Chick-Fil-A, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Arbys, and Shake Shack.All that  and I barely even mentioned the GMOsYoull almost always find at least one of these ingredients derived fromGMO crops in a fast food bun:Corn SyrupHigh Fructose Corn SyrupSugar (from sugar beets)Cottonseed OilSoybean OilCanola OilMaltodextrinDextroseDATEMMono and DiglyceridesGMOs are concerning because theycancontain glyphosate residues from the Roundup weed killer that is prevalently used on them. Glyphosate was deemed aprobable carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is also linked tokidney disease,birth defects, andautism.Thankfully, I cant remember the last time I ate a burger from one of these fast food places, but Id go back in time and knock it out of my hands now if I could!If you or any of your loved ones are still hitting up the fast food drive thru, please share this post with them!Xo,Vani22.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

50,Dissecting Thin Mints Girl Scout Cookies {It Isn’t Pretty!},http://foodbabe.com/2016/01/19/dissecting-thin-mint-girl-scout-cookies-isnt-pretty/,"There is no denying that Girl Scout Cookies are delicious but when you find out whats actually in them, you might think twice about eating them ever again. I used to be a Girl Scout and if I knew what I know now about food and nutrition, I would have boycotted selling them until the ingredients changed.We all know cookies are cookies and they are a treat that isnt meant to be healthy. But, thecookies I like to eat have basic ingredients  flour, sugar, butter or coconut oil, baking soda and eggs. If youve been to any grocery store lately, youll see that there are tons of options that are just that. So, whyis it that the Girl Scouts getlittle girls to hawk these cookies year after year that are filled with artificial and questionable ingredients?Just take a look at the ingredients, they speak for themselves!Sugar made from GMO Sugar BeetsThe sugar in Girl Scout Cookies doesnt allcome from sugar cane, but instead from genetically modified sugar beets. This type of sugar cancontain glyphosate residues from the Roundup weed killer that is prevalently used on them. Glyphosate was deemed a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is also linked to kidney disease, birth defects, and autism. If you think a little bit of herbicide residue in your cookie isnt something to worry about, consider this, soon after Monsanto got approval to market GMO sugar beets for public consumption, they requested that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increase the limit of allowable glyphosate residues in sugar beet roots from 0.2 ppm to 10 ppm  thats a 5000% increase! Given the prevalence of Roundup-Ready crops in America, just how much of this stuff are we really eating? Not to mention glyphosate pollution of our water, soil and air that is affecting us all. High Fructose Corn SyrupThere are two versions of of Girl Scout Cookies made by 2 different bakers. Although the ingredients are nearly identical, one version of the Thin Mints cookie (and some other cookie varieties) is sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup. This sweetener can be contaminated with toxic mercury and has been shown to contribute to type II diabetes, especially in children.Partially Hydrogenated OilsThe Girl Scouts use a sneaky FDA loophole to claim all of their cookies contain 0 Grams Trans Fat per serving, while some of them (including Thin Mints made by Little Brownie Bakers) actually contain partially hydrogenated oil withartificial trans fat. They get away with this because the FDA allows any product is labeled 0 grams of Trans Fat to contain up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving(which is only 4 Thin Mints). Yet, the Institute of Medicine says that no amount of trans fat safe to eat becausetrans fat islinked to thousands of cases of heart disease. Please note  The FDA is requiring all food manufactures to remove trans fats by 2018, but food companies can still petition the FDA for a special permit to continue using it.Enriched White FlourThis type of flour has been stripped of natural nutrients so it has no redeeming qualities and is essentially dead food. So, they enrich it with synthetic vitamins (niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid) that are not naturally derived. These fake nutrients are engineered in a lab from such things as coal tar, ammonia, formaldehyde, GMO bacteria, and petroleum.Artificial Flavors The type of flavors used by the Girl Scouts is a top secret man-made concoction of chemicals. Not only do you not know what chemicals you are really eating when you eat artificial flavors, but they are linked to allergic reactions. Class IV Caramel ColorThere are 4 different types of caramel color used by the food industry, and Class IV caramel color is added to some Girl Scout cookies like Thin Mints. Class IV caramel color is made from ammonia and contains the byproduct 4-MEI, a known cancer risk.And if Thin Mints are not your favorite Girl Scout Cookie, Samoas are even worse!And if you like Tagalongs  heres the deal with those:Do we really need to buy these cookies to support the Girl Scouts?When the Girl Scouts come knocking, consider a donation or volunteering for the Girl Scouts instead of buying these cookies. Please also consider signing this petition started by a little Girl Scout asking for organic and non-GMO cookies!Voting with your dollars is not always popular or easy but surely sends the right message to these bakers that continue to use these controversial ingredients.If you know someone who is selling or eating Girl Scout Cookies, please share this post with them. The more people that know the truth, the better!Xo,Vani52.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

51,“I felt hopelessly addicted to food…” but not anymore!,http://foodbabe.com/2015/09/15/addicted-to-food/,"How do we decide what to eat when we live in a world full of toxic food? All it takes is a little planning and action.Many of you are upset about whats happening in the food industry and I dont blame you.Upon reading my investigations and finding out the truth, you say:Tell me what I can eat!Thats my favorite brand  oh no!I was addicted to that!?I just fed that <insert product> to my child this morning  what am I suppose to do now?Well, I have a solution and I want to make sure you know about it!The only person who can control your health is you. I didnt understand this growing up. Instead, I believed what everyone else around me was telling me. I looked up to several authoritative figures, organizations and companies and blindly followed them as many people do today.The food industry and organizations like Weight Watchers told me I could eat anything I wanted as long as I checked the calories or points and fat grams. I followed their advice and found myself always in a struggle to maintain my weight. The advice left me with no energy and feeling hungry all the time.I outsourced my meals to restaurants like Subway that told me I would eat fresh and lose weight like Jared if I ordered their sandwiches. I believed them and so many other restaurant chains that were serving me industrial chemicals instead of real food.For so long, I looked to everyone else for answers. I didnt know that everything I believed for most of my life would be turned upside down once I started to investigate this for myself.My biggest lesson learned during all of this discovery has been:I cannot outsource my health or my food.As a result, I started to learn how to cook and how to prepare my own food as much as possible  and this is how The Food Babe Eating Guide Membership was born.Over the last few years I have learned that this lifestyle is not for everyone. Not everyone is ready to take back control of their food and stop outsourcing it to corporations. Some refuse to believe whats really happening to our food supply and thats ok. But, what inspires me most is the people courageous enough to take back control and serve as the change we all wish to be in the world! Jennifer is a perfect example of that.Jennifer has been aFood Babe Eating Guidemember for over a year now. When I learned about her amazing transformation, I asked her if it would be ok for me to share her story and letter with you. I love all that she has accomplished and she is the perfect example of what can happen when you take back control of your food. Obviously, I cant guarantee these results for you withthis program, but this really embodies what can happen if you make a commitment to yourself and stop making excuses. Not only has she clearly lost weight (66 pounds!), but she now glows from the inside out and has changed her familys life forever.Heres what Jennifer has to say:I am so excited to have the opportunity to share my story with you and to thank you for all the hard work that you have done to help encourage me and many others.Let me start by giving you a bit of my history. I have struggled with my weight in my thoughts and self image or actually being overweight most of my life. I have never liked vegetables. My diet mostly consisted of fast food hamburgers, chicken nuggets, fries, and pizza. When I would eat at home it would be boxed foods or some other version of fried and processed foods. I drank sodas and juices and very little water. I have always been an athletic energetic type of person. I was a cheerleader and a gymnast and so I managed my weight pretty well. I can say that looking back but when I was looking in the mirror at that age I always felt fat.When I went on to college my activities became a lot more sedentary and the weight began to stick. I gained 20 pounds in the first six months. Fast forward through the next seventeen years and I was obese. I was one hundred pounds over weight and pre diabetic. I had abnormally high white blood cell count, plantar fasciitis, and heals spurs. My white blood cell count was so high and abnormal that they thought I might have leukemia. Upon lots of testing and emotionally fears, I found out that my white blood cell count had been high going back as much as 15 years. I could hardly walk because of the pain in my feet. I also had a nursing rash that I got immediately upon the birth of my fourth child. It lasted for two years. I could not get rid of it.After two years I went to a dermatologist who said it was staff infection and I would need to take an antibiotic for two months. I had tried every diet. I had lost fifty pounds here and there and then gained it back. It was a cycle.I felt hopelessly addicted to food. I felt trapped in the cycle. I was always worried about the longevity of my life for the sake of my children as well as my own.Then in September of 2013 my dad was diagnosed with cancer. My dad developed diabetes at age 36, but he seemed to totally manage that disease. However, when he got cancer I was immediately faced with my fears. My dad is in construction, which requires a lot of physical activity and he has never been as overweight as me. So as I looked at him I saw myself but worse. It was like the hand of God empowered me to change in that very moment. And that is exactly what happened to me. My life changed.I started learning about food. I had several friends who were on this journey as well. One friend, Hillary, helped me so much. It was very important part of this journey to have encouragement and accountability. Then one day my mom, Debbie, told me about FoodBabe. I was so excited and amazed by the information that she was giving. She was making such an impact in the world. She was making a difference.I signed up for her monthly menus. I was so excited to have the meal plans and the shopping lists. She is very creative. One of the things that I like most about FoodBabe is that she is very realistic and neutral. In this journey it has been hard to find the heathly road. There are so many healthy plans . Yet FoodBabe is very practical and teaches you how to have spice in life without the chemicals. The food is tasty and enjoyable. It is beautiful to the eyes as well as tasting great.I have really enjoyed many of her videos of how to make things, like coconut milk. I used to buy the So Delicious thinking that was the best choice. But once again FoodBabe showed me how easily I can make my own. I have read her book as well. And it is awesome. It is captivating and encouraging. FoodBabe is spunky and stunning. She is bold and courageous. She is educated and full of wisdom. Her guidance in this journey as been invaluable. She has an amazing ability to reach in to peoples lives and change them. She is reaching into the culture and changing it. She is reaching into the world of big food and changing it. She is arming we the people to make true change in health. She is changing generations to come. She is exposing the truth. She is beyond amazing in this journey of truth. I would encourage anyone to read her articles and get her menu plans.As for me, I have lost sixty six pounds to date. I no longer have plantar fasciitis or heal spurs. My white blood cell count is completely normal. My nursing rash went away in the first twenty one days of eating an anti inflammatory diet with no antibiotics. I feel great.I am not at my goal weight yet but I will get there. This is not a sprint. I have learned how to travel and live life all while choosing to eat healthy. My whole family is eating this way. I have peace now knowing that my children will be empowered and educated about food and what is actually in the food. My life is forever changed. Praise the Lord for true and lasting change. September will mark two years of this journey for me. I am still going strong and for the first time have no regrets!Let me encourage each of you to take this amazing journey. You will never look back in defeat again. It is beyond worth it. Thank you FoodBabe for all that you do. I will forever be touched by your passion. Your passion is igniting a wild fire that is burning through the world making an impact on everyone!!

52,Subway: We Want Subs Not Drugs! (Share This With Everyone You Know),http://foodbabe.com/subwaymeatshare/,
53,"5 Foods I Used To Eat At The Office That Made Me Sick, Tired and Overweight.",http://foodbabe.com/2015/04/08/5-foods-used-eat-office-made-sick-tired-overweight/,"When I used to work in a busy office, I was exposed to a variety of foods on a daily basis that weresabotaging my health, weight and looks. Because I wanted to fit in and focus on work, I ate whatever everyone else around me was eating, and boy was that a mistake. Thankfully, I broke free from this mentality, started thinking for myself and taking back control of my food and health. Not only did I lose weight when I did this, my entire body changed.One of the first commitments I made was to start taking my lunch to work. Not only was it less expensive to do this, my health soared as a result.It all comes down to being prepared. Only youcan control what you eat on a daily basis, and it doesnt need to be complicated or expensive. I compiled alist here of 20 of my favorite foods to dineand munch on at the office. But first, Im going to warn you about some of the most common office foods that you should stay far, far away from  as they are no good for your health. These are the foods I would eat because they were there. Sitting there in the office break room or on a co-workers desk calling my name! Eventually giving up additive-filled food helped me finally say no thanks.Dont let your office be a breeding ground for food industry toxins! Getthese foods out of your office for good:1. Microwave PopcornWhen it comes to microwave popcorn, everything from the bag, the oil, and the corn, is bad news! Dont believe for a second that the delicious popcorn smell wafting into your office is a good thing! Food companies might not want to publicize all the details about artificial flavors, but some emit possibly toxic fumes. Artificial flavors are a secret concoction of ingredients that are not required to be disclosed, so you dont know whats really in them. The flavoring ingredient diacetyl, which some major manufacturers eliminatedfrom their artificial flavors, has been linked tolung diseaseamong employees at popcorn and flavoring production facilities. We dont know what these manufacturers have substituted diacetyl with and theres the possibility that some brands still use it because it hasnt been banned. A possible substitute for diacetyl is 2,3-pentanedione, which is linked tolung damage in animal studies. The bottom line is, you dont know what you are ingesting when it comes to artificial flavors  so its a good idea to avoid them.Some brands (like Jolly Time Healthy Pop and Pop Secret) still use partially hydrogenated soybean oil, a major source of artificial trans fat which is associated with up to 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths per year according to the CDC. To top it all off  some popcorn bags may be lined with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a chemical linked to cancer, and the popcorn itself may contain harmful pesticide residues.2. DonutsNo one thinks donuts are healthy, but this treat is super popular at meetings and I used to get excited when someoneplopped a box of these on the table. That was until I found out that commercially made donuts contain a lot more than just carbs and fat  theyre loaded with harmful additives too. A single frosted strawberry donut from Dunkin Donuts is slathered withhigh fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oils  an ingredient the FDA is considering toban and contains a slew of preservatives, emulsifiers, fake flavors and artificial color. Some commercially bought donuts even contain butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a preservative linked to cancer. Its not worth riskingyour health with these ingredients.3. SodaMost sodas contain high fructose corn syrup, natural flavors, and caramel coloring. When it comes to diet (low-calorie) soda, youre still not doing your body any favors.A calorie isnt a calorie when its made up of additives that affect how much you eat and the way your body metabolizes those chemicals. Low calorie beverages will not fight obesity,and if anything, the reliance on chemical-filled drinks just perpetuates the problem. Despite what you might have heard, artificial sweeteners have been shown to stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and thereby promote fat storage and weight gain. Recent research links it to nearlytripling abdominal fat!4. Supermarket Birthday CakesHow many times have you celebrated a co-workers birthday with a supermarket cake? The ingredient list on most store-bought cakes is so long I literally have trouble keeping count  but Ive seen close to 80 ingredients! The majority of them are fake chemical fillers and food-like substances that are obviously not real food, and its nearly impossible to find one without artificial colors and partially hydrogenated oils. Most cake manufacturers use no real cane sugar at all and the whole cake is sweetened with genetically modified sugar beets (which will just say sugar in the ingredients) or high fructose corn syrup. Some cakes also contain paraben ingredients, like propyl paraben, which is believed to be an endocrine disruptor linked to cancer.5. Frozen Processed LunchesI am so guilty of this. I used to think calorie-controlled frozen meals were actually a good way to stay slim. I was wrong. Just because theyre quick and low-calorie doesnt mean you should eat it. Ive never been in an office where someone doesnt pop a Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice entreein the microwave for lunch. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these meals contain a shocking number of harmful additives. A singleWeight Watchers Smart Ones Salisbury Steak meal containssodium phosphate, partially hydrogenated oil, caramel coloring and lots of hidden MSG. None of the ingredients are organic or non-GMO verified and its full of sugar and corn-derived ingredients.Stockup with these Top 20 Office Eats instead:1. Veggie sticks: This seems so obvious and simplebecause it is! Even when working at home, this is my daily go-to snack. Its easy tomake some matchsticks of carrots, celery, bell peppers, cucumbers or whatever raw veggies are your favorite. Pick veggies that are local, seasonal and organic.2. Hummus:This goes great with those raw veggie sticks, or you canalso use this as a dip for crackers. I recommend making your own, as most store-bought versions contain preservatives and soybean or canola oil. Plus  its super easy to make! (Hummus Recipe & Beet Hummus Recipe).3. Homemade Superfood Popcorn: I make this easyand deliciouspopcorn with 3 amazing ingredients: coconut oil, hemp seeds, red palm oil. All popcorn is non-GMO, but choose organic to minimize exposure to pesticides. Get the recipe here and put it in a reusable bag like this to bring to the office. Also you can buy some ready-made store bought organic popcorn like the one from Trader Joes that is made with olive oil.4. Trail mix: Mix up your own with personal favorites like raw almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, coconut flakes, and dried fruit. Walnuts in particular have been shown to enhancecritical thinking skills which is essential to performingyour best in the office. If you buy each of the ingredients separately inbulk bins at the grocery store (instead of pre-mixed packaged versions) you can save some serious cash.5. Fresh fruit: This is natures convenience food. Bring along grapes, bananas, apples, peaches, pears, berries, ect. Stick with seasonal, local and organic. I also love to snack on cherry tomatoes at my desk because they are convenient and not messy.6. Oatmeal: Make your own little packets of oatmeal with rolled oats, quick oats, cinnamon, and chia seeds. This is how I make oatmeal when Im not at home.7. Dates:These are full of fiber and nutrients, but they are super sweet like natures candy! Just one of these will satisfy your sweet tooth, and theyre super delicious stuffed with a walnut or almond butter. I also use dates to sweeten my oatmeal (dice it upand add it to the water before cooking the oats).8. Parfait Porridge: Thistastes like a berry parfait, minus the yogurt. The best part of this breakfast is the raw oat groats as theycontain more vitamins, minerals and nutrients than processed steel cut, rolled or instant oats. They are available in most health food stores inexpensively in the bulk section. Itonly takes a few minutes to put together the night before work and youll be super happy to have one in the morning for breakfast (I promise). I like tomake enough to last about 3 days and keep them in the fridge for busy mornings. Get the recipe here.9.Almond butter: This is great with apples,bananas, crackers, or stuffed into a date. You can buy individual packets here, if you dont want to keep an entire jar at the office.10:Green tea and herbal teas: Im always carrying around tea with me, wherever I go, because I drink it every day. Stick with organic teas that dont contain artificial and natural flavors and unnecessary additives (my favorite brand is Numi). I used this Breville kettle regularly when I worked outside of the home in an office to heat up water for my tea. Yes, I kept my kettle plugged in at my cubicle! (My cube mates loved using it too!) When you add up the cost of unhealthy andexpensive alternatives (sodas and lattes), the cost of a good tea kettle is a no brainer and it pays for itself pretty quickly. This kettle can also heat up water for cooking oatmeal.11. Kombucha:This naturally fermented drink made from tea is slightly sweet, tangy and refreshing. It also helps populate your gut with good bacteria, which can improve your digestion, strengthen your immune system, and may help you stay lean. You can also make your own kombucha soda at home on the cheap.12. Homemade Ginger Ale (or Seltzer Water with Fruit Slices):Theres no reason to ever hit up the soda machine in the break room anymore. If you crave the fizz, try packing some of my Homemade REAL Ginger Ale(recipe here), or simply marinateslices oflemons, limes, oranges (or other fruits) in some seltzer water for a refreshing drink.13. Salads: Its super easy to pack salads in a glass container, just keep the dressing on the side (or at the bottom of the container) to keep the greensfrom wilting. You can keep a few in ready-to-go containers in the fridge. Add in some beans, lentils, hemp seeds and quinoa for extra protein and try myMelt in Your Mouth Kale Salad,Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad, orCarrot Blueberry Sprout Salad recipes.One of my all-time fave salad dressing recipes is this Tahini Dressing (it will make a salad lover out of anyone).14. Sandwich Wraps:You dont even need a recipe necessarily, as I often just spread some hummus on a sprouted grain tortilla and wrap up some greens, chickpeas or lentils, bell peppers, shredded carrots, and whatever fresh veggies are in my fridge. Adding some pickles or kimchi adds some spicy saltiness. Recipes to try: Chickpea Curry Wrap and Chicken (or chickpea) Salad Sandwich.15. Homemade Cookies: Yes  I said cookies! These are great for those times when you want to treat your office mates with something sweet and avoid the dreaded donuts and supermarket birthday cakes. The best part about making them yourself is that you can reduce the amount of sugar and control exactly what you put into them. Try baking some homemadeLow Sugar Cookies or Forever Cookies.15. Golden Berries:These are natures little Sour Patch Kid, arent loaded with sugar and have 5 grams of fiber per ounce. You can buy them in most grocery stores and online here.16. Plain Yogurt:Before you leave for work toss in some fresh or frozen berries, banana slices, and if you like it a bit sweeter mix in someraw honey or maple syrup. Other great stir-ins are granola, chopped nuts or chia seeds. Just pack those separately and add them to the yogurt when youre ready to eat. Always choose plain organic yogurt  heres why. Its also super easy to make your own yogurt, check out my moms recipehere.17. Brads Raw Chips:For those times when you really want a crunchy chip, this is one of the best good for you chips on the market. Brads Raw Chips are made from raw and all whole foods  no gluten, sugar or added chemicals.18. Avocados:You can pop one open, and keep some salt and cayenne at your desk for sprinkling.19. Marys Gone Crackers or Pretzels: Stack these with avocado slices, bananas, almond butter or hummus  theyre very versatile and crunchy. Also great served alongside a salad for lunch.20.Green Smoothie: Theres a reason that this smoothie made the news  its both healthy and delicious!To make it quickly in the morning, wash and cut all of the veggies and fruit that you will be using the night before and store it in the fridge. That way in the morning you just pop it in the blender and pour it into a glass jar (like this one) to bring to work. You can even make smoothies the night before too and have them ready to grab and go. If you want added protein, blendin some hemp protein powder, hemp seeds, chia seeds or nut butters. Check out my favorite blenders here.No matter how busy you are, its possible to make a healthy lunchtime part of your daily routine.I hear from somany of you that youlack the time in the morning to pack a healthy lunch for work, and dont know where to start to make it simple enough to fit into your busy schedule. You find yourself hungry at lunchtime, with vending machines and fast food restaurants at every corner waiting to sabotage your goals. Thats why I created the Food Babe Eating Guide for you  check it out here.Do you know a co-worker or friend that could use this info?

54,Response: NY Times Lets Biased Freelancer Attack Food Babe – Vani Hari,http://foodbabe.com/2015/03/15/response-to-ny-times/,"This is a response to the NY Times article:Taking On the Food Industry, One Blog Post at a Time by Courtney Rubin, Published March 13, 2015I am very sad to have to post this rebuttal to the New York Times story about our movement. The Times is among the most respected newspapers in the world, but it violated its own standards of accuracy and fairness in Courtney Rubins story about me last week.This story is a classic one-sided hatchet job.You know the work we do is important to the health of millions. Weve demanded transparency, helped remove questionable chemicals from the food supply along with other respected groups, changed major multi-billion dollar food companies and educated many people.This unfortunately is not the focus of the story.The reporter featured only the views of certain academics who attack us  every single one of whom has a conflict of interest due to their associations with the food or chemical industries (and this is not disclosed). Although I gave Ms. Rubin the names of scientific, medical and consumer experts who support our work, these did not appear in the story, with one exception (Ken Cook of the Environmental Working Group) and even his quote was chosen to support her obvious bias.The Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, The National Academy of Sciences, The Center for Food Safety, and many respected medical and scientific authorities support reducing the synthetic chemicals used in our food. Authorities in the UK, the EU and Australia have banned many of the ingredients we have campaigned against, based on the scientific evidence. None of these were quoted or mentioned.Lets examine who wasDr. Joseph Schwarczis the Director of McGill Universitys Office for Science & Society, which has in the past received funding from the biotech (GMO) industry Dow, Monsanto, and Dupont through the Council for Biotechnology Information (1). Dr. Schwarcz is also on the Editorial Board for the magazine of the Chemical Institute of Canada, ACCN. Based on his advocacy,one could say Dr. Schwarcz hasnt met a chemical he doesnt like.Furthermore, he has made sexist remarks about me including one that was quoted by Bloomberg Businessweek: She gets on all these talk shows partly because she is easier to look at.Hes been highly and personally disrespectful to me (2) more than once in public comments. He saidIm addicted to the Food Babe, called methe stupid woman, I havezero knowledge, that hes concerned aboutthe location of my brain, andI aman American Hoax artist.He cyberbullies by asking his students to post repeated questions about my credentials over and over again on my Facebook wall, although they already know the answer. I sent this information to Ms. Rubin, but again she failed to mention it  instead glorifying his comments like a thoughtful critic.Ms. Rubin quotesKevin Folta, chair of the Horticultural Sciences Department at the University of Florida. He does not specialize in health or nutrition; rather he is a crop scientist specializing in GMOs who seeks industry funding and support for this research (3). He has repeatedly stated in the media he wishes to improve the public perception of GMO technology.Dr. Folta writes for GMOAnswers (4) a website thatsfunded by the biotechnology industry.Theres an obvious conflict of interest here  he is a pro-GMO activist and as you have read through my investigations, I have doubts about the technology and its role in the proliferation of chemicalsthat are impacting human health. I, along with the majority of Americans believe we should have the right to know whether we are consuming GMOs  he does not. UPDATE: Although Foltahas claimed publicly he has no relationship with Monsanto multiple times,it was found during a FOIA request that he received 25k from Monsanto. Evidence & detailshere,hereandhere. FOIA request also revealed emails that show evidence of coordinated messagingbetween executives at Monsanto and Monsantos PR Firm Ketchum.Professor Dr. Fergus Clydesdaleof the University of Massachusetts is on the Board of Sensient Technologies (5), aglobal manufacturer of colors, flavors and fragrances which means they make synthetic food additives. As you know, many experts find these artificial ingredients in food questionable and sometimes misleading  so of course he would oppose our work. He also served on the food industry front group International Food Information Council (5a). His argument that synthetic chemicals in the food supply are the equivalent of naturally occurring ingredients is not only disproven, but laughable. By his, and apparently this reporters logic, there should be no regulatory action taken against the proven carcinogens, obesegens, teratogens that cause birth defects, and synthetic estrogens or chemicals that have invaded our food supply and our bodies.The piece mentionsDr. David Gorski, who also has received pharmaceutical industry funding (6). He likes to vilify quackery, and has even attacked the venerable Cleveland Clinic for using some alternative medicine (7). He is simply wrong that there is no propylene glycol, the antifreeze kind, in some beers and alcohol. We know Fireball Whiskey contains it (8) and its listed as an approved ingredient in alcohol on the government website ttb.gov (9). This is easy to prove if you arent looking to discredit someone. I answered this previously in a response to my critics back in December2014 (10), but this was ignored and has been re-hashed time and time again.I truly thought when I agreed to be interviewed by Ms. Rubin, I was meeting with a fair and unbiased journalist. Based on the last 48 hours of repeated tweets by her and others (11) I see where her true colors lie. For example, she chose to favorite a tweet that called me Fraud Babe and that claimed my activism is purely an opaque money making operation. She retweeted a spokesperson from a hate Facebook group. Ms. Rubin also repeatedly tweeted accusationsat me. This is what harassment looks like, and is very unprofessional for a freelancer for the venerable New York Times. See screenshots below.Regardless of her agenda, Ms. Rubin has a history of being misled before (12) and looks like she is being duped again by an organizedfood industry campaign against us.Ms. Rubinsstory had many errors and omissions. Here are some of the biggest ones:The dough conditioner azodicarbonamide is banned in food in the EU, Australia and Singapore. FDA allows its use, as they do many chemicals banned abroad, relying solely on industry representations without independent testing, and often without testing of any kind. Both the EWG (13) and The Center For Science In The Public Interest (CSPI ) (14) supported my Subway petition to remove it from their bread and agree the FDA should remove it from the Generally Regarded As Safe or GRAS status. FDA approval sadly does not mean proven safe  this is well known and legislation has been proposed to address it. (15)I never said that microwave ovens are causing cancer. I said using them could create carcinogenic compounds. Many expertsadvise against microwaving food in plastic, for example, for just this reason. (16a, 16b)The beer investigation and petition was all about transparency. My objection to fish bladders in beer stems from the view that ingredients should be labeled, so that vegetarians can avoid them if they choose. I never said the ingredient is harmful. I responded to this argument in my beer investigations (17)  but this keeps getting rehashed as part of an intentional industry campaign to paint me as a fearmonger.Ken Cooks statements about me were taken out of context. Ken is an advisor of mine, and several of the ingredients weve campaigned against appear on his respected Environmental Working Groups list of the dirty dozen chemicals to avoid in the food supply. Of course this wasnt mentioned.I (just like the NY Times and most other bloggers & websites) remove comments on my website and on social media pages from people making blatantly sexist, objectionable remarks, using fake profiles, and those that conduct astroturf, organized campaigns to harass over and over again. No apologies for that. I also provided Ms. Rubin with a 2-paragraph explanation (via email with screen shots of examples) of our social media moderating methodology, and this was not mentioned.We want to interact with people who truly want to have a better food system  promoting healthy ingredients on a daily basis and create a positive environment. A healthy debate is fine, but someone can make their point without stepping over the line and becoming abusive.Ms. Rubin wrote that the dose makes the poison, which is not always true. In the case of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, for example, studies show that it is precisely the lowest doses that cause an effect (mimicking hormone levels in the body) while higher doses have none. This statement also ignores the very real  and unregulated  problem of the additive and synergistic effects of the cumulative soup of chemicals we are being exposed to everyday. (18)Since this reporter failed to do balanced reporting, I want to share this research by my friend and colleague Max Goldberg who documented the scientists and experts who do agree with our work. Its a must read.This story is just way outside the normal standards of a normally truly great newspaper. However, it wont daunt or stop us from pushing to clean up the food supply to improve the health of this country.Onward!VaniSources:1.http://web.archive.org/web/20070627055333/http://oss.mcgill.ca/ 2.

55,The Shocking Difference Between Organic & Non-GMO Labels – It’s Huge!,http://foodbabe.com/2015/02/26/difference-between-organic-non-gmo-labels/,"One of the things I love to do every year is visit The Natural Products Expo, I go to both shows every year (west coast and east coast) to see the types of natural products food companies are creating and meet the founders behind them. Every year I see more and more Non-GMO products being created which is a great sign of the times, but theres something really tricky and important you need to know about these products.Theres a lot of confusion and debate about what non-GMO and organic labels really mean.The labels are very different! Its crucial to understand the difference if you want to pick out the healthiest and safest food for you and your family. Every time we decide to buy a product, we are supporting so much more than our bodies. We are shaping the landscape of the entire food system  everything from the environment, land, air, water to the farmers themselves. And this is why I want you to know the truth about the Non-GMO label and what it really means.What exactly does the Non-GMO Project label mean?The Non-GMO Project label only verifies that aproductdoesnt contain genetically modified (GMO) ingredients (or technically less than 0.9% GMOs). While that is good, its not the whole story about what the product contains, how it was produced, and where it came from.But when I have a choice, I always choose organic food because of these reasons10 reasons whyOrganic beats Non-GMO every time:1. Certified organic foods are also non-GMO.USDA organic regulations prohibitany genetically modified (GMO) ingredients in a certified organic product. I avoid GMOs at all costs, and going organic is one of the easiest ways to do it. NOTE: The USDA Organic labelcertifies that 95%-100% of the ingredients are organic, so there is a slight chance that (up to 5%) of non-organic ingredients are in the producthowever they are not supposed tobe GMO. There are still some tricky loopholes, so thats why you need to look for 100% certified organic or a Non-GMO Project verified label to ensure its GMO-free.2. Organic crops cannot be grown with synthetic pesticides, and contain much lower pesticide residues overall.Organic regulations prohibit certain toxic pesticides from being used on crops, but there are no special restrictions for non-GMO crops. So, non-GMO crops can be grown the same as other conventional crops andcanstill be laden with toxic pesticide residues, including organophosphatesthat are linked tolymphoma and leukemia. A bag of non-GMO potato chips can contain residues from up to 35 different pesticides used on conventional potatoes, several of which are known carcinogens, suspected hormonedisruptors, neurotoxins, orreproductive toxins. Also non-GMO produce (like strawberries and celery) are on the EWGs Dirty Dozen Guide as the most contaminated with pesticides.While natural pesticides are allowed on organic crops, its been shown that organic produce hasvery low levels of pesticide residue compared with conventional crops, and by eating organic you can significantlydecrease your exposure to pesticide residues (source).3. The most widely-used herbicide on the planet  Glyphosate (Roundup)  is prohibited on organic crops. Non-GMO crops such as wheat can be pre-harvested with glyphosate. This herbicide is a toxin that can accumulate in your body the more you are exposed to it. It has been linked to kidney disease, breast cancer, and some birth defects. According to Dr. Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at MIT, glyphosate is largely responsible for the escalating incidence of autoimmune and other neurological disorders that we are experiencing. There are many non-GMO products on the market that contain wheat and seem healthy  but they could be laced with glyphosate. For instance, whole-wheat breads and non-GMO cereals that arent organic (like Grape Nuts)may contain glyphosate residues.4. Organic ingredients arent processed with toxic hexane. Most conventional oils (canola, soybean, corn) are extracted with the neurotoxin hexane, and some residue has been shown to remain in these oils. Hexane is also used in the processing of many soy ingredients like soy protein and textured vegetable protein, and testing done by The Cornucopia Institute has found residues insome ofthese ingredients. Almost all research focuses on the industrial use and inhalation ofhexane:No epidemiology or case report studies examining health effects in humans or chronic laboratory studies evaluating potential health effects in animals following oral exposure to n-hexane are available. Why isnt anyone studying how safe it is to have this neurotoxin in our food? Industrial exposure has beenlinkedto brain tumors and nerve damage. The FDA does not set a maximum residue level for hexane, and no one knows for sure how much residue is being consumed by the American public.Theresnothing prohibiting these ingredientsin non-GMO products, but hexane-processed ingredientsarebanned from products with the USDA Organic seal.5. Organic crops are prohibited from beingfertilized with sewage sludge. Conventional non-GMO crops can be treated with biosolids, which is literally the treated waste thats flushed down the toilet, and waste from hospitals and industry. This waste can be contaminated with such things as heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, pathogens, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dioxins  its basically a toxic chemical soup! Its been shown that some of these contaminants are absorbed into (or remain as residue on) the crops that we eat. These residueshaveproven deadly to cattle that have grazed on crops fertilized with biosolids, and it certainly isnt something we should be eating.6. Organicmeat isnt produced withgrowth-promoting drugs, like ractopamine. Packagednon-GMO foods maycontain meatthat has been raised on growth-promoting steroids and drugs.Residues of some of these drugs have been found in meat and its been shown that eating products with traces of ractopaminecan lead to an unacceptable level of risk of diseases of the cardiovascular system.7. Organic animals arentfattened up with growth-promoting antibiotics.The overuse of growth-promoting antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population. Antibiotics have been used for years, not just to fight infection, but to fatten up farm animals. This use is polluting our environment, water and food supply. Studies show that antibiotics have the same consequences for us, and can fatten us up too. This is because antibiotics kill off healthy bacteria in the gut  beneficial bugs called probiotics that influence how we absorb nutrients, burn off calories, and stay lean. Scientists have found that lean people have more of the good, anti-obesity bacteria in their guts, compared to people who are overweight. Growth-promoting antibioticsare only being used to increase industry profits andthe bestway to stop these practices is to refuse to buy products made with them.8. The non-GMO label claim is unregulated.Essentially anyone can say that their product is non-GMO, because the FDA has not set any standards to regulate the use of this claim on a label. This is not to be confused with theNon-GMO Project label, as they have a processfor verifying whether products are non-GMO, andI feel that their label can be trusted(just as Whole Foods will only label products as non-GMO if they carry the Non-GMO Project verification label or are certified organic). However, some food manufacturers have been caught red-handedwith unverified claims on their packages that say they are non-GMO when they really arent. As no independent 3rd party testing is required to verify their claims, there is some corruption going on. For instance, when Consumer Reports tested Xochitl tortilla chips with a non-GMO claim on the bag, they found GMO corn in them. Since most of these non-verified products have not been 3rd party tested and there are no government regulations, its not a reliable label claim.Theres another big reason to eat organic It can help you stay thin!9.Organic foods prohibit many of the chemicals known as obesogens that trigger our bodies to store fat.Antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, and synthetic preservatives are just a few of the chemicals that researchers have defined asobesogens. The theory that obesogens in our food and environment could be making us fat has been gathering steam ever since researcher Paula Baillie-Hamilton published an article in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2002, presenting strong evidence that chemical exposure caused weight gain in experimental animals. As reported in the New York Times piece, Warnings From A Flabby Mouse, exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can cause weight gain. This is important because many of the synthetic pesticides that can be found on non-GMO conventional crops are endocrine disruptors. Also  the sewage sludge fertilizing some of these crops has been shown to contain endocrine disruptors. Minimizing your exposure to obesogensby choosing an organic dietmay be the boost you need to lose weight and keep it off.Source: NY TimesThe only difference between these mice: The one at the top was exposed at birth to a tiny amount of an endocrine-disrupting chemical  these chemicals can be found in synthetic pesticides sprayed on non-GMO and conventional crops.10. By choosing organic food youll automatically avoid most of the Sickening 15 ingredients that I talk about in my new book, The Food Babe Way. Chemicalslike synthetic preservatives, synthetic pesticides, growth hormones and antibiotics are not used in organic food. These are the chemicals that can make you tired, wreck havoc on your skin, make you feel fat and miserable, even though youve been dieting and exercising like crazy. Even worse  they may put you at risk for scary, life-shortening diseases like cancer.Im not saying thatall organic products are perfect. Some of them contain suspect chemicals too.While its best to choose organic unprocessed food whenever you have the opportunity, its still very important to read ingredient lists on organic packaged products.Some organic and non-GMO products contain unnecessary additives and non-organic additives that can be detrimental to your health and waistline. Look for (and avoid)these ingredients in organic and non-GMO foods:Hidden MSG  Although monosodium glutamate is prohibited in organic food, they can useother forms of free glutamic acidsuch as Yeast Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Textured Protein. These chemicals are excitotoxins and can greatly influence how much you eat. For a full list of these hidden MSG additives, check out my new book  The Food Babe Way.Carrageenan  Its alarming that this ispermitted in organic food. According to research conducted byThe CornucopiaInstitute, animal studies showthat food-grade carrageenan causes gastrointestinal inflammation and higher rates of intestinal lesions, ulcerations, and even malignant tumors. Food grade undegraded carrageenan iscontaminatedwith degraded carrageenan (the kind thats not considered food grade). The World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Research Council of the United Stateshave both determinedthat degraded carrageenan is a carcinogen.Unhealthy Oils  Non-GMOcanola oil isused in some products, but canola oil consumption islinkedtovitamin E deficiencyand ashortened life spanin animal studies. Likewise, I often see sunflower and safflower oils on the label, which arevery high in omega-6 fatty acids, and not the healthiest oil to use.Natural Flavors  These are not so natural, as they are created in a lab,may contain addicting chemicalsand up to 100 secret ingredients.If you know someone who needs to know this truth  please share this post with them! Its so important that we keep spreading the word about what these labels really mean. The more we know, the better we all are!Xo,Vani255K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

59,Gingerbread Cupcakes With Coconut Icing,http://foodbabe.com/2013/12/03/gingerbread-cupcakes-with-coconut-icing/,"I made these gingerbread cupcakes for a family get together last weekend and they were an absolute hit! I love gingerbread, especially given the season  all that yummy smelling ginger, cinnamon, and cloves baking in the oven, so good! What makes these cupcakes unique however, is the icing! I love making healthier icing because it is usually the worst part of any cupcake recipe. This one uses a unique blend of coconut manna or coconut butter, a little maple syrup, vanilla and coconut flakes for a festive look.Coconut manna is basically dried coconut meat that is blended until really smooth like butter (just like almonds are ground and blended into almond butter). Coconut manna can replace many dairy ingredients like milk, cream cheese and butter.For the cake part, I love using a mix of almond flour and coconut flour or entirely spelt flour. Ive made them both ways and they turn out fantastic every time. Coconut flour is much drier and absorbent than the average flour so if youre substituting it, youll need to make some adjustments  for every 1/2 cup of coconut flour, you will want to add more liquid to your recipes. An extra egg does the trick!And its no secret Im a huge fan of coconut oil andcoconut sugar to replace any refined oil or white sugar in recipes. Coconut sugar has more vitamins and minerals than any other type of sugar, its completely unrefined and considered a low glycemic sugar that has a smaller effect on blood sugar. And thankfully Nutiva (who I buy all my coconut products from because they support GMO labeling and my investigations) sources their coconut sugar sustainably without hurting the environment or animals.    4.9 from 14 reviews   Gingerbread Cupcakes With Coconut Icing     Print     Prep time  5 mins    Cook time  25 mins    Total time  30 mins      Serves: 12-24   Ingredients   cup coconut oil  cup coconut sugar  cup molasses 1 egg (or flax egg (combine 1 tbsp ground flaxseed with 3 tbsp water)) 1 and  cup spelt flour (gluten free option: 1 cup almond flour +  cup coconut flour + 1 more egg)  tablespoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon  teaspoon salt  teaspoon ground cloves  cup boiling water  tablespoon baking soda     Instructions  Preheat oven to 350 and line muffin tins with baking cups In a bowl, combine coconut oil, coconut sugar, and molasses and egg and mix well In a medium bowl whisk flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and cloves.

60,Don’t Fall Victim To These Tricky Juice Labels,http://foodbabe.com/2013/11/10/juice-labels/,"Theres nothing like making fresh raw vegetable or fruit juice at home with your own juicer. But lets be honest, it takes time, energy and a commitment to keep up the routine at home. The availability and the variety of store-bought juice concoctions have absolutely exploded on the market and tempt us with convenience, fancy marketings and a bunch of healthy buzz words. Heres the scoop on how tricky understanding juice labels can be at the grocery store and how to choose the best store bought juices for you and your family.100% Juice Doesnt Mean AnythingWhat does 100% juice really mean? Not much. Food companies are allowed to say 100% juice on the label even though their juice contains additional additives, flavorings or preservatives. In the case of V8, they add sodium (salt), flavoring, vitamin C and citric acid to preserve the juice for a longer shelf life. All of these added ingredients do nothing for your body and in some cases could harm you. This isnt exactly a healthy dose of juice after considering the flavoring on the label could bemade from petroleum that is often contaminated with carcinogens. Also, flavoring could have hidden MSG in it  which increases cravings and addiction (so food companies profit more). Companies that use flavoring wont tell you exactly whats in it either, theyll say their formula is proprietary and keep you guessing.Concentrate Is Just A Fancy Name for SyrupAnother way juice companies sabotage you, is by using shelf-stable juice concentrates instead of real juice. Juice concentrates are made from fruits and vegetables that are heated down to syrup and then have water added back in. The concentration process involves both adding in and subtracting chemicals and natural plant by-products in order to condense the juice. During the concentration process, fruits and vegetables lose flavor and this is one of the reasons why companies have to re-add flavoring to make the juice taste fresh.The concentration allows juice companies to keep their juice shelf stable, preserved longer and allows them to save money during fruit processing. In other words, juice companies sell you an inferior product while making more money.Not From Concentrate Could Be FlavoredWhat if the label explicitly states not from concentrate. Does that mean that the product has no added flavors? No. Actually, thats a big fat no! When most commercially available orange juices are made, according to the book Squeezed: What You Dont Know About Orange Juice,the juice is stored in giant tanks and the oxygen is removed from them, which allows the liquid to keep for up to a year without spoiling. This storage makes the orange juice lose mega flavor. So the industry uses flavor packs to re-flavor the juice. Even if your juice says 100% juice or premium on the ingredient label, it can still have these flavor packs, because they are not required to be listed on the ingredient label because technically they are derived from orange essence or oil. Sneaky, huh?Ever wonder why store-bought juice can achieve that consistent trademarkedtaste, bottle after bottle? Now you know! (Please note: Uncle Matts is a brand that is 100% juice, not from concentrate that specifically does not use flavor packs.)GMOsMany juice companies use an ingredient called citric acid to extend the shelf life of their product. Most people would think this citric acid comes from, well, citrus like lemons, oranges and limes, but it doesnt. The ingredients most food manufacturers use to create citric acid aregenetically engineered corn and sugar beets, by synthetically fermenting the glucose from these crops in a laboratory.Also, some juice companies go as far as adding sugar (that could be from GMO sugar beets), high fructose corn syrup (from GMO corn) and/or other ingredients that could contain GMOs. Tropicana, Ocean Spray and Minute Maid are huge offenders of this  so its no surprise they were some of the companies who gave millions of dollars recently in Washington to stop GMO labeling. They dont want you to know their juices are full of GMOs.Remember GMOs have never been tested long term on humans, and are linked to the rise in allergies, infertility and auto-immune disorders, not to mention they have increased the use of toxic pesticides in the environment by 500 million pounds.It is absolutely critical we get GMO labeling in this country. We deserve the right to know what we are eating and the companies fighting against this basic fundamental right do not deserve our money.Synthetic IngredientsThe sneakiest of ingredients that can show up in juice are in the form of synthetic ingredients that seem natural but are actually man-made and created in a laboratory.Naked Juice (owned by Pepsi Co) was recently sued because they claimed their juices were 100% All Natural but really contain these synthetic ingredients:Fibersol-2  a proprietary synthetic digestion-resistant fiber produced by Archer Daniels Midland and developed by a Japanese chemical company.Fructooligosaccharides  a synthetic fiber and sweetener.Inulin  an artificial and invisible fiber added to foods to artificially increase fiber content.This example is just one of the reasons why its incredibly important to look at the ingredient list rather than the marketing lingo on the front of the label. (FYI  The Wall Street Journal just reported, Pepsi plans to drop the All Natural label on Naked Juice)Also, make sure to watch out for other harmful ingredients like artificial food coloring. I was shocked to see that so many innocent looking juice brands use petroleum based dyes to color their juices, like Ocean Sprays Red Ruby Grapefruit Juice.PasteurizationHeres the real killer, no pun intended. Most juice companies use traditional pasteurization or flash pasteurization to destroy harmful bacteria, viruses, molds, and other microorganisms to safeguard our health by heating the juice (this would be the second time your juice is heated if you are drinking juice from concentrate). But during this process, pasteurization also kills raw enzymes, minerals and vitamins  the reason that we are drinking the juice in the first place. Heat kills the bad stuff and good stuff, making the juice pretty much worthless to consume.Juice companies sometimes even replenish the lost vitamin content with synthetic vitamins because there is barely any nutrition left after processing. In the book Pandoras Lunchbox, Melanie Warner questions what happens during processing and determined like vitamins, phytochemicals are being destroyed or removed in manufacturing and therefore arent particularly abundant in processed juices. Adding them back in wouldnt work from a biological point of view, meaning they dont function effectively when isolated from their natural fruit and vegetable habitat. Furthermore, most companies create vitamins by chemical manipulation and synthesis, not from actual fruits and vegetables.Choosing The Best JuiceSo you must be wondering, are there any store-bought juices that are nutritious to drink? I created this chart below to help you navigate the juice aisles more clearly and choose the best store-bought juice. Thankfully, there are lots of options for us!OrganicIt is absolutely critical that you choose organic juice first and foremost. The amount of pesticides that you could be consuming could be astronomical otherwise. We know that increased exposure to pesticides islinkedto birth defects, nerve damage and cancer.The Presidents Cancer Panelhas urged us not to consume food sprayed with pesticides and doesnt believe any amount is safe.RawIn an ideal world, you would always be able to consume a juice raw straight out of a juicer. Enzymes, vitamins and minerals start to degrade over time, so timing is important. If your juice is fresh, its important to drink it as soon as possible.Cold-PressedCold-pressing is the most nutritious way to obtain juice. First, the produce is ground into a fine pulp. Then a press applies thousands of pounds of pressure to the pulp extracting every ounce of juice that the fruit or vegetable has to give. This process gets all the vital nutrients from the pulp into the juice.Cold-Pressed juices have a longer shelf life than centrifuge or slow juicers. Juice Press, Organic Avenue, andLunas Living Kitchen(One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!)all have raw organic cold-pressed juice available for purchase in their stores. Health food stores like Whole Foods sometimes makes their cold press juices in advance or carries brands like Suja, that are found in the refrigerator section.HPPThe next best thing to raw in-store cold pressed juice is HPP orHigh Pressure Processing. This method retains food quality, maintains freshness, and extends microbiological shelf life without the addition of heat. After juices are bottled, a high level of cool pressure is applied evenly to destroy any pathogens and ensure the juice is safe to drink while preserving all of the vitamins, enzymes and nutrients. Grocery stores like Whole Foods likes selling HPP juices because they safeguard the consumer from foodborne illnesses more effectively than raw juices. Suja is a popular organic juice brand that uses HPP, but also cold-presses their juice (and gave money in support of GMO labeling  yeah!). Their Twelve Essentials is one of my favorites. They also recently developed a line called Suja Elements that is more like a smoothie. Its the type of product youd choose over Naked Juice, Odwalla, or Bolthouse Farms Smoothies  since all of those are traditionally pasteurized with heat and can contain additives. See this smoothie comparison chart below for details:Finding Organic Pressed Juice Near YouMy friend Max Goldbergcreated theworlds first Pressed Juice Directory, where you can find organic juice wherever you are. He created this directory because he (like me) tries to eat 100% organic whenever possible and wanted the ability to find quality juice on the road while he traveled. I cant thank him enough for this amazing tool! It makes finding organic juice and traveling so much easier.If you have any questions about choosing the best store-bought juice, let me know in the comments below.Also, if you know someone in your life that is still drinking a juice thats on the worst side of the chart above, please share this post with them. Spreading awareness about how our food is produced and which companies we should support will change the marketplace!Ive seen this with my own eyes Food Babe471K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

61,How Pepperidge Farm Duped My Family,http://foodbabe.com/2013/06/26/how-pepperidge-farm-duped-my-family/,"This is a picture of me on my first birthday. My father was clearly holding me back from taking a chunk out of my cake with my hand. Now I dont remember this day exactly  but I do remember this Pepperidge Farm Golden 3 Layer cakebecause we had it more than just on my 1st birthday, we ate it all of the time. I also remember having the worst asthma and allergies as a child too, but of course did not realize those symptoms were related to what I was eatingMy parents were the first people in their respective families to come to America from India and did not have a slew of homemade family cake recipes to choose from when celebrating events. Growing up, my Mom did make the BEST Indian desserts ever, but that didnt matter. My family wanted to celebrate like everyone else in America  with cake! I remember this cake so vividly and can almost taste it in my mouth right now. We had it countless times throughout the years. It came out of the freezer section in a white box and I will never forget having to wait forseveral long grueling minutesfor it to thaw on the counter.Little did we know at the time, but we were clearly being duped. What we thought we were getting and what we actually ended up consuming were 2 totally different things. My poor unsuspecting foreign parents figured it was frozen because it had been baked fresh (probably on a farm like the label suggested) and needed to be preserved. They were clueless to the fact that it was actually preserved not by freezing, but by a slew of chemicals and other artificial ingredients that helped keep it from breaking down, and to keep it fresh.GMOs were not in production or even invented yet on my 1st birthday  so this cake went from pretty bad to REALLY bad in the late 1990s when food companies like Pepperidge Farm started sneaking GMOs into our food. This was right around the time I left the house for college and discovered Costco cake, which I thought was better (butthats another story) and stopped eating this cake.Looking back at this photo, I wanted to understand why the heck a company named after a farm would sell junk food filled with garbage like this? I was downright shocked when I learned the history of Pepperidge Farm and how it started.The founder Margaret Rudkin had a son who was asthmatic and had an allergy to commercially baked products that contained preservatives and artificial ingredients. He would have terrible reactions when he ate the bread sold in their towns local bakery, so she decided to make her own bread without additives. The sons doctor saw an immediate improvement in her sons allergies after making the switch to home baked bread and started to recommend her bread to his patients with asthma. He eventually convinced Margaret to sell the baked goods to small grocers throughout the area. She named the company after her familys farm  Pepperidge. Her baked goods became very popular especially after she visited Europe to discover what is known as the Milano cookie and Goldfish cracker from Switerzerland and brought it back to the states to sell her own licensed version. Campbell Soup bought her company in 1961 and Margaret continued as the head of the company until she died in 1967. I am not sure when Campbell Soup completely destroyed the integrity and quality of her products  but looking at the ingredients in Pepperidge Farm products today, there is NO WAY these ingredients would be considered natural, free of artificial ingredients, additives and preservatives, like Margaret originally intended for her products.Case in point  Gold Fish is being sued right now for misleading labeling and false advertising. On the label of Gold Fish it states Natural and No Artificial Preservatives, however, the product is made with genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs)  namely canola or soybean oil. How can a company claim something is natural when they are using ingredients made in a laboratory?Remember there is nothing natural about taking DNA, a virus or bacteria from one species and inserting it into another. GMOs are man made, not tested for long term human safety and pose disastrous consequences to our water, land and the entire food supply.Ive been quoted before saying that I think Gold Fish is one of the most dangerous products on supermarket shelves. The reason I say this is because they are so friendly, unassuming, made with smiles and look natural enough for millions of families to feed them to themselves and their children. In actuality, they are nothing more than refined white flour colored with annatto, made with GMO oils and a certain special ingredient called autolyzed yeast that is actually a hidden form of MSG. This ingredient is probably the most disastrous because it stimulates the brain cells to remember a taste, make you want more and enhance the flavor of something that would other wise not taste as addicting. This is the first cracker that millions of children eat and this has to stop.When I saw a new product on the shelf from Pepperidge Farm called Baked Naturals  I thought it was a pretty daring move considering the recent lawsuit and all the potential GMO ingredients it contains in the form of various oils, cornstarch and soy lecithin.Recently, I was delighted to find out Pepperidge Farm removed artificial coloring from their line of Gold Fish and created a new Mac & Cheese product that is colored naturally. However, it would have been nice for them to leave out the yeast extract  another form of hidden MSG and possible GMOs in the form of maltodextrin.There is even Gold Fish shaped 100% whole wheat bread that is full of GMOs, preservatives and other ingredients likecarrageenanthat are seriously questionable because of their link to intestinal inflammation. So many moms are buying this product for their children thinking it is natural and healthy, but that cant be farther from the truth.Pepperidge Farms Light Style Wheat bread has fooled me in the past. I thought I hit the jackpot, getting to eat two slices of bread for 80 calories, but the only person hitting the jackpot was Pepperidge Farm by taking my money and millions of other peoples money and selling us cheap ingredients in the form of GMOs, high fructose corn syrup, dough conditioners (DATEM is linked to asthma), preservatives and artificial sugars.The artificial sweetener Sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda) is added to keep the calories down, make it unnaturally sweet and get you addicted. Recent research out of Europe showedrats developed leukemiaafter consuming Sucralose. This is obviously an ingredient no one should be consuming especially if you are trying to lose weight.Diet breads are worthless when they contain artificial sweeteners because they increase sugar cravings and promote weight gain.Thats right  consuming artificial sweeteners actually increases your appetite. Think about it  when someone consumes something that is sweet, but it has little to no calories  their brain receives a signal to want more calories because their body is not actually getting any energy (i.e. enough calories) to get satisfied. So that person keeps looking for gratification elsewhere and ends up craving more.The thing that makes me the most angry about Pepperidge Farm cookies is their fancy packaging. Its like they were specially made just for me with those fancy compartments divided with paper cupcake holders. They make it seem like you are buying such a premium upscale and high quality product  it even says the word Distinctive on the label. These Milano cookies, along with other flavor varieties contain nothing but cheap worthless ingredients that do nothing in terms of nutrition for your body. Quality cookies do not contain partially hydrogenated oils, but instead real butter.If Margaret Rudkin were alive today  what would she think? Do you think she would have sold her company to Campbell Soup knowing that her products would turn into the same ones that caused her son so much trouble?Luckily, I havent seen any Pepperidge Farm products in my familys pantry for a long time now and I hope it stays that way. I obviously havent bought this brand in a while and thankfully dont have bad asthma or allergies anymore either.If you know someone who still buys Pepperidge Farm products, please share this post with them.There is no more integrity left in their brand and they do not deserve anyones hard earned money.Wishing you the greatest health imaginable,Food Babe273K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

62,Birke Reports: What’s Really In Your Local Meat?,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/13/birke-reports-gmos-in-meat/,"This post is written by Birke Baehr, a 14 year-oldorganic farming advocate and author.I am thrilled Birke is a regular contributor here on Food Babe, inspiring other children and adults across the nation to eat local, Non-GMO and organic.Hey everyone! I am so thankful to Vani & the Food Babe blog for having me on as a guest blogger.As some of you may know I am a youth advocate for sustainable food & farming. I am very concerned about the production of genetically engineered food and crops. Im also a large supporter of getting to know your farmer. I believe everyone should buy local and that it is important to be able to shake hands with the person that grew your food. Im always visiting farms and getting to see how the farmers raise their animals and/or produce.When talking to the majority of my local pasture based dairy or meat farmers, I always ask if they use any type of supplemental feed usually made from corn or soy. If they do use any, I ask them if it contains any genetically engineered ingredients. I usually hear from them that itdoes containgenetically modified (GMO) products and this fact upsets me.The one thing I get told time and time again is that non-GMO feed or even organic feed is too expensive.Every time I hear a farmer blame the price of non-GMO feed for not using it, I become even more determined to find a solution for them.We must not only pay attention to GMO ingredients in additives and in raw form, but we must keep an eye out for 2nd generationGMO food, likefeed or grain for livestock.Many people dont realize that they are consuming GMO food when they buy non-organic or local meat. If you buy local (or grass-finished, or pasture raised)  you are doing a great thing, but when the farmer is using GMO food to feed the livestock that can be passed down to you.GMO food that is fed to animals has been linked to sickening them with diseases, like kidney & liver toxicity, cancer, infertility, birth defects, and death.Scientists have found genetically engineered D.N.A. in animal tissue, that we end up consuming in the end.We must find a solution to this issue. I want to help farmers source local non-GMO or organic feed for a fair price. A co-op of produce farmers, land owners, seed suppliers, and monetary backers should be formed. A co-op would have three key benefits:Stop farmers from having to truck feed from across the country.Eliminate farmers having to resort to GM feed.Help farmers obtain organic feed without having to pay a fortune.This idea I hope will sprout up across the country in many different regions, so the farmers and everyone involved will make money. We need to let our farmers know every time we go to the market, we will not settle for GMO feed. Until this idea becomes reality, I dont mind paying the extra price for the farmers that do use organic feed because in the end the real price well pay will be our health and well being.If you are raising livestock and looking for non-GMO feed  check out the resource guide from the non-GMO shopping guidehere. (Especially for all you backyard chicken folks!)And remember to buy organic meat or avoid conventional meat altogether if you want to stop consuming 2nd generation GMO food. I know Food Babe highly suggests this all the time.Thanks for Reading!BirkeMore About Birke Baehr  An Internationally recognized speaker and youth advocate for sustainable food and agriculture, Birke has visited and volunteered at farms around the United States and recently published his first book, Birke On The Farm.

63,From One Babe To Another: #DumpKraft,http://foodbabe.com/2013/04/15/from-one-babe-to-another-dump-kraft/,"I want to share a letter I sent today to the man behind the newest Kraft Commercial. Kraft is using this new campaign to distract peoples attention away from the petroleum based artificial dyes they use in Mac & Cheese to hot sexy abs. Lets not let them detract from the real issue at hand.Watch the the latest Kraft Commercial Video HEREDear Anderson Davis, akaThe Zesty Guy,Hi, its Vani Hari aka the Food Babe here! From one babe to another, Ive got something really important to ask you. I saw the recent Kraft commercial you are starring in, and boy was it hot! So it got me thinking. Kraft is one of the largest food companies here in the US, and it makes total sense why they would want your face on their brand especially after all the negative publicity they have experienced as of late with another babe, me. The reason why they want to change the conversation to your face and abs is because they dont want Americans to know they are being exploited. Let me explain.I recently discovered that several American brands are using harmful additives that are not used  and in some cases banned  in other countries. One of those products is an iconic staple that almost every American has had at one time or another: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the US contains the artificial food dyes Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 made from petroleum, however Kraft reformulated this product in the U.K. using natural dyes, paprika and beta carotene when they found out these dyes were going to require a warning label.These unnecessary  yet potentially harmful dyes are linked to hyperactivity in children, asthma, allergies, migraines and are contaminated with carcinogens (substances that cause cancer!).The worst part, all of Krafts Mac & Cheese products marketed towards children contain these artificial dyes. I noticed you are a family man and have children. Would you let your child be pumped up with questionable petroleum-based ingredients and support a company that uses them here but not in other countries? How can we trust Kraft with our children? It is completely unfair to us that Kraft has reformulated the exact same product in other countries without petroleum. Dont we deserve the same safer version our friends get overseas?Well, you are not alone, actually over 280,000 people thought it was unfair too and last month signed a petition to ask Kraft to remove these dyes. Many of the people who signed the petition have either been affected by these dyes themselves or have had children who have experienced negative consequences. The letters I have personally received are heartbreaking.After basically no response from Kraft (other than this letter to their fans), I decided to go to Chicago and deliver the signatures to their front door step on the same day they launched your new commercial (coincidence, I think not). Because of social media pressure, they eventually caved and let me in for a discussion, however all they did was just reiterate their position, and asked me to agree to disagree with them. Kraft does not put the safety of their consumers as their highest priority, rather it is their bottom line, and they confirmed this during my meeting with them.Kraft obviously missed a huge opportunity to do the right thing, and now many concerned consumers are boycotting not only Mac & Cheese, but their entire line of products  including the dressing you are so famously known for now. So lets talk about this dressing. Kraft Zesty Italian contains a couple of ingredients you should know about ASAP.Vinegar, Water, Soybean Oil, Canola Oil, Sugar, Salt, Contains Less Than 2% of Garlic*, Garlic, Red Bell Peppers*, Onions*, Xanthan Gum, Spice, Oleoresin Paprika, Potassium Sorbate And Calcium Disodium Edta (to Protect Freshness). *Dried.The ingredients in red above are likely all GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms). Oh you dont know what GMOs are?Let me fill you in on that too.GMOs are not sexy.Theyare ingredients that are made in a laboratory with seeds that have been injected with DNA from another plant, animal or virus. GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) threaten our entire farmland and there has been no long term testing on humans, even though they were sneaked into our food supply in the late 1990s. Companies like Kraft dont want you to know they are using them, in fact, they spent 2 million dolllars last year against the labeling of these GMOs. Over 64 countries label or regulate GMOs, but companies like Kraft are preventing that from happening here because they value their pocketbook over Americans health.You used to play baseball right?Considering all of this, I find it hard for you to really want to be on the same team as Kraft  promoting not only GMO dressing, but supporting a company that is exploiting Americans for profit. I watched a couple of your recent interviews and you seem like a such a nice down to earth guy, so I hope youll consider this request.I am asking you to end your relationship with Kraft until they listen to over 280,000 people who signed the petition to remove dyes from Mac & Cheese. It doesnt help your image to be part of a dishonest, deceptive and hypocritical brand. To most people, it looks like you sold out for the bad guys, but I think this can be turned around pretty quickly and make you look like a hero. And besides, The Hero Guy will sound way cooler to your kids anyways.You recently said on Twitter and Facebook,if you could do it all over again youd be a country music star. Its not too late for that either. I will even help you come up with a song to sing about the GMOs in Kraft dressing if you like. Continuing to be The Zesty Guy will only make you look like The Sellout Guy. Its time to follow your true passion and dump Kraft.I hope we can be friends one day, us babes need to stick together (but um not like that, I have a husband for goodness sakes!).I have faith that you will make the right decision, if you have the brains to match those good looks.Love,Food BabePLEASE TAKE ACTION AND SHARE THIS LETTER:Help me and 280,000+ other voices get heard and tell The Zesty Guy to end his relationship with Kraft until Kraft removes artificial dyes from Mac & Cheese.

It was an email from Chris Arnold, the Communications Director at Chipotle, that read Tadah! in the subject line and had a link attached to the body of the email.The link directed me to the Chipotles website where they finally released a comprehenstive list of all their ingredients online.Back in August of last year, I did an investigationthat ultimately left me frustrated with the company. When inquiring about the ingredients  I was met with significant challenge and had to work my way around the corporate headquarters to actually find out the ingredients.Heres an excerpt and infographic from my investigation that sums up my experience quite nicely When I emailed Chipotle asking for the ingredients in certain products they downright refused. They in turn asked if I was concerned about a specific ingredient or had an allergy. Really? Why do I have to be concerned about a specific ingredient or have an allergy to want to know what I am eating and whats in my food? When I tried to call them, there was no way for me to leave a message or get a person on the phone to answer my questions. Email responses were S-L-O-W. I had to ask very specific questions to get the data I needed to write this  specific questions that most consumers would likely not ask. Thank goodness for the genuinely accommodating employee who shared some of the ingredients with me (behind his Managers back) so I could give you the full story.A few weeks after my investigation, Chris from Chipotle contacted me and asked me to meet with him, so I could better understand their challenges with posting their ingredient list. Ive been in contact with him ever since  asking for periodic updates and making sure he knew I wasnt going to let Chipotle off the hook. To keep the pressure on, some folkswere so inspired by theinvestigation, that they created apetition on my behalf, where 2400+ people shared their voice in concern.  So that begs the question  whats really in Chipotles food now that we can easily find the ingredients and read them for ourselves? Some of the original results of my investigation still hold true  but Chipotle made a major oil switch in some of their products like the black beans that dont use GMO oil any longer and has made a fanastic committment to eliminate the transfat, preservatives and other GMO ingredients in the future.As you can see  putting pressure on companies to change their ingredients and petitioning them to change their practices leads to actual results. We together are changing the food system  and today we have a win in terms of true transparency and knowing whats in our food!If you live in Manhattan  Chipotle is using rice bran oil instead of the GMO soybean oil for meat preparation  so for you lucky New Yorkers, you can avoid the GMO oil they currently use in their chicken and beef.For the rest of us, in the meantime, I still wouldnt order the chicken, beef, tortilla products, rice, salad dressing or chips  those items still contain GMO soybean oil. In several states, the chips and corn tortillas have benzoic acid  a preservative that I would avoid at all costs. Studies have shown this ingredient to be linked to decreased good bacteria in the gut in animal studies. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative increaseshyperactivityin children. Also, when this acid combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can form benzene,carcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Chipotles burrito and flour taco shells havepartially hydrogenated vegetable oils (a.k.a. trans fat). A 40-calorie-per-day increase in trans fat intake can lead to a23% higher risk of heart disease. 40 calories is a mere 2% of a typical 2000 calorie per day diet. Trans fats can be deadly even in a small amount and as you can see will easily add up if you go over one serving size.Also the pinto beans, contain pork bacon and have sodium nitrate  a substance linked tocancer,heart disease,anddiabetes.I have to be completely honest, I havent been to Chipotle in over six years, but I wouldnt be shy about eating there again now that I know I can order some options without GMOs, preservatives, and transfat. Im actually pretty excited about that fact.This is what my order would look like if I went there A salad with:Organic black beansRomaine lettuceFresh tomato salsa (and maybe try the others without the corn)A huge serving of guacamolePossibly sour cream or cheese if I were feeling fancyIf you are a meat eater  you could add pork carnitas to that list  since they do not use any GMO oil during the cooking preparationI hope you celebrate this accomplishment with me and praise Chipotle for their changes.Its a great day in the world  however, we have a lot more work to do, dont we? I can only wonder when Kraft will have the courage to meet with us and address the concerns of over 270,000+ consumers.Food BabeP.S.

66,Are Over-The-Counter Medicines Making You Sick?,http://foodbabe.com/2013/02/26/are-over-the-counter-medicines-making-you-sick/,"Food is thy medicine. but can medicine be thy food?Well yes it can. There are certain hidden ingredients labeled inactive in several over-the-counter and prescription based drugs that could be harming you and your family. The fact that they are called inactive is a detraction from what they really areanything you put in your body is active and heres the information you need to know.Let me start by telling you a personal storyA few years ago I had a crazy metallic taste develop in my mouth that I just couldnt get rid of. It goes without saying, it was annoying and very alarming to be tasting metal in my mouth on a constant basis. As a result, I went to my acupuncturist and my regular doctor looking for answers. They had me eliminate fish from my diet (because of possible mercury poisoning), had my blood checked, and they did everything possible to find out what the heck was happening. No one could figure it out even after all the tests came back.There was only one pharmaceutical drug I was taking at the time  a little blue birth control pill. To my surprise, my pharmacist made the decision to give me the generic version instead of the brand version that month. Of course my acupuncturist and doctor both asked me if I had been taking any new drugs/vitamins, etc  and my answer was no  but little did I realize at the time I was taking something totally different. Generic versions of pills can contain all sorts of additives, artificial colors and ingredients that make them chemically different from the brand version. It is a routine practice for drug companies to vary the exact combination of inactive ingredientsto avoid patent infringement on brand name drugs and to make their appearance more appealing and last longer on the shelf .Shortly, after I switched back to my brand version of birth control pills, the metallic taste in my mouth magically disappeared. (FYI  2 years ago, I decided to stop taking birth control pills because I did not like what I uncovered about them and regret taking them at all, but thats a topic for another time). Finally figuring out that the generic version of the drug was quite different than the original was ground breaking to my understanding what inactive ingredients can do to you.And thats why I decided to look into the most popular household cold and flu medicines out there and investigate the actual ingredients in them.Cold medicines like NYQUIL, Robitussin, Alka Seltzer and Triaminic have been around for decades and you, as well as your grandparents have probably used them. I still remember the taste of original orange flavored Triaminic  as my parents gave it to me every time I had a cold.The main problem with many of these drugs is that back in the day the FDA did not perform rigorous testing on them. Instead they were only required to give them a stamp of GRAS or Generally Regarded As Safe and many of the inactive ingredients were not sufficiently tested. Although new drugs are tested more thoroughly now, drugs like pseudoephedrine were often grandfathered in.Are these medicines really healing us or just putting a bandaid on symptoms that have no effect on us actually getting better?According to Dr. Bruce Barrett, a leading cold researcher at the University of Wisconsin, cough and cold drugs have an effectiveness rate of only 20% of reducing symptoms and virtually zero effectiveness in actually removing the bacteria or virus out from your system.Dr. Michael Carome, Deputy Director of the advocacy group Public Citizen, agrees. He states that these drugs have more debilitating side effects than benefit. For example, decongestants can work in reverse and cause rebound stuffiness and cardiac arrhythmia; cough syrups make you drowsy, fever reducers like acetaminophen can wreak havoc on your liver, while others can irritate your gastrointestinal system.So why do so many people still take these over-the-counter drugs?A study published in 2010 by Harvard Medical School found that placebo pills are just as effective as taking drugs when it comes to non-life-threatening chronic conditions. Which basically means our belief that something is working is sometimes all we need! The placebo effect has been documented over centuries and several natural medicine doctors believe our thoughts can be powerful healers.Additionally, when drug manufacturers createmarketing campaigns depicting quick recovery from illness after consuming their productsof families going from in-the-bed sick back to school and/or work in commercials and advertisements  our brains get hooked to the message and we believe these drugs are actually working, when all they are doing is producing side effects we could definitely live without as well as allexposing us to potentially toxic and unhealthy inactive ingredients.Most of the over-the-counter medicines you find at drug stores have several inactive ingredients that could be harming you with substances you didnt even know you were consuming. GMOsThe doctors that belong to the American Academy of Environmental Medicinecalled on All physicians to educate their patients, the medical community, and the public to avoid GM (genetically modified) foods when possible and provide educational materials concerning GM foods and health risks.If you are trying to remove GMOs from your diet  youve got to make sure to look in your medicine cabinet too. All of these over-the-counter cold and flu remedies here listed have potential ingredients that contain GMOs. Many of the ingredients are hidden sources of GMOs. (See a full list of GMO ingredients here)For example, notice the partially hydrogenated cottonseed & soy oil a.k.a. transfat in Zicam, high fructose corn syrup in NYQUIL and Robitussin, and soy lecithin in Halls cough drops.There have been no long term human studies on GMOs and preliminary studies on animals show horrific consequences.A studyshowed GMOs causedtoxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals.Anotherstudyrevealed that female rats fed GMO soy for 15 months showedsignificant health issuesin their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy.A 2009 French Study concluded that Glyphosate (used on GMO soy) cankill the cellsin the outer layer of the human placenta, theorgan that connects the mother to her fetus, providing nutrients and oxygen and emptying waste products.A Russian study conducted on hamsters that were fed GMO soy diets for two years over three generations found that by the third generation,most of the hamsters lost the ability to have babies, showed slower growth, and suffereda higher mortality rate.Chemical PreservativesSodium Benzoate and/or Benzoic Acid are cautionary preservatives found in cough syrups like Robitussin. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative increases hyperactivityin children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can form benzene,carcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Dimethylpolysiloxane is ananti-foaming agent and type of silicone used in caulks and sealants and as a filler for breast implants. Its commonly used in fried fast food items  even McDonalds new Fish McNuggets have this ingredient added to it. Its also the key ingredient insilly putty. This agent might not kill you  but do we really need to be consuming a chemical cocktail of synthetic ingredients when we are sick or at all?Artificial SugarsSaccarin (a.k.a Sweet n Low), Aspartame, Sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda), Acesulfame Potassium, etc. are all chemically derived sugars with absolutely no nutritional value at all and can be dangerous.Saccarin which is found in Robitussin and NYQUIL is one to avoid at ALL costs.The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)has reported the studies showing saccharin causes cancer in the urinary bladder, lungs, ovaries, uterus, and other organs in animals and also increases the potency of other cancer-causing chemicals.Over 10,000 complaints have been filed with the FDA on Aspartame since 1980 and has actually never been proven to be safe before it was approved for use in our food supply. It has been linked to diabetes, auto-immune disorders, depression (which can cause you to eat more  once again), birth defects, and several forms of cancer.CSPI also states Acesulfame-K or Acesulfame Potassium is anything but safe. Two rat studies suggest that the additive might cause cancer, but these studies were never addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance to also be used by in 1970. In addition, it is mentioned that large doses of acetoacetamide (a breakdown product of this sugar) have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs. This toxic sugar substitute can be found in Alka Seltzer, Triaminic and NYQUIL.Artificial ColorsCan they really call artificial dye inactive when it has been proven to causehyperactivityin children? All of these drugs  NYQUIL, Mucinex,Robitussin, Halls, Alka Seltzer, Triaminic, and Zicamhave artifical colors. These artificial colors are made in a lab with same chemicals used in petroleum productionand are consideredknown carcinogensby many consumer watch agencies. How is taking petroleum which is used in gasoline going to help your immune system long term? Why are these substances even in medicines to begin with? Arent medicines suppose to heal you?So What Do You Do The Next Time You Get A Cold/Allergies/Flu?There are a LOT of natural remedies out there that work. so I want to share the top 5 that have worked for me. Please note these remedies are just on top of my regular habits of exercise, taking probiotics, eating a plant-based diet and drinking warm water with lemon and cayenne first thing every morning that all improve my immune system and help me ward off colds as much as possible.Use A Neti Pot neti pot is aceramic pot that looks like a cross between a small teapot and Aladdins magic lamp and used to irrigate the nasal cavities and has been used for centuries! Almost immediately at the sign of a cold, I grab my netty pot, filtered water (very important that it is filtered), some salt and a little bit of baking soda and go straight into my bathroom to clean out my nasal passages. This practice usually reduces the amount of time I have a cold or immediately stops it from becoming full blown. Also, I love using it in allergy season or when Ive been around allergens in an old house with mold or around animals I am allergic to.Avoid Sugar Like the Plague  Sugar absolutely wreaks havoc on the body when you arent sick, but when you are sick and you eat sugar  you are multiplying the harmful effects further weakening the immune system and creating even more inflammation in your body. Sugar is one the key ingredients that bacteria and viruses feed off in your body, thats why if you get a cold its important to stay away from candy, cakes, ice-cream, all those types of items that are extraordinary high in sugar if you want to get better fast.Juice with Ginger and Garlic If you can stand it, add garlic and ginger root to your green juice. They both have amazing anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can get you better in no time! I havent had a cold last more than 2 days as a result of drinking green juice like this on a regular basis, especially when I have symptoms of a cold.Stay Hydrated  I avoid caffeine and drink an extraordinary amount of water based substances like hot soups, hot teas and just plain water. I dont recommend gatorade  but these alternatives instead. Also  if you have kids, try this homemade version of Pedialyte  you dont want to go anywhere near that branded hoax of a product either.Acupuncture & Chinese Herbs When I get sickI rarely go to a conventional medical doctor now  I almost always first see my Acupuncturist. A treatment is sometimes all I need to help move a virus or bacteria infection out of my system. Also  I take combination of medicinal Chinese herbs as soon as I get a sign of a cold (usually the first sign for me is a scratchy throat) and/or to lessen the severity or duration of colds. One time when I had a crazy astronomical fever, I was able to reduce it just by taking these herbs. (Please note  I am not a doctor or Chinese medicinepractitioner please do not use this information as medical advice for you personally.)My goal in sharing this information with you is not to scare you into believing this stuff will kill you (although, it likely will slowly over time), but to inspire you to look at all the chemicals that being pushed at us by the pharmaceutical and food industries. We dont need to consume these chemicals  our bodies were not made to consume them and we certaintly dont need them to feel better.If you think this post could benefit someone in your life  please share it  you could be a life saver.Wishing You The Best Health Always,Food Babe90.4K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

67,How To Detox After Vacation (or anytime!),http://foodbabe.com/2013/01/09/how-to-detox-after-vacation-or-anytime/,"No. Im not making out with my juice. This is what happens when I find juice on vacation. I cherish every ounce of goodnessThis was a mix of carrots, cucumbers, celery and sprouts.It was one of my only pure vegetables juices I had while traveling last month. I had it in Cusco, Peru, where juice was available all over the placebut we were sadly only there a few days.For the last part of last year and early part of this year  Ive been a traveling mad woman, hence the lack of juice (and I had ZERO kale. The horror.). For instance, just in the last month, Ive taken 15 different flights. Im not complaining about this at all, because the places (Lima, Cusco, Sacred Valle, Machu Picchu, Paracas, Quito, and the Galapagos Islands) I went were totally INCREDIBLE. I cant wait to share the pictures and our experiences with you but first I must get back on track.After all the travel, my body is SCREAMING for a detox, routine, normality and just to be home for a while. (My mind on the other hand has a different plan, already planning the next tripahhhh). And to be completely honest, even though Ive been following most of my healthy habits on the road (if you dont know what they are and wish to find out  subscribe here to get a list!), I havent been watching how much Ive been eating nor have I been on my regular schedule of exercise or yoga (I forgot myyoga travel mat at home  big mistake!). I find it funny, actually, that Im getting back on track during this month the month of January, when everyone and their neighbor is trying to do the same (not a bad thing, just the truth) Years past, because of my heavily plant based clean eating lifestyle, I havent really needed to lose weight or detox during this specific month (the beauty of living and eating organically!) but this year Im with the rest of the folks, trying desperately to feel as good as I did last year.These are some simple steps I take to get back on track. The best part is that you can use any of them anytime of year, not just after vacation.Drink Dandelion Tea This stuff is DYNAMITE for reducing that initial swelling or bloating after traveling. It also significantly reduces water retention after a heavily salted diet. I have found that eating out almost always guarantees salt bloat. Even after asking the waiters in South America to reduce the amount of salt in my food on several occasions, it never actually happened it perhaps got lost in translation but I didnt worry too much, because I packed dandelion tea with me and always drink it as soon as I get back home.Dandelion stimulates the liver, the primary organ that removes toxins  which is what you want after a trip being exposed to all sorts of things out of your element oh you dont know what I am talking about? Im talking about stuff like . radiation from airplanes and pesticides being sprayed on an airplane and in your food, using hotel sheets, towels, etc washed with detergents that are full of chemicals, blowing your nose and wiping your tush with fragrance filled tissue paper, drinking water from plastic bottles non stop, etc it all adds up and anything to help move those toxins out of my body the better. My favorite brand of dandelion tea is Traditional Medicinals and available hereon Amazon.Daily Wheatgrass Shots  Speaking of removing toxins, there may not be a better way to do that than drinking daily wheatgrass. I have 40 or so reasons listed hereif you dont believe meYou dont have to do a daily shot to get the benefits however, a few times a week is great too, especially after a vacation or the holidays. It is a sure fire way to help speed up your energy, your vibrance and your metabolism. Its very powerful stuff and its potency takes getting used to. I have to sike myself up every time I take a shot but by the end of it all, Im all smiles.Eat Raw Vegetables At Every Meal This might seem like a obvious way to detox but not having any kale for almost a month and trying to determine where I could eat raw vegetables safely was very limiting (most guide books say to avoid raw vegetables when traveling), making this tip very important for my detox plan on return. I didnt even have my usual daily green powders (Green VibranceorVitamineral Greens) with me on my travels either they got lost in a taxi cab in Lima early in the trip. (You are welcome Mr. Taxi Cab Driver Im sure you are feeling great after all those nutrients!) So what is the plan to get more vegetables  and raw ones at that? Its simple  just eat raw vegetables before every meal (including during breakfast), drink daily green juice or green smoothiesIll probably do all three, because I am a vegetable fanatic. Raw vegetables makes me feel AMAZING and are known for removing toxins and healing your body fast.The following daily plan works great with my schedule  a green smoothie for breakfast (FAST to make), raw veggies before my lunch (pre-cut the night before) or a large salad, and a green juice (freshly made after work or bought) before dinner. And of course my actual meals will all consist of even more vegetables to aid in the overall detoxDo a Juice Fast (but not right away)  While my body is still get used to the cold 40 degree weather, coming off of 80s in the Galapagos, Im not quite ready to dive into a juice fast just yet but will be after a week or two back in this environment and eating clean. Thats the key  the detox symptoms of a juice fast are much less severe when you have been eating healthy, mostly raw and clean for at least a week, so I dont recommend starting a fast, day one after a vacation. You definitely want to make the fasting as pleasant as possible and not painful! I will likely do one soon, stay tuned on that but if youd like to read up on one of my previous juice fasts  check out this series of posts, along with some of my favorite juice recipes:Why Juice Fast & PreppingJuice Fast Day 1Juice Fast Day 2 and Juicer TipsJuice Fast Day 3Kickin Kale JuiceRainbow Bite JuiceRavishing Red JuiceSuper Detox JuiceEat at Home  This should be like numero uno on this list. Although I pretty much ordered my food at restaurants my usual way while on vacation following my eating out tips, the amount of high calorie fat (healthy and unhealthy ones too) probably ended up in my food more than I would have liked. Also the variety of food in general wasnt always the best either for instance, there were about 7 days straight the main course for lunch and dinner consisted of fish, corn and potatoes. While those arent terrible foods and wont kill you. I dont normally eat meat more than once a day and rarely eat white potatoes or corn. I am very much looking forward to controlling the amount of oil, salt, starch, etc. in my food and eating organically as much as possible in the coming weeks to counteract all the pesticides and other potentially toxic ingredients I may have encountered.Count Calories Following all the tips above and getting back on my usual routine will likely aid in helping me lose a few pounds I might have gained during my travels but theres no better sure fire way to lose the weight than to follow this tip. When I notice my pants fitting a little snug (for the record, Ill be wearing dresses for the whole month of January, so I dont need to find out how snug they are right now), or I am feeling a bit untonedI count my calories. Most real foodists are probably rolling their eyes at this tipbut to my experience, counting calories WORKS. Its plain and simple  calories in vs. calories out helps you lose weight. Good for you foods can be higher in calories(think avocado, walnuts, coconut oil) and if you eat them freely, not portioned control, its easy to pack on weight especially when they are easier to find and eat on vacation.Of course, if you havent been following a clean chemical-free and organic lifestyle  choosing a diet consisting of whole real plant based food is the first step to feeling great and naturally losing weight but for the folks that have a clean organic lifestyle down pat  calorie counting is the next step to getting the optimal body you want.I like to count calories before a trip and after, because during is no fun! If I count calories before, it gives me a little buffer to indulge on vacation with higher calorie food and of course, counting calories after a trip gets me back where I feel my best.I like to use a BMR Calculator to find out my basal metabolic rate (BMR) and determine the number of calories it takes for me to sustain my weight. For my height and weight  its always around 1300. This means I can consume around 1300 calories every single day and not do a lick of activity and not gain weight. So what I usually do is exercise by burning anywhere between 400-600 calories a day to create a calorie deficit (I use my Polar Heart Rate Monitor to track this) and eat a total 1300-1500 calories a day until I get back down to where I feel great (FYI  this is where my skinny jeans fit nicely). Then I slowly increase my calories to roughly 1800-2000 when I dont need to lose weight. Now, about 80% of the year I dont count calories, because I am in the zone, wearing my skinny jeans, following my habits, not traveling like a crazy person, having a good routine of juicing and smoothies, etc. But when I do count calories, I use an app on my iPhone for that. A food journal works great too. Its totally up to you but the app has helped me get results 100% of the time, because it is so easy to keep up with and I dont have to do the math. I know my body takes about a month to lose 3-4 pounds (there are 3500 calories in a pound), so by March (my birthday month), I know I will be back where I need to be (i.e. feeling good in my skinny jeans  yeah!).Doing yoga with one my best friends in the sand dunes of Huacachina, PeruHot Yoga Now I really believe that 80% of detoxing is what you put in your body but I dont want to discount how hot yoga has helped me detox my body from the inside out. When I do yoga, focusing on my breathing and the postures, it completely eliminates my stress and makes me happy and so energetic. There is no other activity that gives me more pleasure and peace of mind. And its because the yoga poses are designed to hit and bring energy to every organ in the body  improving your digestion, circulation and brain. Practicing in a hot room, allows you to get deeper into the poses (stimulating all the organs that help with detoxing more effectively) and releases some toxins via sweat. There are lot of people that have tried to disprove that toxins are released through sweat  but I dont believe their research or theories at all. I know from my own experience that it works. For example  when I know I havent been eating right or exposed to some element that is harmful or not good for my body, my skin will literally sting after sweating, but if Im practicing clean living, my sweat will not do this to my skin.

68,What to Watch out for at Whole Foods,http://foodbabe.com/2012/10/01/what-to-watch-out-for-at-whole-foods/,"If I could give one piece of health advice to everyone I meet Id ask them to shop in a place where they can get the best quality groceries and produce available. Changing where I shop has been fundamental in changing my health for the better.However, going to the grocery store  even natural ones  can be really daunting, especially if you are trying to avoid processed foods. Whole Foods Market stores, known for their organic and natural options, are popping up everywherewe even got one here in my hometown just last month. People inherently trust Whole Foods because their marketing is almost spotless. Whole Foods emotionalizes the shopping experience with visions of abundant good-for-you-eats the moment you walk in the store. They greet you with an array of fresh flowers that immediately invokes a state of freshness, and the high quality standards are touted to easily make anyone believe they are shopping at the best place possible.Whole Foods has a laundry list of chemicals, preservatives and additives they do not allow in their stores that should alleviate most of your worries  an unacceptable list of ingredients that I highly endorse and wish every grocery store followed (albeit, its missing a couple of items). Typical wholesalers and conventional supermarkets are stocked with so many questionable chemicals and ingredients it makes my head spin. This is why Ive pretty much stopped going to conventional grocery stores all together  its just too exhausting to have to avoid all the chemical additives they let into their stores and to have to constantly scrutinize their ingredients.Whole Foods is far superior to conventional grocery stores in terms of what they dont allow in their stores, however I uncovered some facts that will shock even the most savvy consumer.Okay, so back to Whole Foods and what you need to look out for:1. Not Everything is Organic Dont let the fact that they are a certified organic grocery store fool you. Being CCOF certified means practically nothing in terms of how much organic produce they actually have to sell you. Ive been to Whole Foods many times now, and I havent been able to find all of the organic produce I want  most of it is conventional and often flown in from other countries. For instance, I use cucumbers in one of my favorite smoothie recipes right now, and on the last three trips to Whole Foods, organic cucumbers were not available along with several other of my staples I buy on a weekly basis. Buying organic vegetables like cucumbers is very important because they are included in the dirty dozen list  a list of fruits and vegetables that are recommended to purchased only organic because of the high level of pesticide residue found in them. Remember that increased exposure to pesticides are in some cases linked to birth defects, nerve damage, and cancer. The Presidents Cancer Panel has urged us to avoid food sprayed with pesticides and doesnt believe any amount is safe.Chart from Environmental Working GroupI sometimes go to Whole Foods for a quick meal, but its not very often because the prepared foods and salad bar are mostly conventional, too. Its very hard to find an organic meal available at any of their food stations  pizza, deli, sushi, soup, salad, sandwiches, smoothies, etc. Since Im already at the store in the first place, I usually talk myself into buying the organic ingredients I need and preparing them at home rather than making a habit of eating there. On several occasions, Ive found less than stellar ingredients hidden in their prepared foods  like GMOs, hidden MSG and the over use of cheap oils like corn, soy, and canola, which I will get to in a minute.2. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are Everywhere If there was one thing I thought I could avoid by shopping at Whole Foods, it would at least be GMOs, especially looking at their quality standards. When you ask the staff about GMOs, like I did just the other day, they will tell you all sorts of different answers on the topic. The inconsistencies in their communications to customers was just recently exposed in an Organic Spies tell-all-video, that used hidden cameras to ask Whole Foods employees about GMOs in their stores. This video uncovered that most employees said there were no GMOs at Whole Foods, however in actuality approximately 20  30% of their stores goods contain GMOs. When I specifically asked the team leader of my store in Charlotte if I could have a list of all the non-GMO products, he said there are absolutely no GMOs in here, we dont have a list. He was so pompous about his answer, that I followed up his bold statements with a couple of questions that were not answered correctly. I did not want to argue with him, so instead, I took pictures of the Kashi, Pirate Booty, Barbaras Bakery, etc. on their shelves  all brands Ive researched that have GMOs.As I explained in my Chipotle Investigation, GMOs were not studied for their safety on humans before they were approved by the FDA, and they do not require labeling in the United States. A recent French Study revealed that rats fed GMOs during the course of their lifetime and exposed to the pesticide Round Up developed tumors all over their bodies and in their internal organs. There has been so much outrage about the alarming results that Russia just last week banned all GMO Corn imports into their country and Europe is considering banning them too.Whole Foods sources non-GMO ingredients for their 365 store brand and supports GMO-labeling in California, where the issue will appear on the ballot as Proposition 37 in November. However, Whole Foods hasnt donated a single cent to the campaign  a large percentage (~$2-3 billion dollars) of their profits are directly tied to the sale of GMOs after all. Their support is superficial at best and a company that makes over $10 billion dollars in revenue should put their money where their mouth is, especially since big food corporations are outspending the effort to label GMOs 11 to 1. Whole Foods has stated they havent donated because they do not contribute to political campaigns. Our right to know is not political  its a basic fundamental human right to know what we are eating. Safeguarding our organic farm land starts with labeling and eliminating GMOs  this is something Whole Foods could have a major impact in protecting and should be committed to, especially wearing the label of a CCOF certified organic grocer.The Non-GMO project and the Institute of Responsible Technology are two resources that provide non-GMO shopping lists. Also check out a list of my favorite organic snack substitutes for popular conventional GMO snacks.3. Hidden Ingredients I know I am preaching to the choir when I say this, but reading the ingredients on everything you buy is still critical, even when you are shopping in Whole Foods! Considering the laundry list of unacceptable ingredients Whole Foods does not allow in their stores  I find it appalling that they still allow brands they carry to use rBGH (a.k.a. recombinant bovine growth hormone) in their dairy products. rBGH has been outlawed in 27 countries and study after study links this genetically modified ingredient to many forms of cancers. It is risky buying conventional dairy products from Whole Foods- buy only organic, 365 brand, or other brands explicitly labeled rBGH free.Additionally, Whole Foods list of unacceptable ingredients does not include propylene glycol, caramel color, carrageenan and several forms of hidden MSG  ingredients that would make logical sense to ban from their stores.Carrageenan is used as a stabilizer in dairy and non-dairy like products and consumption is linked to gastrointestinal disorders. 365 brand cottage cheese, soy milk, flax milk and rice milk all contain carrageenan. You also can find it all over the store in different brands of ice cream, sour cream, etc. (Cornucopia Institute created a helpful shopping guide to help you avoid this additive.)I found yeast extract, a common hidden name for MSG, in soups, sushi, seasonings and in many packaged goods. The amount of MSG that can end up in your food is not regulated by the FDA, but Whole Foods consciously allows it throughout their store. MSG is also likely genetically modified and can be listed under several different names. MSG is an excitotoxin that, in some cases, can excite brain cells to death and cause adverse reactions in some people including skin rashes, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, asthma, heart irregularities, depression and even seizures. This list of hidden MSG names is helpful in understanding the various names for MSG so you can look for it on the label and avoid it.Many of Whole Foods prepared foods contain cheap acidic oils  like corn oil seen in this Borscht soup below. This is something I pay a great deal of attention to, because so many processed foods are using these highly refined oils (which are likely genetically modified too) and creating an imbalance of Omega 6 to Omega 3 fatty acids in our bodies. Furthermore, experts are so emphatic about the unhealthy nature of oils like corn, soy, and canola, they recommend discontinuing all use and throwing them in the trash. Switching to unrefined coconut, olive and sesame oils could drastically improve Whole Foods prepared foods and send a loud message that they are putting the health of their customers before their profits.4. High Prices Im sure youve heard the joke that when you shop at Whole Foods you can end up spending your whole pay check! This joke may not be far from truth based on the total cost of some common grocery staples.Prices turned out to only be slightly higher at Whole Foods (depending on what you are buying) when compared to one of their local competitors, Earth Fare. Luckily, you can find many of these items cheaper elsewhere, but it just takes a little effort. I like to keep shopping costs down by buying staples in bulk on the internet, going directly to local farms and visiting farmers markets.In Summary As you can see  Whole Foods may not have all your best interests in mind. Whole Foods has a tremendous opportunity to make a historical impact on our food policy  if they do the right thing. We could all easily find non-organic products, GMOs, and other unwanted ingredients at the rest of Americas supermarkets so lets just hope a store like Whole Foods will lead the way and eventually eliminate these items all together.Im cautiously still a customer because obtaining organic groceries is hard enough as it is; limiting my store choices even more would be silly. Whole Foods, Earth Fare, and other grocery stores that have eliminated laundry lists of chemicals and additives will always be better than conventional grocery stores. I am thankful they make shopping for healthier alternatives much more convenient. Besides, my husband loves having a local craft beer at Whole Foods while I shop  getting him to the grocery store with me is an absolute miracle that Im just not willing to give up!2906@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

69,How Food Companies Exploit Americans with Ingredients Banned in Other Countries,http://foodbabe.com/2013/02/12/how-food-companies-exploit-americans-with-ingredients-banned-in-other-countries/,"Thoughts of outrage, unfairness, disbelief, and ultimately grief consumed me while I was doing this investigation. A list of ingredients that are banned across the globe but still allowed for use here in the American food supply recently made news. While I have written about some of those ingredients before, this list inspired me to look a little deeper and find out how pervasive this issue is for us. Could these banned ingredients be contributing to the higher mortality and disease rates here in the U.S.?The health of Americans is downright grim according to a report just released by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council. It declares Americans are sicker and die younger than other people in wealthy nations. The United States spends 2.5 times more on health care than any other nation, however, when compared with 16 other nations we come in dead last in terms of health and life expectancy for men and near the bottom for women.Here is the breakdown for you:More than two thirds of United States citizens are overweight  33% being obese.32% of children are either obese or overweight.43% of Americans are projected to be obese in 10 years.After smoking, obesity is Americas biggest cause of premature death and is linked to 70% of heart disease and 80% of diabetes cases.And 41% of Americans are projected to get cancer in their lifetime!These reports and statistics scream the word HELP! Recently, I spent some time down in Mississippi volunteering in the most obese county in the nation. I found that while social and economic factors do play a part in this epidemic, the main culprit was the lack of nutrition education. The victims of obesity are likely the same victims of systematic brainwashing from Big Food marketers, relying on diet soda, low fat products, or looking only at calories on product labels. Basically, they are doing what the food industry has been teaching them about losing weight versus finding out the truth about real food.And thats the problem  the food industry is the one leading our conversation in this country about food and nutrition, educating the mass public about what to eat and what not to eat. Coca-Cola recently even went as far as creating a special campaign to combat obesity  yes you read that right  a sugar filled soda company trying to stop obesity. (You can read my reaction to that here).Unfortunately, the doctors in this country are not exactly leading the discussion either, since nutrition is not currently a focus in medical school. And the government has their hands tied by big food industry and chemical company lobbyists that basically control what the FDA approves, deems safe for human consumption, and our overall food policy. So who is going to finally tell us the truth about our food?The food industry does not want us to pay attention to the ingredients nor do they care about the negative effects from eating them. They certainly dont care about the astronomical medical bills that are a direct result of us eating the inferior food they are creating.The HELP we need starts here. We as a collective nation must stop this trajectory of sickness and rising health care costs, by understanding the ingredients we are putting into our bodies. We must challenge the U.S. food industry to discontinue the use of banned ingredients that are not allowed elsewhere in the world. We deserve to have the same quality food without potential toxins.Food is medicine, and plain and simple, if our food is sick (filled with GMOs, chemicals, additives, artificial ingredients, and/or carcinogens), collectively we as a country are going to continue to be sick.Using banned ingredients that other countries have determined unsafe for human consumption has become a pandemic in this country. To prove this point, I found the best and easiest place to look for evidence was just across the pond in the United Kingdom, where they enjoy some of the same types of products we do  but with totally different ingredient lists. It is appalling to witness the examples I am about to share with you. The U.S. food corporations are unnecessarily feeding us chemicals  while leaving out almost all questionable ingredients in our friends products overseas. The point is the food industry has already formulated safer, better products, but they are voluntarily only selling inferior versions of these products here in America. The evidence of this runs the gamut from fast food places to boxed cake mix to cereal to candy and even oatmeal  you cant escape it.Some of the key American brands that are participating in this deception are McDonalds, Pringles (owned by Kelloggs), Pizza Hut and Quaker (owned by Pepsi), Betty Crocker (owned by General Mills), Starburst (owned by M&M/Mars), and Ritz Crackers (owned by Kraft). In the examples below, red text indicates potentially harmful ingredients and/or ingredients likely to contain GMOs.Having a pre-made box of flour, baking soda and sugar all ready to go saves time for some people when it comes to making a cake, but does saving time have to come at the expense of chemically derived and potentially toxic ingredients? The United States version of Betty Crocker Red Velvet cake not only has artificial colors linked to hyperactivity in children, food cravings, and obesity, but it also has partially hydrogenated oils (a.k.a. trans fat). Trans fat has been shown to be deadly even in small amounts. Previous trials have linked even a 40-calorie-per-day increase in trans fat intake to a 23% higher risk of heart disease. This could easily be the amount of trans fat in one serving of Betty Crocker icing alone.Sodium benzoate is an ingredient that Coca-Cola actually removed in their Diet Coke product overseas, but youll still find it in their product Sprite, cake mixes and loads of other products across the USA. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative increases hyperactivity in children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can form benzene, a carcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Fast Food giants like McDonalds and Pizza Hut are just as guilty as General Mills Betty Crocker. Look closely at the ingredients in McDonalds french fries above. Do you see how the french fries in the U.K. version are basically just potatoes, vegetable oil, a little sugar and salt? How can McDonalds make french fries with such an uncomplicated list of ingredients all over Europe, but not over here? Why do McDonalds french fries in the U.S. have to have TBHQ, trans fat and anti-foaming agents? Correct me if Im wrong, but the last time I checked  I didnt think Americans liked foam with their fries either! The anti-foaming agent  dimethylpolysiloxane  is a type of silicone used in caulks and sealants and as a filler for breast implants. Its also the key ingredient in silly putty. Thanks FDA for allowing companies to put silly putty in our french fries. Seriously  this is out of control. McDonalds Strawberry Sauce in the United States includes high fructose corn syrup, red #40 and sodium benzoate, while the citizens of the U.K. get off scot-free. Instead, they get 37% real strawberries in their product and no additional flavoring or harmful preservatives.Pizza Hut does a huge disservice to us (and their workers) by using Azodicarbonamide in their garlic cheese bread. This ingredient is banned as a food additive in the U.K., Europe, and Australia, and if you get caught using it in Singapore you can get up to 15 years in prison and be fined $450,000. The U.K. has recognized this ingredient as a potential cause of asthma if inhaled, and advises against its use in people who have sensitivity to food dye allergies and other common allergies in food, because azodicarbonamide can exacerbate the symptoms. However, Pizza Hut and many other fast food chains like Subway and Starbucks use this ingredient in their U.S. bread products.Natural and artificial flavors and hidden MSG (in the form of autolyzed yeast extract, in this case) are commonly found throughout products in America but not elsewhere. Junk food companies intentionally add this combination of ingredients to create sensory overload by exciting your brain cells to remember the food you are eating and make less nutritious ingredients taste better to you. Im not saying that the food industry has completely eliminated these same tricks abroad  but when you look at the U.K. version of garlic cheese bread, the ingredients look pretty basic. Many of the ingredients you could use at home to make garlic bread. Ive never found TBHQ in the baking aisle at the grocery store, have you? TBHQ, by the way, is a preservative derived from petroleum and used in perfumes, resins, varnishes and oil field chemicals. Laboratory studies have linked TBHQ to stomach tumors. This preservative is also used by Chick-Fil-A  in their famous chicken sandwiches.Reviewing the ingredients in Pringles really got me worked up ever wonder why you cant stop eating chips after having just one? MSG is the culprit  and in the U.S. version of Pringles, its added twice! Once in its known name and again in a hidden source, called yeast extract.This begs the question Why are Americans so addicted to processed food?! The food industry has designed it that way on purpose to line their pockets with profits, at the expense of our health.The U.K. Ritz Crackers ingredient list resembles items that youd find in every household around the country  but the United States version goes the extra mile to include trans fat, HFCS and natural flavor. Natural flavor can be also be a hidden form of MSG, which, again, is an additive that will likely make you eat more than you would otherwise.In the United States, Quaker Oats has several different flavors of oatmeal that contain different fruit flavored, artificially dyed pieces of dehydrated apple but that dont actually contain any of the fruit shown on the package. But in the U.K.  they dont even attempt to sell that garbage. They instead have a product called Oats so Simple that actually has REAL strawberries in it  light years ahead of our version that includes trans fat, artificial food coloring, and artificial flavors.Theres only one difference in Rice Krispies between the U.S. and U.K. version  but its a big difference. Its one ingredient that is banned virtually in every other country, except here in the United States. That ingredient is called BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) or BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and is a very common preservative used rampantly throughout packaged food in the U.S.Test studies published by the IPCS (International Program for Chemical Safety) show tissue inflammation, enlargement, and/or growths in 100%, and cancer in 35% of [animal] subjects as reported in this article. How can the U.S. allow this chemical in our food  much less in cereal aimed and targeted at our kids?And speaking of targeting our kids  food companies have found a way to naturally color candy all over Europe, but our candy here is still full of artificial substances made from petroleum and GMO sugar. Looking at the ingredients in Starburst Fruit Chews provides a great example of this disgrace.I saved the most startling fact for last. One very cautionary set of ingredients that are included in almost all of the American products but not the U.K. products are GMOs, in the form of either corn or soy.There have been no long term human studies on GMOs and preliminary studies on animals show horrific consequences. For instance, a study showed GMOs caused toxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals. Another study revealed that female rats fed GMO soy for 15 months showed significant health issues in their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy. A 2009 French Study concluded that Glyphosate (used on GMO soy) can kill the cells in the outer layer of the human placenta, the organ that connects the mother to her fetus, providing nutrients and oxygen and emptying waste products. A Russian study conducted on hamsters that were fed GMO soy diets for two years over three generations found that by the third generation, most of the hamsters lost the ability to have babies, showed slower growth, and suffered a higher mortality rate.In the U.K. food companies are required by law to list if a certain ingredient is derived from a genetically modified or genetically engineered material on the label. Out of all the products I researched, I couldnt find one product with this label. (See example from GMO-Compass and BBC above of what it would look like if I did.)This was very telling considering that not only have food companies taken out all sorts of hazardous chemical ingredients abroad  but they also have willingly reformulated their products without GMOs.Food corporations in the U.S. claim reformulating their products to remove harmful ingredients or changing labels would be too expensive  but theyve already done just that in Europe and in many other countries. Their governments listened to the outrage of their people and took the safety of their citizens health above everything else. Is it too much to ask the same for us in the United States of America? How much do our sickness, obesity, and mortality rates have to worsen before they respond to us?I will leave you with this note: is and I are very disturbed about the shameful hypocrisy allowed to happen with our food supply here in the U.S. In fact we are feeling very compelled to do something about it. Stay tuned, because we are going to need every one of you to help when we are ready.

70,Chipotle vs. Moe’s – What’s Really In That Food?,http://foodbabe.com/2012/08/14/chipotle-vs-moes-what-really-in-that-food/,"3/22 Update: Chipotle responded and agreed to release ingredients online in response to petition started after this blog post. Check out the latest and whats safe to eat at Chipotle hereand a news report here.Before I get into the meat of this next investigation (no pun intended), Id like to express my disappointment with Chipotle and Moes. Both of them made it extremely difficult (just like Yoforia) to get the exact ingredients in their product offerings. With marketing phrases like Food with Integrity and Feed the Moement  youd think their messages would easily be backed by ingredients they would be willing to share. Unfortunately, this is not the case at all and it took extreme perseverance to get quality information about their ingredients. Perseverance the average consumer would likely never have.Its saddening to watch two competitors leading the way in organic/local/healthy fast food offerings being so secretive. If they were true leaders, they would have nothing to hide, right? Im not saying Subway, Panera Breadand McDonalds are better than Chipotle or Moes  but you do have to hand it to them for willingly posting their ingredients for everyone to see.When I emailed Chipotle asking for the ingredients in certain products they downright refused. They in turn asked if I was concerned about a specific ingredient or had an allergy. Really? Why do I have to be concerned about a specific ingredient or have an allergy to want to know what I am eating and whats in my food? When I tried to call them, there was no way for me to leave a message or get a person on the phone to answer my questions. Email responses were S-L-O-W. I had to ask very specific questions to get the data I needed to write this  specific questions that most consumers would likely not ask. Thank goodness for the genuinely accommodating employee who shared some of the ingredients with me (behind his Managers back) so I could give you the full story.I had to call the headquarters of Moes every single day for 8 days, visit 2 different Moes, and call 5 different locations in different states to finally get the full story. Moes company does not provide their stores with an ingredient list of what they are serving, only an allergy info guide. Since the stores throw out the labeled boxes as soon as the food packages comes in, you would have no hope in knowing exactly what you are eating unless you call the headquarters and badger them until they finally concede.I can only assume Chipotle and Moes are betting that youll give up and continue to be acquiesced with their marketing messages that in many cases are misleading and in some cases inaccurate. Now that you know what it took to get this information, lets take a look at the results of the investigation.Both restaurants use cheap genetically modified (a.k.a. GMO)soybean oil to make most of their food. Over-consumption of this cheap oilis causing an imbalance of Omega 6 fatty acids, which increases the risk of inflammation, heart disease, obesity, and prostate and bone cancer.Chipotle and Moes both pride themselves that your meal can be customized, but when I asked if they could make my food without GMO oils, they couldnt. The chicken, beef, rice, beans and the tortillas (flour, corn and soft) are all not customizable, so you have no choice but to consume GMOs if you order these items. If you are a regular consumer of Chipotle and Moes because of their local, organic and healthy messages, you also need to be concerned about consuming GMOs. Heres why:Over 50 countries have significant restrictions or outright bans on GMOs, but here in the United States the FDA continues to not require safety standards or testing on GMOs. To date, there has been no long term study conducted for humans.The Institute of Responsible Technology reported a studyshowing GMOs causedtoxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals.After consuming GMOs, your intestines basically turn into a breeding ground for pesticides (heres a videoexplaining further). GMO soy and corn actually produce pesticides inside themselves. The plant becomes toxic inside so insects wont eat it.A studyconducted and published in the Anatomical Record revealed that female rats fed GMO soy for 15 months showed significant health issuesin their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy.A 2009 French Study concluded the key ingredient in GMO soy can kill the cellsin the outer layer of the human placenta, theorgan that connects the mother to her fetus, providing nutrients and oxygen and emptying waste products.A Russian study conducted on hamsters that were fed GMO soy diets for two years over three generation found that by the third generation,most of the hamsters lost the ability to have babies, showed slower growth, and suffered a higher mortality rate.Fertility issues in males were also observed when a study on male rabbits found a decrease in sexual activity and sperm concentrationand an increase in dead or abnormal sperm when they were fed GM soy.Please note  Since neither Chiptoles or Moes carries 100% Organic USDA certified label meat, the animals were all likely raised with GMO feed, which does get transferred to us when we consume it.I could really go on and on forever listing out the different studies about the potential health consequences and why you should be concerned about consuming GMOs. I would also like to note that you will likely encounter GMOs at any restaurant (or with any processed, packaged foods) unless it is 100% organic. If you want to learn even more  This PDFfrom the Institute of Responsible Technology is a great reference. And if you live in California  you must vote Yes to Prop 37this November to label GMOs. The outcome will likely affect all of us. So what else did I find? Heres a closer look at some of my other discoveries:Moes Grass-Fed Steak  This is where Moes really messes up. And it wouldnt be a stretch to say their No MSG label on their marketing is a big fat lie. They lace their prized grass-fed meat with 3 hidden sources of MSG  hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed corn and hydrolyzed yeast.The amount of MSG that restaurants can put in your food isnot regulated.MSG is an excitotoxin that if given in large enough doses canexcite brain cells to death.MSGcan cause adverse reactions in some people including skin rashes, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, asthma, heart irregularities, depression and even seizures.Moes Ground Beef Not organic, likely contains hormones and antibiotics, contains chemical preservatives and sweetened with corn syrup. I didnt know ground beef needed to be sweetened, yuck.Chipotles Pork Carnitas The only meat available to be made without GMO soybean oil.Chipotles & Moes Flour Tortillas  Made with enriched white flour and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (a.k.a. trans fat). Previous trials have linked even a 40-calorie-per-day increase in trans fat intake to a 23% higher risk of heart disease. 40 calories is a mere 2% of a typical 2000 calorie per day diet. Trans fats can be deadly even in a small amount and as you can see will easily add up if you go over one serving size.Chipotles Corn Tacos (soft or hard) Containspreservatives andcellulose thats made from wood pulp.Cellulose is used as filler to processed foods because it doesnt contain calories or fat content and is cheap. Your body simply cannot use this ingredient at all nutritionally and lacks the enzymes to digest it. The thought of a company adding a cheap filler to my food to boost profits just doesnt sit well with me, and tortillas are easily made without it.Moes Whole Grain Tortilla  Contains many preservatives and colored with a potential carcinogen (caramel coloring) proven to causeliver tumors, lung tumors, and thyroid tumorsin rats and mice.Chipotles Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa, Tomatoes and Cilantro These are the only two guaranteed items at Chipotle that are GMO free.Moes El Guapo Salsa  Also colored with questionable caramel coloring. WOW. Why did they add color to the salsa? Because Moes salsa is a highly processed product that is mainly tomato concentrate, not real chopped tomatoes.Chipotles Cheese  Isnow 100% antibiotic and growth hormone free  but only 65% pastured raised.Moes Queso  Processed cheese product that is not from naturally raised animals. Contains propylene glycol, apetroleum based chemical food additive. Its the same stuff you can find in antifreeze, and it has been reported that the following symptoms can arise after repeated small doses  throat irritation, headache, backache, and kidney problems.Some Good News  Moes and Chipotle do not use microwaves nuking food to death or allowing it to sit out cold and be reheated again and again.VERDICT: Clearly, based on the overly processed nature of Moes products, Chipotle is the lesser of two evils, especially if you just stick to a salad with guacamole and salsa. For me  I am tired of always having to choose between the lesser of two evils and its going to be hard to support or trust either establishment until they man up and post their ingredients.If you are wondering how Im going to satisfy my burrito craving until then, check out a ridiculously fast 100% organic, non-GMO, and additive free recipe here.XOXO,Food Babe25.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!
