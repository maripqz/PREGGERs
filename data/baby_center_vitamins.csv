Vitamin A in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-a-in-your-pregnancy-diet_675.bc,"Why you need vitamin A during pregnancyVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that's stored in the liver. Vitamin A is important for your baby's embryonic growth, including the development of the heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and bones as well as the circulatory, respiratory, and central nervous systems.Vitamin A is particularly essential for women who are about to give birth because it helps with postpartum tissue repair. It also helps maintain normal vision, fights infections, supports your immune system, and helps with fat metabolism.Understanding vitamin AThere are two types of the nutrient: preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids. Preformed vitamin A (also called retinol) is used directly by the body and is found in animal products like eggs, milk, and liver. Provitamin A carotenoids are found in fruits and vegetables, but your body must convert this type into retinol.More than 600 carotenoids are found in nature, but only a few can be converted to retinol. Beta-carotene is the most common one.The standard of measurement for vitamin A is RAE (retinol activity equivalents), which is based on the potency and source of vitamin A. One microgram (mcg) of retinol (preformed vitamin A) is equal to 1 mcg RAE, but it takes 12 mcg of beta-carotene or 24 mcg of alpha-carotene to equal 1 mcg RAE.An older standard of measurement that is still used (especially on Supplement Facts labels) is the International Unit, or IU. IUs aren't easily converted to RAE because the conversion depends on the type of vitamin A. For example, 900 mcg RAE could be anywhere from 6,000 to 36,100 IU of vitamin A.How much vitamin A you needPregnant women age 18 and younger: 750 mcg RAE per dayPregnant women age 19 and older: 770 micrograms RAE per dayBreastfeeding women age 18 and younger: 1,200 mcg RAE per dayBreastfeeding women age 19 and older: 1,300 mcg RAE per dayNonpregnant women: 700 mcg RAE per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of vitamin A every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week. Can you get too much vitamin A?The average American diet provides plenty of vitamin A. It's available in meat, dairy, fish, eggs, and fortified cereals in the form of preformed vitamin A, or retinol. It's also in most fruits and vegetables, mostly in the form of carotenoids.During pregnancy, it's important not to get too much preformed vitamin A, which can cause birth defects and liver toxicity in high doses. (However, you can get as many carotenoids as you want from fruits and vegetables.)Women age 19 and older  whether or not they're pregnant or breastfeeding  should get no more than 3,000 mcg RAE (or 10,000 IU) of preformed vitamin A from supplements, animal sources, and fortified foods each day. For women age 18 and younger, the upper intake limit is 2,800 mcg RAE (9,333 IU).This is one important reason why it's not a good idea to double up on your prenatal vitamins or take any supplements that your practitioner doesn't recommend. Most prenatal vitamins contain at least part of their vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene, but some over-the-counter brands, other kinds of multivitamins, and some fortified foods contain significant amounts of preformed vitamin A. Always check a product's label or show all supplements to your practitioner before taking them.One more thing: The risk of birth defects from getting too much vitamin A is the reason that pregnant women and those trying to conceive should stay away from the prescription acne drug isotretinoin (also known by the brand nameAccutane, among others) and other drugs related to retinol (a compound of vitamin A), including topical tretinoin (Retin-A), which is used for skin conditions.Food sources of vitamin AFruits and vegetables(particularly orange and yellow ones and leafy greens), rich in beta-carotene, are the best sources of vitamin A. You're also likely to get a fair amount of preformed vitamin A from fortified milk and cereals.Liver (from beef, veal, or chicken, for example, and including pts and liverwurst) contains the highest amounts of preformed vitamin A  so much that you should limit it to once or twice a month during pregnancy to be sure that you don't get too much at once. A 3-ounce serving of beef liver can contain more than eight times the recommended daily amount of vitamin A during pregnancy  more than twice the amount that's safe to consume in one day!Here are some good food sources of vitamin A:one medium baked sweet potato: 961 mcg RAE (19,218 IU)1/2 cup canned pumpkin: 953 mcg RAE (19,065 IU)1/2 cup butternut squash, cooked: 572 mcg RAE (11,434 IU)1/2 cup canned sweet potato, mashed: 555 mcg RAE (11,091 IU)1/2 cup raw carrot, chopped: 534 mcg RAE (10,692 IU)1/2 cup spinach, cooked: 472 mcg RAE (9,433 IU)1/2 medium cantaloupe: 466 mcg RAE (9,334 IU)1/2 cup kale, cooked: 443 mcg RAE (8,854 IU)1/2 cup collard greens, cooked: 361 mcg RAE (7,220 IU)1 ounce fortified oat cereal: 215 mcg RAE (721 IU)one mango: 181 mcg RAE (3,636 IU)8 ounces nonfat milk (vitamin A added): 149 mcg RAE (500 IU)8 ounces 2% fat milk (vitamin A added): 134 mcg RAE (464 IU)8 ounces whole milk: 110 mcg RAE (395 IU)1 tablespoon butter: 95 mcg RAE (355 IU)one large egg: 80 mcg RAE (270 IU)1/2 cup cooked broccoli: 60 mcg RAE (1,207 IU)Both processing (like chopping, grating, or juicing) and cooking food make provitamin A carotenoids easier for your body to absorb. You'll also absorb more if you eat a small amount of fat (about a teaspoon) at the same time.Should you take a vitamin A supplement?Probably not. Most people get plenty of vitamin A from their diet, and prenatal vitamins also usually contain vitamin A. Read the label on yours to make sure that you're not getting more than the recommended amount, and that it's not all the preformed version.If you think you need a vitamin A supplement, or if you have questions about the vitamin A in your prenatal supplement, ask your healthcare provider for guidance.Signs of a vitamin A deficiencyBecause it's easy to get enough vitamin A from your diet, Vitamin A deficiencies in the United States are rare, except as a result of some medical conditions. Signs of a deficiency include impaired night vision and a weakened immune system. People who are deficient may also develop a condition calledxerophthalmia, which results in a cornea that becomes dry and thick.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014. Vitamin A.

Vitamin A in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-a-in-your-childs-diet_10324693.bc,"Vitamin A is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin A your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin A is importantVitamin A plays an important role in vision and bone growth and helps protect the body from infections. Vitamin A also promotes the health and growth of cells and tissues in the body, particularly those in the hair, nails, and skin.How much vitamin A does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 1,000 international units (IU), or 300 micrograms (mcg) retinol activity equivalents (RAE), of vitamin A per dayAge 4 years and up: 1,333 IU, or 400 mcg RAE per dayYour child doesn't have to get enough vitamin A every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin AColorful fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamin A. Here are some of the best sources:1/2 cup carrot juice: 22,567 IU1/4 cup cooked sweet potato: 12,907 IUone raw carrot (7 1/2 inches): 8,666 IU1/4 cup cooked carrots: 6,709 IU1/4 cup cooked spinach: 5,729 IU1/4 cup butternut squash: 5,717 IU1/4 cup cooked kale: 4,979 IU1/2 cup canned vegetable soup: 2,910 IU1/4 cup cantaloupe: 1,352 IU1/4 cup apricots, packed in juice: 1,031 IU1/4 cup red bell pepper: 720 IU1/4 cup raw spinach: 703 IU1/4 cup sliced mango: 631 IU1/2 cup fortified instant oatmeal, prepared with water: 626 IU1/4 cup cooked broccoli: 603 IU1/4 cup cooked frozen peas: 525 IU1/2 cup tomato juice: 546 IU1/2 cup fortified milk: 250 IU1/4 cup canned peaches, packed in juice: 236 IU1/2 large egg, scrambled: 160 IU1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 142 IU1/4 cup green bell pepper: 137 IU1/4 cup fresh peaches: 125 IU1/4 cup papaya: 83 IUThe amount of vitamin A in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or vegetable.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin A?Yes. Normally, the body has to convert vitamin A from its inactive form to its active form, so the body can use it. Usually an excess of vitamin A is from taking supplements that already contain high levels of the active form of the vitamin.It's also possible to get too much of the active form of vitamin A from animal sources, like liver and milk. For example, beef liver contains 21,566 IU per slice.By contrast, it's nearly impossible to overdose by getting an abundance of carotenoids, the orange and yellow pigments in carrots and other vegetables and fruits. When you eat vitamin A from these nonanimal sources, the body converts only what it needs from carotenoids to the active form of vitamin A. What will most likely happen if you go on a carrot binge is that your skin will turn yellow-orange (and that effect disappears once you go back to eating a balanced diet).How much vitamin A is too much?Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 2,000 IU (600 mcg RAE) a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 3,000 IU (900 mcg RAE).Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Don't give your child a vitamin supplement that contains more than the recommended amounts of vitamin A that your child needs every day.Too much of the active form of vitamin A can cause nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and lack of muscle coordination. Long-term effects include osteoporosis, liver problems, and disorders of the central nervous system.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for children"
The lowdown on children's vitamins,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-lowdown-on-childrens-vitamins_64355.bc,"Should I give my child a vitamin supplement?Experts disagree about whether a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement is necessary for all children. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), advises giving your child a supplement only if your child's doctor recommends one. The AAP claims most children don't need supplements because so many common foods are fortified.On the other hand, the AAP acknowledges that taking a supplement won't do any harm as long as it doesn't exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for any vitamin or mineral.Other experts believe that taking a daily supplement is a good way to compensate for any shortfalls in your child's diet.Most experts do agree that:Taking a daily supplement won't hurt as long as it doesn't exceed the RDA for any one vitamin or mineral.Some children  like vegetarians or those with food sensitivities  might need a daily supplement to meet the RDA for certain vitamins or minerals.Supplements are not a substitute for whole foods and should never be used to justify a poor diet. If your child isn't eating well, give him a multivitamin in addition to taking steps to improve his eating habits.The bottom line: If you're concerned that your child isn't meeting the requirements of a balanced diet listed in theU.S. Department of Agriculture's recommendations, a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement can't hurt.Should I give my child a vitamin if she's a picky eater?If you're concerned that your child's diet is lacking  because she won't put anything green in her mouth or because she goes on food jags for days  you might want to give her a supplement for your peace of mind.It provides a little extra insurance that she's getting what he needs, says dietitian Debby Demory-Luce.What kind of vitamin should I give my child?Any generic children's multivitamin (chewable or liquid) will do unless your child has special needs. For example, if your child is a vegetarian, you'll want to make sure that the supplement contains vitamins B12 and D, as well as riboflavin and calcium, which may be lacking in his diet. And if your doctor has determined that your child is anemic, she may recommend a supplement with a specific amount of iron.Also, children younger than 4 aren't able to grind foods when they chew, so give them liquid vitamins to prevent a choking hazard.Children often don't get enough Vitamin D, so the AAP recommends that most children  from babies to adolescents  take a supplement with 400 IU of vitamin D.Note that supplements often don't contain 100 percent of every vitamin and mineral, so you'll still want to make sure your child gets the needed vitamin or mineral from food sources too.If your child doesn't drink milk or eat enough dairy, for example, and only gets about 15 to 20 percent of the RDA for calcium from his supplement, then you'll need to find other food-based sources, such as calcium-fortified orange juice.When choosing a vitamin supplement for your child, read the label carefully. One national survey found that when young children who had diets low in certain nutrients were given vitamin supplements, some of the kids wound up getting more than the recommended upper limit of vitamin A, folic acid, and zinc. So it's a good idea to make sure the supplement you're giving your child isn't high in these nutrients unless your child's doctor says otherwise.Also, keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't hold supplements to the same standards drugs must meet before they're manufactured, so quality and potency might vary between brands. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor guidance.)And don't substitute a vitamin drink for a vitamin supplement. Often vitamin drinks (including sports or energy drinks) contain caffeine and added sugar.Should I give my child more than one vitamin a day if his diet is especially bad one week?No. There's no reason to give your child more than the recommended daily dose (usually one pill a day). ""Some people think that a little is good but more is better,"" says Demory-Luce, ""but this is a dangerous way to approach vitamins.""Not only could it hurt your child, as with too much iron, but an overdose of certain vitamins could also prevent the absorption of others, creating a nutritional imbalance.What precautions should I take with vitamins?Vitamins are formulated to appeal to children and often resemble candy, so kids may eat several at a time if given the opportunity. But getting too much of certain vitamins and minerals (iron, in particular) could be dangerous, or even fatal.So treat vitamins as medicines. Make sure the caps are childproof, but don't depend on them  always keep vitamin bottles well out of the reach of your child.Dietitian Demory-Luce, mother of two, learned this lesson the hard way: ""My youngster got his hands on a bottle of vitamins, opened the safety top, and ate ten vitamins before I got to him,"" she says. ""Luckily, the vitamins didn't have iron in them."" Now she keeps vitamins locked away in a cabinet.To be safe, call poison control if you suspect that your child has taken vitamins on his own, even if they don't contain iron.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013.

It's hard to get all the nutrients you and your baby need, even if you eat a wide variety of food, including meat, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes.Most women can benefit from taking a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement (preferably before trying to conceive). Think of it as an insurance policy to make sure you're getting the right amount of certain crucial nutrients during pregnancy.Taking a prenatal vitamin is even more important for women with dietary restrictions, health issues, or pregnancy complications.

See all videosWhat's in a prenatal supplement that I can't get from food?Two crucial nutrients  folic acid and iron  are almost always included in prenatal vitamins because most pregnant women don't get enough of them from food alone.Folic acidGetting enough of this B vitamin in the month before you conceive and very early in your pregnancy can reduce your baby's risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by up to 70 percent. Folic acid may also reduce the risk of other defects, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and certain heart defects. Taking folic acid may even lower your risk ofpreeclampsia.Your body absorbs the synthetic version of folic acid better than the natural one found in food, so even if you eat a balanced diet, a supplement is strongly recommended.For more details, see our complete article onfolic acid in your pregnancy diet.IronMost moms-to-be don't get enough of this mineral from their diet to meet their body's increased need during pregnancy, and this can lead toiron-deficiency anemia. Preventing iron-deficiency anemia can cut your risk ofpreterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.For more details, see our complete article oniron in your pregnancy diet. Due Date CalculatorFind out your due date, and see how big your baby is right now.What nutrients do I need that may not be in a prenatal supplement?CalciumYour prenatal vitamin may containcalcium, but there's a chance it won't be enough. You need calcium to help your baby grow strong bones and teeth as well ashealthy nerves and muscles (including the heart).Most prenatal vitamins contain between 100 and 200 milligrams (mg) of calcium, but some don't contain any. That's because calcium is a particularly bulky mineral, and the pills are already big enough!To find out how much calcium you need and how to get it, see our complete article oncalcium in your pregnancy diet.Essential fatty acidsPrenatal vitamins don't contain anyessential fatty acids, such as the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, which are important for the development of your baby's brain, nerve, and eye tissue.Fish is a major source of DHA and EPA, but you have to be careful about not eating too much fish that's high in mercury while you're pregnant.Because omega-3s are so important for your baby, it's a good idea to talk with your healthcare practitioner about whether you need a supplement.Learn more:Dietary fats in your pregnancy dietEating fish during pregnancyTaking fish oil supplements during pregnancyVitamin DYour body needs this fat-soluble vitamin to help build your baby's bones and teeth. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining levels of calcium and phosphorus.If you're lacking vitamin D during pregnancy, your baby may be short on the vitamin at birth. This can put your child at risk for rickets (which can lead to fractures and deformity), abnormal bone growth, and delayed physical development. A deficiency of vitamin D has also been linked to a greater risk of developingpregnancy complications such as preeclampsiaand gestational diabetes, but more research is needed to confirm these links.To find out how much vitamin D you need and how to get it, see our complete article onvitamin D in your pregnancy diet.When should I start taking prenatal vitamins?Take a prenatal vitamin every day as soon as you realize you're pregnant.Because folic acid is so important in the earliest weeks of your pregnancy, ideally you would start taking prenatal vitamins before you conceive  that's why many doctors recommend them for women who might become pregnant.Taking prenatal vitamins for at least three months before you conceive also could lessen morning sickness once you're pregnant.And if you breastfeed your baby, your doctor might recommend you continue taking prenatal vitamins even after your baby is born.How do I choose a prenatal supplement that's right for me?Unfortunately, no standards have been set for what should be in vitamin and mineral supplements because the Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate them. That means it's up to you and your healthcare practitioner to make sure you choose one that's safe and appropriate for you. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor more guidance.)At your first prenatal checkup or at a preconception visit, your practitioner will probably prescribe a daily vitamin or recommend an over-the-counter brand. A good supplement provides certain nutrients (such as folic acid and iron) that you may not be able to get enough of from your diet. But it also provides no more than the recommended amounts of other nutrients that can be harmful to your baby if you take too much  likevitamin A.Vitamin A derived from animal products can cause birth defects when taken in high doses. That's why the vitamin A in most prenatal vitamins is at least partly in the form of beta-carotene.Beta-carotene is a nutrient found in fruits and vegetables, and your body converts this type to vitamin A. Unlike vitamin A from animal products, beta-carotene is considered safe even in high doses.Note: Make sure you don't take any other vitamin or mineral supplements while you're taking a prenatal supplement unless your practitioner recommends it. What if I mistakenly take two prenatal vitamins on the same day?Don't worry. Taking twice the recommended amounts of these nutrients on just one day won't harm you or your baby. But taking a double dose more often can be harmful, so it's important not to do it regularly.If your practitioner says you need more of a certain nutrient than your prenatal vitamin provides, take the additional amount as a separate supplement.What if I have trouble swallowing the pills?Prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements tend to be pretty big. They can be hard to swallow, especially if you're dealing withnausea.If this is a problem for you, your practitioner may be able to recommend a smaller pill or one with a slick coating that makes it easier to get down. (Pills that don't contain calcium tend to be smaller, and you can get your calcium in other ways.)Chewable prenatal vitamins are also available. There's even a powdered pregnancy supplement that you mix with water. So if you don't like one version, keep trying different options until you find a prenatal supplement you can take.What if the vitamins upset my stomach?If you're taking a supplement with more than the recommended 30 mg of iron, it may upset your gastrointestinal tract. (Supplements that contain 30 mg or less probably won't cause you any problems.)To avoid queasiness, try taking your supplement at bedtime or with a meal to make it easier to tolerate.Taking a lot of iron can lead to constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. It can also cause nausea or, more rarely, diarrhea.If iron upsets your stomach, talk to your healthcare practitioner about it. If you're not anemic, it may make sense for you to switch to a prenatal vitamin with less iron. Otherwise, try to ease constipation by:Drinking prune juiceEating two to three servings of fruit a dayTaking a psyllium fiber supplementShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2014.

Vitamin C in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-c-in-your-pregnancy-diet_660.bc,"Why you need vitamin C during pregnancyBoth you and your baby need vitamin C daily because it's necessary for the body to make collagen, a structural protein that's a component of cartilage, tendons, bones, and skin. Based on animal studies, some researchers believe that vitamin C deficiencies in newborn babies can impair mental development.Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is essential for tissue repair, wound healing, bone growth and repair, and healthy skin. Vitamin C helps your body fight infections and acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.Vitamin C also helps your body absorbiron, especially from vegetarian sources.How much vitamin C you needPregnant women age 18 and younger: 80 milligrams (mg) per dayPregnant women age 19 and older: 85 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 18 and younger: 115 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 19 and older: 120 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 18 and younger: 65 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 19 and older: 75 mg per dayFood sources of vitamin CCitrus fruits are especially high in vitamin C, but leafy greens and many other fruits and vegetables are also excellent sources. Choose fresh foods as your source of vitamin C because heat can destroy this vitamin. Also, some cereals and juices are fortified with vitamin C.Try to include a food rich in vitamin C at every meal to maximize the amount of iron you get from the other foods you eat.Foods that provide vitamin C include:6 ounces orange juice: 62 to 93 mg6 ounces grapefruit juice: 62 to 70 mgone kiwi: 91 mg1/2 cup raw, sweet red bell pepper, chopped: 95 mg1 cup whole strawberries: 85 mgone medium orange: 70 mg1/2 cup broccoli, cooked: 51 mg1/2 medium grapefruit: 38 mgone medium baked potato: 17 mgone medium tomato: 16 mg1 cup raw spinach: 8 mgShould you take a vitamin C supplement?Probably not. It's easiest and safest to get your daily requirement from food. A glass of orange juice at breakfast every day is all you need. (Choose calcium-fortified OJ for even more nutritional value.)Although some studies show that vitamin C supplementation can reduce the incidence of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), there is some concern that taking vitamin C supplements during pregnancy may raise the risk ofpreterm birth.There are also reports (though rare) of babies born to mothers who took excessive vitamin C supplements during pregnancy developing scurvy, a severe vitamin C deficiency.If you're concerned about your vitamin C intake, talk with your healthcare provider.The signs of a vitamin C deficiencySigns of a deficiency include fatigue, gum inflammation, slow-healing cuts, bruises, and rough, dry skin.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Vitamin D in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-d-in-your-pregnancy-diet_661.bc,"Why you need vitamin D during pregnancyYour body needs vitamin D to maintain proper levels ofcalciumand phosphorus, which help build your baby's bones and teeth.What happens if you don't get enough vitamin DVitamin D deficiency is common during pregnancy. Inadequate vitamin D can lead to abnormal bone growth, fractures, or rickets in newborns. Some studies link vitamin D deficiency to a higher risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, but more research is needed to confirm these links.The symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency can be subtle. They may include achy muscles, weakness, bone pain, and softened bones, which may lead to fractures.You can also have a vitamin D deficiency without any symptoms. And if that happens while you're pregnant, your baby can suffer a deficiency, too.How much vitamin D you needVitamin D dosage is a topic of debate. The Institute of Medicine currently recommends that all women  whether or not they're pregnant or breastfeeding  get 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D or 15 micrograms (mcg) each day.But many experts believe that 600 IU isn't nearly enough. The Linus Pauling Institute, for example, recommends all adults take 2,000 IU of supplemental vitamin D each day. The Endocrine Society says 600 IU may be enough, but some people  including pregnant and breastfeeding women  may need 1,500 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D.In 2015, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that more safety research is needed before the organization would recommend more vitamin D than what's in a standard prenatal vitamin. Ask your healthcare provider for advice about how much vitamin D you need during pregnancy.Food sources of vitamin DFish liver oil, fatty fish, and eggs all contain vitamin D. But not many other foods contain vitamin D naturally, so a lot are fortified with this important vitamin. Be sure to check labels: Some cheeses, yogurts, and cereals are fortified while others aren't. (All milk is vitamin D fortified.)Here are some of the best food sources of vitamin D:3 ounces canned pink salmon: 465 IU (11.6 mcg)3 ounces canned mackerel: 211 IU (5.3 mcg)3 ounces canned sardines: 164 IU (4.1 mcg)8 ounces orange juice, fortified with vitamin D: 100 IU (2.5 mcg)8 ounces low-fat milk, fortified with vitamin D: 98 IU (2.5 mcg)1 cup cereal, fortified with vitamin D: 40 to 50 IU (1.0 to 1.3 mcg)one large egg yolk: 37 IU (0.9 mcg)Should you take a vitamin D supplement?Maybe. Most prenatal vitamins only contain 400 IU (10 mcg) of vitamin D, and it's difficult to get sufficient vitamin D from foods alone, even when you choose fortified foods.Since the skin uses the sun's rays to produce vitamin D, some experts recommend limited sun exposure, while others caution against it without the protection of sunblock and clothing. Exposure to the sun's ultraviolet [UV] rays intensifies the pigment changes that cause irregularskin darkeningin pregnant women, so most doctors recommend that pregnant women protect themselves from the sun and get their vitamin D from food or supplements.Factors that might put you at risk for a vitamin D deficiency include:Obesity. Because body fat stores much of the vitamin D made in the skin, it's less available to the body. (Vitamin D that you get from food and supplements appears to be more available to the body, so those are more reliable sources.)Darker skin. People with darker skin have a lot of melanin, which acts as a natural sunscreen and reduces production of vitamin D in the skin. Certain medications. Medications such as steroids, antiseizure medications, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and some diuretics reduce absorption of vitamin D from the intestines.Fat malabsorption conditions. Disorders such as celiac disease and Crohn's disease involve a reduced ability to absorb dietary fat, and that leads to less absorption of vitamin D.If you're worried about not getting enough vitamin D, ask your healthcare provider if you should be tested for a deficiency or if you need to take a vitamin D supplement. When choosing a supplement, look for the kind labeled vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, which is the most effective form. (Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, is about 25 percent less potent.)Show sources Hide sources IOM. 1997. Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin d, and fluoride.

Vitamin B6 in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-b6-in-your-pregnancy-diet_666.bc,"Why you need vitamin B6 during pregnancyVitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is vital to your baby's developing brain and nervous system. Vitamin B6 also helps your baby metabolize protein and carbohydrates.Research shows that extra vitamin B6 may relievenausea or vomiting for some women during pregnancy, though no one is exactly sure why.Vitamin B6 also helps your body metabolize protein and carbohydrates and helps form new red blood cells, antibodies, and neurotransmitters.How much vitamin B6 you needPregnant women: 1.9 milligrams (mg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 2.0 mg per dayNonpregnant women ages 19 to 50: 1.3 mg per dayFood sources of vitamin B6Nuts, lean meat, and fish are good sources of vitamin B6. Fortified breads and cereals can also be good sources. (Check the labels.)Here are some other good food sources of vitamin B6:one medium russet baked potato (with skin): 0.70 mg3 ounces light turkey meat, cooked: 0.69 mgone medium avocado: 0.52 mg3 ounces light chicken meat, cooked (without skin): 0.51 mg1 cup fortified breakfast cereal: 0.5 to 2.5 mg3 ounces wild salmon, cooked: 0.48 to 0.8 mg1 cup spinach, cooked: 0.44 mgone medium banana: 0.43 mg1 cup dried plums, pitted: 0.36 mg1 ounce hazelnuts, dry roasted: 0.18 mg6 ounces vegetable juice cocktail: 0.13 mg(Note that a 3-ounce serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a vitamin B6 supplement?You should be able to get all you need from a varied diet. Mostprenatal vitaminsalso contain at least 100 percent of the recommended amount.If you're suffering frommorning sickness, check with your healthcare provider before taking additionalB6 supplements. She can tell you how much to take. (Don't take more than your provider recommends. Too much may not be safe for you or your developing baby.)Some high-potency multivitamins contain vitamin B6 in large amounts. But even without taking a supplement you can get too much B6 in your diet if you eat a lot of fortified foods. Read the labels of energy drinks and bars, for example  they sometimes have several times the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for B6. Excessive amounts of vitamin B6 can cause numbness and nerve damage.The signs of a vitamin B6 deficiencyInflammation of the tongue, sores or mouth ulcers, depression, and anemia may signal a deficiency.

Vitamin C in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-c-in-your-childs-diet_10324695.bc,"Vitamin C is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin C your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin C is importantVitamin C helps form and repair red blood cells, bones, and tissues. It helps your child's gums stay healthy and strengthens your child's blood vessels, minimizing bruising from falls and scrapes. In addition, vitamin C helps cuts and wounds heal, boosts the immune system, and keeps infections at bay. And it helps the body absorb iron from food sources.How much vitamin C does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 15 milligrams (mg) dailyAges 4 to 8: 25 mg dailyThis vitamin is available in so many foods that deficiencies are extremely rare. Children who are very picky eaters and don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables may not get enough vitamin C. Also, children exposed to secondhand smoke need more vitamin C to repair cell damage from cigarettes.If you're concerned that your child doesn't get enough vitamin C, ask your child's doctor whether you need to boost your child's intake.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin C every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin CBrightly colored fruits and vegetables are great sources of vitamin C.1/4 cup guava: 82.5 mg1/2 cup orange juice: 50 mg1/4 cup red bell pepper: 47.5 mg1/4 cup papaya: 47.5 mg1/4 cup kiwi: 41 mg1/2 medium orange: 30 mg1/4 cup broccoli: 30 mgthree medium strawberries: 21 mg1/4 cup pink grapefruit: 23 mg1/4 cup cantaloupe: 17 mg1/4 cup mango: 11 mg1/4 cup raw tomato: 5 mg1/4 cup spinach: 4.5 mg1/4 cup potato, cooked without skin: 3 mg1/4 cup banana: 2 mgThe amount of vitamin C in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or vegetable.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin C?Vitamin C is water soluble, so any excess is flushed from the body in your child's urine. However, megadoses can still cause nausea, diarrhea, kidney stones, and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 400 mg of vitamin C a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 650 mg a day.Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. So be careful before giving a child chewable supplements meant for adults because each tablet can contain up to 500 mg.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenShow sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Read on to find out how much vitamin D your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy vitamin D is importantVitamin D helps the body absorb minerals like calcium and builds strong teeth and bones. According to researcher Michael F. Holick, professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, vitamin D deficiency can not only cause rickets (a disease that can lead to bone deformity and fractures), it can also keep a child from reaching her genetically programmed height and peak bone mass.Vitamin D also functions as a hormone with many other jobs in the body, including regulation of the immune system, insulin production, and cell growth.How much vitamin D does my child need?Infants up to 12 months old need 400 international units (IU), or 10 micrograms (mcg), a day. Children older than 1 need 600 IU, or 15 mcg, a day.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin D every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin DVitamin D is called the ""sunshine vitamin"" because the body can produce it when the skin is exposed to sunlight. But your child's body isn't able to make vitamin D when covered with clothing or sunscreen to block the sun's rays. Other obstacles to vitamin D production from sun exposure include smog, clouds, dark skin, and geographic location.Though it's hard to estimate how much time a person needs to spend in the sun to make the recommended amount of vitamin D, some researchers say spending 5 to 30 minutes outside between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at least twice a week should do it.But experts warn that UV radiation from the sun is the main cause of skin cancer, and it's hard to judge whether you can get enough vitamin D from the sun without increasing your risk of a potentially deadly skin cancer. So consider finding other ways to get the vitamin D you need.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants, children, and teens take vitamin D supplements of 400 IU each day. Kids who are too young for chewable vitamins can take liquid supplements.Some of the best food sources of vitamin D:1 ounce salmon: 102 IU6 ounces fortified yogurt: 80 IU1 ounce canned tuna, drained and packed in oil: 66 IU1/2 cup orange juice, fortified with 25 percent of daily value for vitamin D: 50 IU1/2 cup fortified milk (whole, low-fat, or skim): 49 IUone slice fortified American cheese: 40 IU1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 19 IU1 ounce mackerel: 11.6 IU1/2 large egg yolk: 10 IU1/2 teaspoon fortified margarine: 10 IU1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 6 IUThe amount of vitamin D in a food varies somewhat, depending on the brand of the product.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin D?It's unlikely but possible. On the contrary, many health experts are concerned that the current recommended amount is too low and that children actually need much more.That said, vitamin D can be harmful if you get too much. According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (a department of the National Institutes of Health), the safe upper limit for infants up to 12 months old is 1,000 to 1,500 IU daily. For kids 1 to 8 years old, the safe upper limit is 2,500 to 3,000 IU each day.Vitamin D is stored in body tissue, so it's best not to get more than what health experts recommend. (Vitamin C, by contrast, isn't stored in the body  any excess is simply eliminated in urine.)To be safe, if you have a very young child, stick to the 400 IUs recommended as an infant supplement. More than 400 IUs may be fine for an older child, but check with your child's doctor to be sure.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Note that nuts and seeds are choking hazards for very young children, and nut butters should be spread thinly for the same reason.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, depending on their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin E?It's far more likely that your child won't get enough of this vital nutrient. But because vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding problems, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has set upper intake levels for vitamin E. (This is the maximum amount that's considered safe.)A 2- or 3-year-old child should not get more than 200 mg (300 IU) of vitamin E daily. A 4- to 8-year-old child should not get more than 300 mg (450 IU) of vitamin E daily.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Your pregnancy: 13 weeks,https://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnancy-13-weeks_1102.bc,
4 key nutrients you may be missing,https://www.babycenter.com/0_4-key-nutrients-you-may-be-missing_10352387.bc,"In a perfect world, we'd get all the nutrients we need from well-balanced home-cooked meals. Unfortunately, with today's jam-packed schedules and on-the-go dining, we're likely to fall short on critical nutrients.Revamp your diet to make sure you include the following key nutrients and you'll not only function better, you'll help stave off disease and may even extend your life.Omega-3sResearch shows that consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of heart disease. Omega-3s DHA and EPA do this by helping prevent irregular heartbeats, reducing plaque buildup and inflammation in the arteries, and keeping blood sugar levels in check.Need more reasons to load up on omega-3s? Researchers from the National Institutes of Health report that they're more effective at combating depression than commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs.Where to find them:Fatty fish like salmon, trout, and sardines. (Some plant foods contain the omega-3 ALA, but this fatty acid hasn't been proven to provide the health benefits of DHA and EPA.) Eating just one or two servings of fatty fish a week can slash your risk of dying from heart disease by 36 percent. Not into fish? Take a supplement.Vitamin DFor years, scientists thought vitamin D's only role was to enhance the absorption of calcium from food. New research shows that vitamin D can reduce chronic pain, ease PMS, guard against heart disease, and even ward off cancer.Trouble is, most of us don't get enough vitamin D to maintain bone health, let alone reach the levels that protect against chronic disease. People used to get a lot of vitamin D from sunlight. Nowadays we protect ourselves from the sun, and our vitamin D levels have declined as a result. What's more, experts say the current daily recommendation of 400 IU is too low, and that most Americans need a minimum of 1,000 IU of vitamin D every day, especially in the absence of sunlight.Where to find it:It may be difficult to get all of the vitamin D you need by loading up on vitamin D-rich foods like salmon and fortified milk and cereal. To get the recommended 1,000 IU, look for supplements that contain vitamin D (cholecalciferol), an active form that's more effective than its vitamin D2 counterpart.FiberDietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, helps keep blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent health problems ranging from cancer to stroke. Even though the nutrient is widely available in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, most Americans get very little. Our average intake is a paltry 14 grams per day, compared to the recommended 25 to 35 grams.""People are spending less money at the supermarket and more money at fast food joints that don't serve high-fiber meals,"" says Milton Stokes, research assistant at the University of Connecticut and founder of One Source Nutrition in Stamford. ""Not only does this increase the chance of constipation  an ailment that affects more than 4 million Americans  it also can lead to weight gain.""Where to find it:Fortunately, fiber is easy to find. Oatmeal, beans, barley, and most fruits and vegetables (especially apples, berries, and broccoli) are chock full of the stuff. If you're adding fiber to your diet, make sure to boost your water intake, too. A sudden increase in fiber consumption without water can cause bloating, constipation, and other tummy troubles.CalciumWhile the ""Got milk?"" campaign has done an excellent job of reminding us that calcium-rich foods promote strong bones, it fails to mention the many other roles calcium has. In fact, getting enough calcium can help prevent diseases ranging from diabetes and cancer to hypertension and heart disease.""Calcium is important for muscle function, not just bone health,"" says Christine Gerbstadt, national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. ""The heart is a muscle and it needs calcium, too."" Only 21 percent of adults get the recommended amount of calcium (1,000 mg per day for women 19 to 50, and 1,200 mg for women 51 and over).Where to find it:According to Gerbstadt, two to three servings of dairy every day should meet your needs. Want extra insurance? Consider taking a supplement or choosing calcium-fortified cereals or orange juice."
Eating a vegetarian diet during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-a-vegetarian-diet-during-pregnancy_1313874.bc,"Is it safe to eat a vegetarian diet in pregnancy?Yes. As long as you eat a variety of healthy vegetarian foods and plan your diet to include key nutrients, you can get all the nourishment you and your baby need, whether you're vegetarian or vegan. (Vegans do not eat any animal products including meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy, and honey.)If you're vegan, see our article on whether it's safe to eat a vegan diet during pregnancy.In some cases, you'll need to rely on fortified foods or supplements to make sure you're getting enough of what you need. Let your healthcare provider know about your diet at your preconception visit or your first prenatal visit. And always consult your doctor, midwife, or a dietitian before taking any supplements while you're pregnant.Along with a variety of fruit and vegetables (fresh, frozen, or canned) and whole grain products, you'll want to make sure you eat foods or take supplements that provide the following nutrients important for a healthy pregnancy.ProteinEat several servings of protein-rich foods each day. Good sources of vegetarian protein include eggs, dairy products, legumes, soy foods, nuts, seeds, and nut butters.Here are some ideas on how to work these foods into your diet:Add beans (such as kidney, black, or white), chickpeas, lentils, or tofu cubes to a saladHave a bean burritoSnack on a handful of almonds, walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, or roasted chickpeasSpread peanut or almond butter on whole grain bread or sliced applesSnack on yogurt or cottage cheeseSlice up a hard-boiled eggIronYour prenatal vitamin will likely provide some iron. But you'll also need to eat several servings of a variety of iron-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Iron-fortified breakfast cerealWhole grain or enriched foods, such as bread and pastaBeans and other legumesTofu, tempeh, and other soy-based foodsLeafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and chardAvoid having tea or coffee with your meals because these drinks contain tannins and polyphenols, which make it harder for your body to absorb iron from vegetables. Instead, have something that's rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, tomato sauce, or broccoli, to help your body absorb the iron.You'll have a blood test early in your pregnancy to check your iron level. If yours is low, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take an iron supplement.ZincTry to get several servings of zinc-rich foods every day. Many foods that provide iron  such as fortified breakfast cereals, beans, soy foods, and whole grains  also provide zinc. Other good sources of zinc for vegetarians include nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and cheese.CalciumHave several servings of a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Milk, cheese, and yogurtCalcium-fortified almond or soy milk, fruit juice, and breakfast cerealsWhite beans, blackstrap molasses, tahini, and calcium-set tofu. (To see if the tofu is calcium-set, check the list of ingredients for a calcium salt, such as calcium chloride or calcium sulfate.)Almonds or sesame seedsCertain green vegetables, including kale, collards, turnip greens, napa cabbage, broccoli, and bok choy. (Others, such as spinach, beet greens, and chard, contain calcium, but your body doesn't absorb the calcium from these vegetables as well.)Vitamin DThis vitamin helps your body absorb calcium. Cow's milk and some types of orange juice, cereal, and plant milk are fortified with vitamin D. Many prenatal supplements include vitamin D. If yours doesn't, you may want to consider taking a supplement.B12Vitamin B12 plays an important role in your baby's brain development. Eating several servings of dairy foods every day should provide you with enough, but if you are a vegetarian who limits or avoids dairy, you'll need to eat foods fortified with vitamin B12. These may include soy and other plant milks, breakfast cereals, and nutritional yeast. (Check for fortification on the product label.)If you don't eat dairy or fortified foods every day, and your prenatal supplement doesn't contain B12, you'll need to take a separate vitamin B12 supplement.IodineIodine is also important for your baby's brain development. Iodized salt, dried seaweed, cow's milk, and yogurt are good vegetarian sources of iodine. If you don't get a lot of these, check to make sure your prenatal vitamin contains iodine.DHADHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that promotes the development of your unborn baby's eyes and brain. It's found in fish, fish oil, and algae. Because it can be very difficult to obtain DHA from non-fish sources, you may want to take an omega-3 supplement derived from algae and suitable for vegetarians.NOTE: This article was reviewed by Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, LDN, adjunct associate professor in the nutrition department of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Show sources Hide sources Foster M et al. 2015.

Trying to conceive? Five changes to make to your diet now,https://www.babycenter.com/0_trying-to-conceive-five-changes-to-make-to-your-diet-now_3558.bc,"Don't wait until you're pregnant to improve your eating habits. Set the stage now with healthy diet changes to ensure your baby gets off to a strong start.Pay attention to your dietFor both men and women, food and fertility are linked. Stick to a balanced diet to boost your chances of a healthy baby.Eat several servings of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods such as yogurt, cheese, and milk every day. Not getting enough nutrients can affect your periods, making it difficult to predict when you ovulate. And you may not ovulate at all if you're significantly underweight or obese.Your partner should also pay attention to his diet since certain vitamins and nutrients  such as zinc and vitamins C and E, and folic acid  are important for making healthy sperm.How can I get pregnant quickly?

See all videosFish is a nutritional powerhouse for a growing baby, offering low-fat protein with omega-3 fatty acids, but you need to take care to avoid types that are high in mercury, which can be dangerous to your unborn baby. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration urges women to eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week.Because mercury can accumulate in your body and linger there for more than a year, avoid high-mercury fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Instead, eat lower-mercury fish such as salmon and canned light tuna (not albacore, which is higher in mercury) once or twice a week. Read more oneating fish while trying to conceive.Processed meats can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and should be consumed in small amounts, and smoked or raw meats should be avoided entirely during pregnancy. Even hot dogs or deli meats should be heated until they are steaming before you eat them if you are pregnant.Practice good habits for pregnancyFor many moms-to-be, pregnancy prompts an abrupt change in eating and drinking habits  but some habits are hard to break. Make it easier on yourself by changing habits now, and help ensure your baby gets off to a good start from the moment you conceive.Some solid advice: The occasional bottle of beer or glass of wine probably won't affect your chances of getting pregnant, but alcohol can harm a developing baby. And since you may not know exactly when you ovulate or conceive, you may want to play it safe and cut out alcohol completely. (For non-alcoholic alternatives, see our list of the best virgin drinks).On a related note, if you use any recreational drugs or smoke, quit now. All of these substances and habits can harm a developing fetus.You may also want to cut back on caffeine. The research on whether caffeine can affect fertility is mixed. Experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption, less than 300 mg a day or about the equivalent of two 8-ounce cups of coffee, won't affect your fertility, but your healthcare provider may recommend that you cut caffeine out entirely to play it safe. Learn more aboutcaffeine and fertility.And once you're pregnant, experts recommend limiting yourself to less than 200 milligrams a day of caffeine  that's a little less than a 12-ounce cup of coffee  because higher amounts have been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage. If you have a strong coffee or soda habit, you might want to start weaning yourself off caffeine now.Take prenatal vitaminsAlthough you can meet almost all of your nutritional needs through a balanced diet, many experts believe that even the healthiest eaters can use extra help. Taking a prenatal vitamin ensures that you're getting enough folic acid and other essential nutrients to boost your chances of conceiving a healthy baby.Remember that a supplement is a safeguard, not a substitute for a sound diet. And since regular over-the-counter multivitamins may contain megadoses of vitamins and minerals that could be harmful to a developing baby, choose a pill formulated specifically for pregnant women. If you have a vegetarian diet, you may also need vitamin D and B-12 supplements, along with extra protein. Talk with your healthcare provider about the right prenatal supplement for you.Get enough folic acidFolic acid has been proven to reduce a baby's risk of neural-tube birth defects such as spina bifida, and it is linked to a lower incidence of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and diabetes.Most women of child-bearing age should take a supplement with 400 micrograms (mcg) daily for at least a month before pregnancy, and 600 micrograms during pregnancy. If you have a family history of neural-tube birth defects or take medication for seizures, your healthcare provider may suggest that you boost your daily intake to 4,000 mcg, or 4 mg, starting at least a month before you conceive and continuing throughout your first trimester.A good over-the-counter prenatal vitamin should contain more than the minimum recommendation of folic acid, between 600 and 800 mcg  what you'll need during pregnancy. In addition, you can eat folate-rich foods, such as dark green leafy vegetables like spinach or kale, citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and fortified breads and cereals.Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, so your body will flush out the excess if you consume too much. But there's a downside to being water-soluble, too: You can lose a lot of this vitamin in cooking water, so steam or cook vegetables in a small amount of water to preserve the folate.Be aware that getting too much folate may hide a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is sometimes a problem for vegetarians. Ask your doctor or midwife if you think you may be at risk.Maintain a healthy weightIt might be a good idea to shed some pounds, or gain a few if you're underweight, while you're trying to get pregnant, since you want to be as close as possible to your recommended weight when you conceive. Being over- or underweight can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, obese women have more pregnancy and birth complications, and underweight women are more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby.In addition to following a smart eating plan with low-fat, high-fiber foods, get regular exercise. If you're overweight, aim to lose one to two pounds a week, a safe rate of weight loss. Extreme weight loss from crash dieting can deplete your body's nutritional stores, which isn't a good way to start a pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Undated.

What's your pregnancy nutrition IQ?,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-nutrition-iq,

Cow's milk: A powerful ally,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-a-powerful-ally_10372093.bc,"Why do experts recommend that children drink cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. And it's one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. Almost all milk in the U.S. is fortified with vitamin D. (Ultraviolet rays are another source, but they're blocked by sunscreen.)Milk also provides protein for growth, as well as carbohydrates, which will give your child the energy he needs. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.How much milk should my child drink?According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), most kids will get enough calcium and vitamin D if they drink 16 to 20 ounces (2 to 2 1/2 cups) of cow's milk a day. (Most 1-year-olds should have whole milk. Low-fat or fat-free milk is fine for children 2 and older.)Don't offer more than 3 cups of milk a day or your child may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out his diet. If your child's still thirsty, offer water.My child doesn't like cow's milk. Any tricks I can try?Meeting the minimum requirement of 2 cups can be a challenge if your child doesn't care for milk. But there are many ways to get milk into your child's diet: Add it to his cereal. Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks. Make soup with milk rather than water. Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child doesn't like any dairy products? Or if she's allergic or we're vegans?If your child isn't getting enough calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, perhaps because she can't tolerate them or your family is vegan, your pediatrician will probably recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.The AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious illness or even death.Could my child have a milk allergy?True allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon. Only 2 to 3 percent of children are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it by age 3. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.)If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that she'll have no problems tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in their mother's milk (unless their mother avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before starting her on cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)The main symptoms of milk allergy are blood in the stool, diarrhea, and vomiting. If your child also develops eczema, hives, a rash around the mouth and chin, chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties, it could be a sign that the respiratory system is being affected by a milk allergy. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.If your child appears to have sudden and severe problems with breathing or swallowing, take her to the nearest emergency room. She may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products  in this case, the label will say ""milk."""

Feeding problems: Refusing to eat,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-refusing-to-eat_9203.bc,"The problemOne of the first skills your toddler masters is feeding herself. Though she can't control much in her life right now, she can definitely control what she puts in her mouth.So it's no surprise when she's very opinionated about what she will  and won't  eat. She may eat only one or two preferred foods for weeks, then suddenly change her mind and want something completely different. Don't worry  this is typical toddler behavior.What you can doYour child needs some encouragement and structure from you when it comes to mealtimes (such as regular meals and healthy choices), but not much more. William Sears, noted pediatrician and author of 23 books on childcare, says whether and how much your child eats should ultimately be up to her. ""Your child may eat well one day and eat practically nothing the next,"" says Dr. Sears, who co-authored The Family Nutrition Book with his wife, Martha.Rather than get hung up on the fact that your child has refused everything you put in front of her today, consider what she's eaten over the course of one week. Parents are often surprised to find that their child's food intake balances out. Something must be fueling all that energy!Rest assured: As long as your child is growing and gaining weight accordingly, you can be confident that your toddler is getting enough to eat. If you're concerned, ask your child's doctor to go over your child's growth chart. You may be relieved to find out you dont have anything to worry about!Here are a few tips to help get through those bumpy patches:Offer a variety of healthy food choices and let your toddler feed herself. This way she gets to exercise a little independence.Don't threaten her or bargain with her. ""One more bite and you get a cookie,"" or, ""No story time if you don't eat your peas,"" makes mealtime into a power struggle. If you want to raise a healthy eater, keep mealtimes positive, and don't use sweets as a reward.Have meals as a family whenever possible. When your toddler sees you or her siblings eating healthy food, she's more likely to want to follow along.Don't take something off the menu if she doesn't like it. Kids are slow to accept new tastes and textures, so if she spits out green beans the first time, try making them again the following week. She may surprise you and decide they're her new favorite food. (Though you may have to offer a new food many times before she's willing to make it a regular part of her diet.)Don't forget to consider how much she drinks in the food equation, too. Drinking too much milk or juice can dampen an appetite, so you may want to serve milk between meals and limit juice to no more than 1/2 to 3/4 cup a day. Don't offer juice to infants younger than 1. Milk and 100 percent juice can supply vital nutrients (though too much juice means too much sugar, and fruit juice lacks the fiber and some nutrients found in fruit).And don't let her fill up on sweets and junk food  her growing body needs the nutrients supplied by a healthy diet, not empty calories.Extra vitaminsThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that a daily multivitamin isn't usually necessary if your toddler eats a variety of food. But if she doesn't eat much meat or fish, iron-fortified cereal, or iron-rich dark green vegetables, she may need an iron supplement. The best way to know whether your child needs a daily multivitamin  and what kind to give her  is to check with her doctor.And whether or not your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will still need some extra vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which build bones. Sunscreen prevents sunlight from synthesizing vitamin D, and it's difficult to get this essential nutrient from milk alone, so doctors recommend giving children 400 international units (IUs) of vitamin D daily.Most multivitamins contain vitamin D. If your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will usually not need an extra vitamin D supplement.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013a. Dietary supplements for toddlers.

Diet for a healthy breastfeeding mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-a-healthy-breastfeeding-mom_3565.bc,"Many new moms wonder how breastfeeding will affect their diet. You probably don't need to make any major changes to what you eat or drink when you're nursing, though there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:Eat a well-balanced diet for your healthOne of the wonders of breast milk is that it can meet your baby's nutritional needs even when you're not eating perfectly. (However, if your diet is too low in calories or relies on one food group at the exclusion of others, this could affect the quality and quantity of your milk.)Just because your baby won't be harmed by your occasional dietary lapses doesn't mean that you won't suffer. When you don't get the nutrients you need from your diet, your body draws on its reserves, which can eventually become depleted. Also, you need strength and stamina to meet the physical demands of caring for a new baby.Many breastfeeding moms feel extra hungry, which makes sense: Your body is working around the clock to make breast milk for your baby. Eating small meals with healthy snacks in between  the way you may have done during pregnancy  is a good way to keep your hunger in check and your energy level high.Breastfeeding lessons learned: 5 things I never knew Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 6:21Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -6:21Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

A filmmaker and mother of two shares what she wants new moms to know. See all baby videosDon't count caloriesThere's no single answer to how many calories a nursing mom needs. But in general, most women who are breastfeeding need about 500 calories more than moms who aren't  that's a total of 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day.Instead of counting calories, follow your hunger as a guide to how much you need to eat.The exact amount depends on a number of individual factors, such as your weight, how much exercise you get, how your metabolism works, and how frequently you're breastfeeding.If you're concerned about putting on excess pounds, talk to your healthcare provider about your body mass index and what you can do to maintain a healthy weight. How to use a breast pumpLearn about the different types of breast pumps, the basics of how they work, and the right way to use a breast pump.Aim for slow and steady weight lossSome new moms find the weight just seems to fall off, while others don't lose much. It all depends on your body, your food choices, your activity level, and your metabolism.The best plan: Lose your pregnancy weight gradually. Plan to take up to a year to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight.Don't try to lose weight by dieting until at least two months after your baby is born. A reduced-calorie diet in the first couple of months could sap your energy and diminish your milk supply.If you're overweight or obese, you may be able to start trying to shed pounds earlier but first ask your doctor for advice. And be sure to stay hydrated  sometimes dieters cut back on water when they eat less food.Most women can safely lose 1 pound each week by combining a healthy diet with moderate exercise.A sudden, large drop in your calorie intake can affect your milk supply, so don't go on a crash diet to lose weight quickly. If you're losing more than 1 pound a week after the first six weeks, that's a sign you need to take in more calories. Include a variety of healthy foodsVariety and balance are key to a healthy diet. Eating a mix of carbohydrates protein, and fat at meals keeps you feeling full longer and supplies the nutrients your body needs.Complex carbs like whole grains and cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables not only provide more nutrition than processed starches and sugars, they provide longer-lasting energy. And choosing from all food groups is important so you can get the vitamins you and your baby need over time. So mix it up  try to eat something today that you didn't eat yesterday. Strawberry and asparagus saladThis spinach salad topped with asparagus, strawberries, and pistachios is perfect as a light lunch.Choose good fatsWhen it comes to fat, think mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Sources of these ""healthy fats"" include canola oil, olive oil, and fatty fish (like salmon) as well as avocados, olives, nuts, and seeds.Limit saturated fats and avoid trans fats, both of which are considered unhealthy. Saturated fats show up in high-fat meats, whole milk, tropical oils (such as palm kernel and coconut), butter, and lard. Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats. Saturated fats and trans fats are both listed on a product's nutrition label.In addition to being bad for your diet, getting too much of these unhealthy fats can alter the fat composition of your breast milk, which isn't good for your baby's health.While we don't know the long-term effects of unhealthy fats on infant cardiovascular health, we do know that in adults these fats negatively affect heart health by raising LDL (bad cholesterol), lowering HDL (good cholesterol), and increasing signs of inflammation. Unhealthy fats also boost the risk of heart attack and death from heart disease.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.Take extra steps to avoid contaminantsIt's a good idea to try to minimize your exposure to contaminants in your food (and your environment) while you're nursing. Pesticides, insecticides, and other chemicals that you ingest can make their way into your breast milk.Although research is ongoing, we know that environmental chemicals could affect your baby's long-term health. Here are some tips for limiting your exposure:Eat a variety of foods. If you eat large quantities of one food that happens to be high in pesticides, your intake of pesticides will be higher than if that food is just one of many that you eat.Know which fruits and vegetables are highest in pesticides, and choose organic options if possible. Always wash fruits and veggies well. Or better yet, peel them. As of 2011 the ""dirty dozen"" that tested highest for pesticides, according to the Environmental Working Group, were apples, celery, strawberries, peaches, spinach, imported nectarines and grapes, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, blueberries, lettuce, and kale and collard greens.The fruits and vegetables that had the lowest amount of pesticide residue were onions, sweet corn, pineapples, avocados, asparagus, sweet peas, mangoes, eggplant, cantaloupe, kiwi, cabbage, watermelon, sweet potatoes, grapefruit, and mushrooms.Choose produce that's in season in your area, and buy local when you can. Produce that travels long distances often have more pesticides.Choose lean meats, and remove the skin and extra fat before cooking. Chemicals are stored in fat.Consider drinking filtered water while breastfeeding. The EPA requires that all tap water meet certain standards, but small amounts of many chemicals are found in tap water. Eat fish  but be pickyWhen you're nursing, it's important to get protein from a variety of sources  including fish. The American Heart Association recommends fish for a heart-healthy diet.Some fish (especially cold water fish) also contain DHA and EPA, omega-3 fats that play an important role in the brain and eye development that continues during your baby's first year. (Your baby gets these omega-3s from your breast milk.)Not only does DHA help your baby, but it helps you too. Research suggests that moms who have lower levels of DHA, as well as lower seafood consumption, are more likely to develop postpartum depression.Eat up to 12 ounces of most types of fish and seafood per week, including salmon, shrimp, canned light tuna, lake trout, tilapia, catfish, crab, pollack, and scallops.If you don't like seafood, try an omega-3 supplement. Just be sure to talk to your healthcare provider first to find out how much to take.Also, be aware that some types of fish contain contaminants that can be harmful to pregnant and nursing women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Agriculture advise not eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.Solid white or albacore tuna tends to be higher in mercury than other types of canned tuna. If you eat solid white or albacore tuna, limit your intake to 6 ounces per week.Other experts and advocacy groups are even more cautious, expanding the list of fish to avoid. Read more about eating fish when you're breastfeeding. Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.Go easy on the alcoholIf you time it right, an occasional drink probably won't harm your breastfeeding baby, but in general you may want to hold off on drinking alcohol while you're breastfeeding. Alcohol does enter your breast milk, and having as little as one drink may affect your milk letdown reflex.Studies show that babies consume less milk in the four hours after you have an alcoholic beverage. And your baby may become drowsy and fall asleep more quickly after you have a drink, but he'll also sleep for a shorter amount of time. (And, of course, heavy drinking makes you unable to safely care for your baby.)If you're going to enjoy an occasional alcoholic beverage, keep in mind that it takes two to three hours for your body to eliminate the alcohol in one serving of beer or wine. Specific time frames depend on your size and how much you drink, but the more you drink the longer it takes your body to get rid of it. So you might want to time that toast for right after a feeding session.Alcohol isn't stored in breast milk  instead, the level increases and decreases just as it does in your bloodstream. If you have an alcoholic drink, wait at least two hours before breastfeeding your baby or you may need to ""pump and dump."" If you plan to have a drink with alcohol, either breastfeed your baby or express your milk first and store it for later.If you're a breastfeeding mom who supplements late-night feedings with formula, another option is to wait until your baby goes down for the night before you drink alcohol.Also, drink water with your alcoholic drink, and eat before (or while) you drink to help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk. Drink plenty of water and limit caffeineWhen you're breastfeeding, your body needs plenty of fluid, but there's no need to keep a record of how much you drink. A good guideline to follow is drink to satisfy thirst  that is, drink whenever you feel the need. If your urine is clear or light yellow, it's a good sign that you're well hydrated.Speaking of fluids, it's okay to have your morning cup of coffee while breastfeeding if you like, but don't overdo it. A small amount of caffeine winds up in your breast milk, and it can accumulate in your baby's system because she can't easily break it down and excrete it.Most experts suggest that nursing moms limit their consumption of caffeine (including coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream) to no more than 300 mg per day. That's about as much as you'd get in three 5-ounce cups of coffee. You may want to drink even less if you're nursing a newborn or preterm baby. Check out our caffeine chart to see how much caffeine is in popular beverages and foods.Consider the flavors of what you eat and drinkMost nursing moms can eat a wide variety of foods while nursing  including spicy foods  without any objection from their baby. In fact, some experts believe that babies enjoy a variety of flavors in their breast milk. Eating your favorite foods while you're nursing gives your baby a ""taste"" of your diet and may help him accept different foods once he starts eating solids.But some moms swear that certain foods  like broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, dairy products, chocolate, citrus, garlic, or chili pepper  make their breastfed baby gassy or irritable. If your baby seems consistently uncomfortable after you eat a particular food, then by all means avoid it to see if your baby is happier.In rare instances, your baby may be allergic to something you've eaten. If this is the case, you may notice a reaction on his skin (rash or hives), in his breathing (wheezing or congestion), or in his stools (green or mucousy). Keep taking your vitaminsIt's a good idea to continue taking your prenatal vitamin while you're breastfeeding  at least for the first month or so. After that, you can switch to a regular multivitamin and mineral supplement or stay on your prenatal vitamin, depending on your individual needs. (You can discuss this with your healthcare provider at your first postpartum visit.)A supplement doesn't take the place of a well-balanced diet, but it can provide some extra insurance on those days when taking care of your new baby keeps you from eating as well as you'd like.In addition to your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin, consider taking the following supplements:Calcium: While your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin may have small amounts of calcium, but you'll need supplemental calcium if you're not eating at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods (like milk and other dairy products, canned fish, or calcium-fortified foods like cereals, juices, soy and rice beverages, and breads).The recommended dose for women before, during, and after pregnancy is 1,000 milligrams (mg) daily. (Teenage mothers need 1,300 mg daily.)Don't get more than 2,500 mg daily from all sources. Exceeding this safe upper limit can lead to kidney stones, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency syndrome. It can also interfere with your body's absorption of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc.If you're going to take calcium, also be sure to supplement with vitamin D.Vitamin D: This vitamin is important for bone growth and overall health. Vitamin D also helps your body absorb calcium, and research suggests it may lower the risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, and several autoimmune diseases.Sun exposure helps your body produce vitamin D, but many women don't get enough sun (especially in the winter and with the use of sunscreen) to make an adequate amount, and experts think the small amount found in food might not be enough. The best way to know whether you're getting enough vitamin D is to have your blood tested.The 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine both recommend that all women get 600 IU (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily, but no more than 4,000 IU. Very large amounts of vitamin D  more than 10,000 IU daily  may cause kidney and tissue damage.By the way, breast milk doesn't supply your baby with enough vitamin D. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed or who drink less than 32 ounces of formula daily receive a supplement of 400 IU (10 micrograms) of vitamin D each day too. Talk to your baby's doctor about a vitamin D supplement.Vitamin D is important for bone development and the prevention of rickets in children. Experts think that getting enough vitamin D in childhood may also help prevent certain conditions, like osteoarthritis, from developing later in life.DHA: The DHA content of your breast milk depends on your diet, particularly on whether you eat fish. So if your diet doesn't contain a few servings of cold water fish or other food containing DHA (like fortified eggs) every week, you might consider a supplement.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding moms get 200 to 300 mg of DHA a day.Daily food and meal plans for breastfeeding momsChart of daily food group servings for breastfeeding moms.Sample meal plans for breastfeeding moms.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Cow's milk: When and how to introduce it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-when-and-how-to-introduce-it_1334703.bc,"Why should I wait until my baby is at least 12 months old to introduce cow's milk?Babies can't digest cow's milk as completely or easily as breast milk or formula. Cow's milk contains high concentrations of protein and minerals, which can tax your baby's immature kidneys.Cow's milk doesn't have the right amounts of iron, vitamin C, and other nutrients for infants. It may even cause iron-deficiency anemia in some babies, since cow's milk protein can irritate the lining of the digestive system, leading to blood in the stools. Finally, cow's milk doesn't provide the healthiest types of fat for growing babies.However, once your child's ready to digest it, dairy milk can supplement a balanced diet of solid foods that include cereals, vegetables, fruits and meats.Why should my child start drinking cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. It's also one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. (Almost all milk in the United States is fortified with vitamin D.)Milk also provides protein for growth, and carbohydrates to give your child the energy he needs all day. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosDo I need to stop breastfeeding when my child starts drinking cow's milk?There's no need to wean your child after you introduce cow's milk. As long as you both enjoy breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says it's fine to continue breastfeeding past your child's first birthday.How much milk should my toddler drink?According to the AAP, your 1-year-old can get enough calcium and vitamin D from 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1 1/2 cups) of cow's milk  or the equivalent amount of other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. By age 2, your child should get 16 ounces, or 2 cups, of cow's milk or other milk products each day.However, don't give your child more than 32 ounces (4 cups) of milk a day or she may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out her diet. If your toddler's still thirsty, offer water. Can I give my toddler fat-free or reduced-fat milk?In most cases, not yet. The AAP recommends giving whole milk to 1-year-olds unless they're at high risk for obesity. Children this age need the higher fat content of whole milk to maintain normal weight gain and to help the body absorb vitamins A and D. The concentration of protein and minerals in nonfat milk is also too high for children this age. Once your child turns 2, you may decide to switch him to reduced-fat or nonfat milk as long as he's growing well.Possible exceptions: Your child's doctor may recommend giving your child reduced-fat milk (2 percent) after age 1 if you're overweight or obese, or have a family history of obesity, high cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease.My toddler doesn't seem to want cow's milk. How can I get her to try it?Some toddlers take to cow's milk right away, but others are hesitant to make the switch because it has a different texture, taste, and even temperature than breast milk.If that's the case for your toddler, try mixing cow's milk with some breast milk or formula at first. (Try one part milk to three parts of breast milk or formula.) Then slowly shift the ratio until she's drinking 100 percent milk. It may also help to serve cow's milk at room temperature.It can be a challenge to meet the nutritional recommendations for milk or milk products if your child doesn't care for them. But there are many ways to include these in your child's diet. For example:Add milk to her cereal.Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks.Make soup with milk instead of water.Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child can't tolerate milk or can't have it because we're vegans?Regardless of the reason your child doesn't get calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, your pediatrician will probably recommend either fortified soy milk or calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.However, the AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious health problems.Could my child have a milk allergy?If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that he'll have no problem tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in breast milk (unless you avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)But true allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon: Only 2 to 3 percent of infants are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.) The main symptoms of milk allergy are:Rashes or hives, especially around the mouth or chinAbdominal discomfortDiarrheaVomitingSwellingItchinessAnd chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties could all be signs that a milk allergy is affecting your child's respiratory system. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Take your child to his healthcare provider or to the nearest emergency room immediately if he:Is extremely pale or weakHas hives all over his bodyDevelops swelling in the head or neckHas bloody diarrheaHe may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products. In this case, the label will say ""milk.""Learn more:10 nutrients every child needsShould I monitor how much fat my child eats?Best and worst drinks for thirsty kidsShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Your pregnancy diet: The basics of eating well,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-eating-well,"Fine-tune your diet  even if you already eat wellAlmost all pregnant women need to get more protein, more of certain vitamins and minerals (such as folic acid and iron), and more calories (for energy). If there's room for improvement in your diet, eating highly nutritious meals is one of the best things you can do for your baby's health.But eating better doesn't mean eating a lot. If you start off at a healthy weight, you don't need additional calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you need about 340 extra calories a day and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're underweight or overweight to start, you'll need more or less than this, depending on your weight gain goal.Learn more: Find out the best ways to eat for two and get the calories you need.Skip unsafe foodsSome foods can be dangerous when you're pregnant. Steer clear of these foods:Raw seafood (such as oysters or uncooked sushi)Unpasteurized milk (and cheese made from unpasteurized milk)Soft cheese (such as Brie or Camembert)Mexican cheese (like queso blanco and panela)PtRaw or undercooked meat and poultryAll of these are possible sources of bacteria that can be harmful to an unborn child.Learn more: Find out how to avoid listeriosis, a foodborne illness that's especially dangerous during pregnancy. Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Say no to alcoholYou'll need to give up cocktails, too. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause physical defects, learning disabilities, and emotional problems in children, so many experts recommend that you give up alcohol for your entire pregnancy.Learn more: Discover your favorite nonalcoholic alternative from our list of the best virgin drinks.Limit caffeineCaffeine is another consideration. Aim to get less than 200 milligrams (mg) per day (about 12 ounces of coffee). Some studies suggest a link between higher amounts of caffeine and miscarriage or lower birth weight, but this hasn't been confirmed. Just in case, stick to decaffeinated tea and sodas, or choose healthier drinks, such as skim milk, 100 percent fruit juice, or water with a squeeze of lemon.Learn more: Be informed about caffeine during pregnancy and see how much caffeine there is in common beverages and foods.Go easy on fishNearly all fish contain traces of methylmercury, a metal believed to be harmful in high doses to the growing brains of fetuses and young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends limiting your consumption of fish to 12 ounces a week, which is the equivalent of about two servings.Learn more: Get the facts about eating fish during pregnancy and find answers to all your food safety questions.Take a prenatal vitaminEven without morning sickness or food aversions, it's difficult to meet your nutritional needs with just a well-balanced diet. A prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement helps you get the nutrients you and your baby need to thrive.Make sure the prenatal vitamin you choose contains folic acid. (You need 400 mcg daily before you become pregnant and in early pregnancy. Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg once you're pregnant.) Not getting enough folic acid has been linked to neural tube birth defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to take other supplementsCholine is another important nutrient that researchers now believe may help prevent NTDs. You need 450 mg of choline a day during pregnancy. Most prenatal vitamins don't contain it, so you'll have to get it from food or ask your healthcare provider about taking a choline supplement.Later in your pregnancy your provider may suggest that you take iron or calcium supplements to make sure you're getting enough of these key minerals. Some experts also recommend taking a vitamin D supplement throughout pregnancy.If you're a strict vegetarian, have a medical condition such as diabetes, gestational diabetes, or anemia, or have previously delivered a low-birth-weight baby, talk with your healthcare provider about other supplements you might need. A registered dietitian can also help with diet specifics.If you have trouble swallowing your vitamins or keeping them down, search for a chewable supplement or one in a powdered form that you can mix with water. And keep in mind that more isn't always better: Don't take megadoses of any vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement without medical supervision  they could harm your developing baby.Learn more: See our chart of nutrients you need to help your baby grow.Don't diet while you're pregnantDieting during pregnancy could be harmful to you and your baby. Many eating plans designed for weight loss would leave you low not only on calories, but also on iron, folic acid, and other important vitamins and minerals.Weight gain is one of the most positive signs of a healthy pregnancy. Women who eat well and gain the& appropriate amount of weight are more likely to have healthy babies. If you're eating wholesome foods and slowly adding pounds, you can rest assured things are most likely on track.Keep in mind that when you put on your pregnancy weight may be as important as how much you gain. Healthcare providers recommend that you gain the least weight during the first trimester  roughly 1 to 5 pounds  and then gain roughly a pound a week in the second and third trimesters. (Talk with your provider if you're carrying twins or if you're underweight or overweight at the start of pregnancy  your recommended rate of weight gain might be different.)Learn more: Find out what eating for two really means. Eat small meals frequentlyIt's fine to get creative with your eating schedule during pregnancy. If nausea, food aversions, heartburn, or indigestion make eating full-size meals uncomfortable, try eating small, frequent meals throughout the day. As your pregnancy progresses and your baby increasingly crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, you'll have less space in your body for big meals anyway.If you're most hungry when it's not typically time to eat, go ahead and have your meal when the feeling strikes. Eating in a pattern that works for you will help you meet your nutritional needs during pregnancy.(Snacks in between meals are fine, but make healthy choices as often as you can  junk food offers little more than empty calories.)Learn more: Create a pregnancy meal plan you can live with.Treat yourself to something sweet on occasionAvoid making processed foods, packaged snacks, and sugary desserts the mainstay of your diet, but you don't have to give up all your favorite goodies just because you're pregnant. Try smart and tasty alternatives such as a banana smoothie, frozen all-fruit nonfat sorbet, or trail mix.And don't beat yourself up if you cave in to temptation now and again. The occasional cookie or piece of cake won't do any harm.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Pregnant and underweight: How to get the nutrients you need,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-and-underweight-how-to-get-the-nutrients-you-need_1313894.bc,"How many pounds should I gain during pregnancy?Most women who start off their pregnancies underweight are advised to gain between 28 and 40 pounds  a bit more than the standard recommendation of 25 to 35 pounds. The March of Dimes suggests that if you begin your pregnancy underweight you try to gain slightly over a pound a week in the second and third trimesters (assuming you gain between 1 and 4 1/2 pounds in the first trimester).However, your doctor or midwife may make a different recommendation based on your individual situation, particularly if you have a history of eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.If you need help gaining the extra weight, seek out a registered dietitian. (Ask your healthcare provider for a recommendation.)Not sure if you were underweight before you were pregnant? View a body mass index (BMI) chart to find out. You're considered underweight if you have a BMI of less than 18.5. (Your BMI reflects the relationship between your height and weight.)Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Does being underweight pose any risks to my baby or me?If you're underweight at the start of your pregnancy, you have a greater risk of having a preterm birth or a small for gestational age (SGA) baby. This puts the baby at risk for a host of problems. However, gaining enough weight  and gaining consistently throughout your pregnancy  reduces this risk.How can I make sure I'm getting all the nutrients I need?To begin with, like all pregnant women, you need to be taking a folic acid supplement to reduce your baby's risk of a neural tube defect. In fact, experts recommend taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day, beginning at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant. Some experts advise raising the dose to at least 600 mcg per day once you're pregnant.Other than that, the bulk of your nourishment should come from whole foods, but a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement can help make up for some shortcomings. Your doctor or midwife will probably recommend that you start taking one as soon as you find out you're pregnant, if not before.If you're not sure you can stick to a healthy diet on your own, a registered dietitian can help you come up with a sensible meal plan and even provide you with simple recipes that include the foods rich in the vitamins and minerals that are essential to a healthy baby.Use our handy pregnancy food diary to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day. The diary is also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels, so you can spot patterns you may need to change.How can I stay on track with weight gain?Choose plenty of nutritious foods that contain some healthy fat and adequate calories. Here are four easy ways to get more calories:Eat breakfast every day. Add some peanut butter or a slice of cheese to your morning toast for an extra protein boost.Add a couple of slices of avocado and a handful of nuts or seeds to your salads for extra protein and healthy fat.Eat two or three snacks between meals. Choose foods like yogurt (for protein and calcium), dried fruit (for vitamins, minerals, and fiber), or a fruit and yogurt smoothie (for protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals).Replace soda with milk (for protein and calcium) or juices that are high in vitamin C or beta carotene, an antioxidant. Grapefruit juice, orange juice, and papaya nectar are rich in vitamin C. Apricot nectar and carrot juice have lots of beta carotene.Show sources Hide sources Kanadys WM. 2007.

Nutrition guidelines for young children (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_nutrition-guidelines-for-young-children-ages-5-to-8_66921.bc,"Most school-aged children develop curiosity about food and new eating habits as they grow. While certain foods are essential, every child has unique dietary needs and preferences. To make sure your child gets enough of all the right stuff, see these tips for healthy snacks and meals, and follow the guidelines below.Nutrition for big kidsOffer your child foods from all five major food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and protein) at every meal. You may not always be able to get him to eat the recommended amount from each group every day, but if you serve a variety of healthy food, he'll eventually get what he needs over the course of a week.GrainsGrains contain fiber, which aids digestion, and complex carbohydrates, which provide energy. Grains are also great sources of B vitamins, and some fortified ready-to-eat cereals provide an entire day's worth of many vitamins and minerals.Grains come in two types  whole grains and refined grains. Whole grain products use the entire grain kernel and have more fiber, iron and B vitamins than refined grains. Examples of whole grains are whole wheat flour and bread, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta.Refined grains have been processed to give them a finer texture and a longer shelf life. Refined grain products include white flour and bread, white rice, and most kinds of pasta.Some foods are made from both whole grains and refined grains.The USDA recommends getting at least half of your grains from whole grains.How much big kids need daily: About five ounce equivalents.How much is in an ounce of grains: An ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked pasta or cooked cereal.Examples of the daily requirement:1 cup oatmeal for breakfast, whole wheat bread sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup brown rice for dinner.One whole grain mini bagel for breakfast, five whole wheat crackers for a snack, open faced sandwich for lunch, English muffin pizza for dinner.One whole wheat pancake for breakfast, two rye crispbreads for a snack, grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked bulgur for dinner.VegetablesVegetables provide plenty of fiber, along with vitamins C and A and potassium. In addition, most produce contains antioxidants, disease-fighting substances that may lower the risk of cancer and heart disease later in life.Over the course of a week, try to serve your child lots of different-colored vegetables  dark green broccoli, light green beans, orange carrots, red tomatoes, and so on. That way, you'll be sure he's getting all the nutrients each vegetable has to offer.How much big kids need daily: About 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of vegetables: A cup of vegetables equals 1 cup of cooked or raw vegetables, 2 cups of raw leafy greens, one large tomato, or two medium carrots.Examples of your the daily requirement:1 cup chopped salad greens with 1/4 cup sliced cherry tomatoes for lunch, 1/4 cup cauliflower and 1/4 cup of broccoli trees for snack, and 1/4 cup cooked corn for dinner.1/2 cup low-sodium tomato juice for breakfast, one half baked sweet potato for lunch, and 1/2 cup cooked broccoli trees for dinner.1/2 cup cooked squash for lunch, one half small ear of corn on the cob for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked baby spinach for dinner. FruitFruit also provides plenty of fiber, along with vitamins C and A and potassium. In addition, most produce contains antioxidants, disease-fighting substances that may lower the risk of cancer and heart disease later in life.Serve your child a colorful variety of fruits to be sure he gets as many different nutrients as possible.How much big kids need daily: About 1 to 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of fruit: A cup of fruit equals 1 cup of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit; 1/2 cup dried fruit; one half of a large apple; one 8-inch or 9-inch banana; one medium (4-inch diameter) grapefruit.Examples of the daily requirement:1/2 cup sliced banana for breakfast, 1/4 cup raisins for snack, 1/2 cup sliced strawberries for dessert.Half an apple (sliced) for snack, a quarter of an orange (sectioned) for lunch, 1/4 cup canned peaches for dessert.Half a grapefruit for breakfast, 1/2 cup applesauce for lunch, 1/2 cup sliced berries for dessert.DairyMost dairy products are wonderful sources of calcium, which gives your child strong teeth and bones. They're also excellent sources of protein  good to know if your child doesn't like meat.Once your child is older than 2, make the switch to low-fat or fat-free milk. Your child gets the same amount of calcium and vitamin D, but less solid fat and fewer calories.Solid fats are mainly saturated fat, which raise blood cholesterol levels. Do your child a favor by getting him in the habit of drinking low-fat milk as a youngster.How much big kids need daily: About 2 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of dairy: A cup of dairy can be 1 cup milk, yogurt, or soy milk; 1 1/2 ounces, two slices, or 1/3 cup shredded hard cheese (such as cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, or Parmesan); 2 ounces processed (American) cheese; 1/2 cup ricotta cheese; 2 cups cottage cheese; 1 cup pudding made with milk; or 1 1/2 cups ice cream.Examples of the daily requirement:1/2 cup milk for breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for snack, 1/2 cup milk and one slice cheddar cheese for lunch, 1/2 cup pudding for dessert.1/2 cup milk for breakfast, one slice cheese for snack, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese for dinner.1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese (in eggs or on toast) for breakfast, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/2 cup milk for dinner, 1/2 cup frozen yogurt for dessert. ProteinMeat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, soy products, and nuts and seeds are all protein foods. (Beans and peas are also part of the vegetable food group.) Unless you're raising your child to be vegetarian, try to serve seafood at least twice a week.Choose lean or low-fat meat and poultry, and remove skin from chicken before cooking. Protein foods give your child iron, zinc, and some B vitamins.How much big kids need daily: About four ounce equivalents.How much is in an ounce of protein: An ounce equivalent of protein equals 1 ounce of meat, fish, or poultry; one egg; 1 tablespoon of nut butter; 1/4 cup of cooked beans; 1/8 cup of tofu; and 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds.Examples of the daily requirement:One egg for breakfast, 1 ounce sliced turkey for lunch, 1 ounce cooked ground beef, and 1/4 cup chili beans for dinner.1/4 cup tofu scramble for breakfast, 1 tablespoon peanut butter for lunch, 1/4 cup refried beans for dinner.1 tablespoon nut butter for breakfast, one egg for lunch, 1 ounce roast beef and 1/4 cup cooked lentils for dinner.Oils and fats: Use sparinglyOils aren't considered a separate food group, but they do provide some nutrients necessary for a healthy diet, and they are the major source of vitamin E in the typical American diet. Still, only small amounts of oils are necessary.Oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature, like the vegetable oils used in cooking or salad dressings. Some foods, such as nuts, certain fish, avocados, and olives, are naturally high in oils. (Two tablespoons of peanut butter contain 2 teaspoons of oil.)Most children get all the oils they need in the food they eat or in salad dressings or oils used for cooking. Children 5 to 8 years old need about 4 teaspoons of oil a day."

Iron in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1468.bc,"Why you need iron during pregnancyEven before you're pregnant, your body needs iron for several reasons:It's essential for making hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to other cells.It's an important component of myoglobin (a protein that helps supply oxygen to your muscles), collagen (a protein in bone, cartilage, and other connective tissue), and many enzymes.It helps maintain a healthy immune system.But during pregnancy you need a lot more of this essential mineral. Here's why:The amount of blood in your body increases during pregnancy until you have almost 50 percent more blood than usual. You need extra iron to make more hemoglobin.You need extra iron for your growing baby and placenta, especially in the second and third trimesters.Many women need more because they start their pregnancy with insufficient stores of iron.Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.How much iron you needPregnant women: 27 milligrams (mg) of iron per dayNonpregnant women: 18 mgYou don't have to get the recommended amount of iron every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of ironThere are two forms of iron: heme and non-heme. Heme iron is found only in animal sources and is easier for your body to absorb. Non-heme iron is found in plants, iron-fortified foods, and supplements. Red meat, poultry, and seafood contain both heme and non-heme iron. To make sure you're getting enough, eat a variety of iron-rich foods every day.Red meat, poultry, and fish are some of the best sources of iron. (Liver supplies a very high concentration of iron, but it also contains unsafe amounts of vitamin A, so it's best to limit it to one or two servings a month during pregnancy.) If your diet doesn't include animal protein, you can get iron from legumes, vegetables, and grains.Strawberry and asparagus salad Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 4:02Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -4:02Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Adding just a little meat or fish to a meal helps your body absorb more of the iron in the other foods on your plate.Here are a few more tips for getting as much iron as possible from your diet:Cook in a cast iron pan. Moist, acidic foods, such as tomato sauce, are especially good at soaking up iron this way.Include a source of vitamin C (like orange juice, strawberries, or broccoli) with every meal, especially when eating vegetarian sources of iron, like beans  the vitamin C can help you absorb up to six times more iron.Many healthy foods contain ""iron inhibitors,"" which are naturally occurring substances that can interfere with iron absorption. Examples of iron inhibitors include phytates in whole grains and legumes, polyphenols in coffee and tea, oxalates in soy foods and spinach, and calcium in dairy products.If you have low iron or iron-deficiency anemia, some experts believe you shouldn't eat iron-inhibiting foods at the same time as iron-rich foods. Others believe it's okay to eat these foods together as long as your overall diet includes plenty of iron-rich and vitamin C-rich foods. Your provider or a dietitian can work with you to create a prenatal nutrition plan that supports healthy iron levels.If your provider has prescribed iron supplements, take them one hour before or two hours after meals because iron is absorbed most easily on an empty stomach. Taking the supplement with orange juice  which is high in iron-enhancing vitamin C  can boost absorption. (But don't take your iron pill with milk, coffee, or tea because these can interfere with iron absorption.)Calcium also hinders iron absorption, so if your provider has recommended you take both an iron and a calcium supplement (or antacids that contain calcium), ask for advice on how to space them out during the day.Should you take an iron supplement?Although your body absorbs iron more efficiently during pregnancy, you might not get enough of the mineral from your diet. Many women start their pregnancy without enough iron to meet their body's increased demands and are unable to bring their levels up through diet alone.At your first prenatal appointment, your healthcare provider will probably recommend a prenatal vitamin with about 30 mg of iron. Unless you have (or develop) anemia, this should be sufficient, so don't take additional supplements unless your provider advises you to.What happens if you don't get enough ironWhen you don't get enough iron, your stores become depleted over time. And if you no longer have enough iron to make the hemoglobin you need, you become anemic.Iron-deficiency anemia can sap your energy and cause many other symptoms, especially if you have a severe case. It can also make it harder for your body to fight infection.It may even impact your pregnancy: Iron-deficiency anemia  especially in early or midpregnancy  has been linked to a greater risk of preterm birth, having a low-birth-weight baby, and fetal or newborn death. See our complete article on iron-deficiency anemia.If you're anemic when you give birth, you're more likely to need a transfusion and have other problems if you lose a lot of blood at delivery. And some research suggests an association between maternal iron deficiency and postpartum depression.Your baby does a good job of taking care of his iron needs while he's in your uterus. He'll get his share of what's available before you do. That said, if you're severely anemic, it may compromise your baby's iron stores at birth, raising his risk for anemia later in infancy and possibly hurting his growth and cognitive development.Can you get too much iron?Yes. Aim to get no more than 45 milligrams of iron a day. If you take more than that (either from an extra iron supplement or from your prenatal vitamin), it can cause your blood levels of iron to rise too high, possibly causing problems for you and your baby.For example, too much iron can increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes or oxidative stress, an imbalance in the body that's thought to play a role in infertility, preeclampsia, and miscarriage, and has been linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Take iron supplements during pregnancy only under the supervision of your healthcare provider.Side effects of iron supplementsIron supplements can upset your gastrointestinal tract. The most common complaint is constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. Try drinking prune juice if you're constipated. It can help you stay regular  and is actually a good source of iron!You may also have nausea or (more rarely) diarrhea. If your supplement makes you feel queasy, try taking it with a small snack or at bedtime.Talk to your provider if you're experiencing other side effects  if you're not anemic and your prenatal vitamin has more than 30 mg of iron, it may make sense for you to switch to one with a lower dose.If you are anemic, you may be able to prevent stomach problems by starting with a supplement that has less iron and gradually building up to the dose you need. You could also try taking the iron in smaller doses throughout the day. Your provider may suggest trying different iron supplements to find one that's easy on your stomach. For example, some moms-to-be have fewer side effects from a timed-release iron supplement, although the trade-off is that the iron isn't absorbed as well this way.Finally, don't worry if your stools look darker when you start taking iron. That's a normal and harmless side effect.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

The 10 best foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-10-best-foods-for-babies_10320505.bc,"There are lots of healthy, baby-friendly foods out there, but these 10 recommended by doctors and nutritionists alike stand out from the pack. From vitamin-rich fruits and veggies to meats and beans loaded with protein, these superfoods are full of essential nutrients, reasonably priced, easy to prepare, and delicious.Many are also favorite first foods. Before introducing solids, talk to the pediatrician about your baby's readiness for solids, and which foods to introduce and when. Then introduce foods one at a time, waiting at least three days after each new food to watch for any allergic reaction.AvocadosBabyCenter moms are all about avocado as a first food. This buttery fruit-vegetable is rich in healthy unsaturated fats that help boost brain development. In fact, the fat composition of avocados is somewhat similar to that ofbreast milk.Serving ideas:Mash avocado with a fork, or make baby guacamole.BananasKnown as a good source of potassium, this grab-and-go fruit also contains vitamins B6 and C, calcium, and iron.Serving ideas: Make banana and mango puree. Or, for your little one's first smoothie, puree banana and peach chunks with whole-milk yogurt.BlueberriesBlueberries are bursting with antioxidants. The deep, brilliant blue of these berries comes from flavonoids that benefit your baby's eyes, brain, and even urinary tract.Serving ideas:Blend or mash blueberries well and swirl a spoonful of the juicy purple puree intoyogurt, or top silky coconut milk rice pudding withblueberry compote.5 superfoods and how to serve them to your baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:10Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:10Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Discover creative ways to prepare five different superfoods loaded with the nutrients that every growing baby needs. See all videosBroccoliThis cruciferous vegetable contains fiber, folate, and calcium, and may even help ward off cancer. Introduce your baby tobroccoli's bold flavorearly, and you'll be expanding his tastes and encouraging a lifelong love of green vegetables.Serving idea:Steam until soft, cut into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely, and then chill. Steaming takes the bite out of broccoli, and some babies prefer the texture and taste when it's cold.LentilsBeans and other legumes pack lots of lean protein and fiber. But unlike larger beans, little lentils simmer into a pleasing mush just right for baby bites. They're also one of the cheapest healthy foods you can buy.Serving ideas: Cook finely diced carrots along with the lentils. As your baby gets older, double up on nutrient-rich foods by makinglentil and spinach stew.MeatLack of iron can cause anemia. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends meat as a first food because it's such a great source of protein, zinc, and iron, especially red meat and dark poultry meat. Plus babies absorb iron more easily from meat than from iron-fortified cereals, another common first food.Serving ideas:If your baby is new to solids, try our easyturkey or chicken pureerecipe. As she gets older, introduce new flavors withchicken curry with green beans and zucchiniorshepherd's pie.PrunesWhether you call them ""prunes"" or ""dried plums,"" these humble fruits dont sound glamorous  but they're soft, sweet, and full of fiber. Your baby may suffer fromconstipation when switching to solids, as it's a big change for her system. Add pureed prunes to her diet to aid digestion and keep things moving.Serving ideas: Serve pureed prunes alone or mixed with other foods, such as oatmeal, cereal, or applesauce, for a naturally sweet treat.Sweet potatoesSweet potatoes are one of the more popular first foods for babies, who tend to like both their sweetness and texture. These colorful root vegetables are packed with beta-carotene, vitamin C, and minerals, including iron and copper.Serving ideas: Serve sweet potato puree alone or swirled into pureed chicken or turkey.Winter squashOrange- or yellow-fleshed hard winter squashes such as butternut, acorn, and pumpkin boast many benefits, one of which is they're exceptionally rich in beta-carotene, recognized for being great for eyes. Squash is also an excellent source of vitamin C. Natural sweetness and a creamy texture add to the appeal of winter varieties.Serving ideas: Roast a winter squash like butternut, scoop out the flesh, and puree it for an easy first food. As your baby gets older, introduce new flavors and textures with dishes like smashed chickpea and butternut chili.YogurtCreamyyogurtis rich in calcium and vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones and teeth. Your baby canhave itat 4 to 6 months, long before he'll be ready forcow's milk.Opt for plain yogurt with no added sugar. Also look for a brand with the most live cultures, which help regulate the good bacteria in your baby's digestive tract. Make sure you pick upwhole-milk yogurt babies need the calories from fat.Serving ideas:Yogurt is fine on its own, orswirl in pureed berriesor other fresh fruit, applesauce, or mashed avocado.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

10 energy-boosting foods,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-energy-boosting-foods_10352389.bc,"When your energy is low, it's tempting to give in to cravings for caffeine and sugar  anything to help get you through the day. Instead, choose foods that are rich in protein or fiber to give your body the fuel it needs to keep going. Here are ten of our favorites.EggsAt just 78 calories and 6 grams of protein, the egg is a protein powerhouse. And it's loaded with other nutrients as well, especially in the yolks, says Jonny Bowden, author of The 150 Most Effective Ways to Boost Your Energy. ""People avoid the yolk because they're worried about cholesterol, but egg yolks contain choline, which is critical for memory.""OatmealLoaded with stress-reducing B vitamins and soluble fiber, oatmeal is the perfect choice for an energy boost. Dietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, keeps blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent the overwhelming desire to snooze come 3 p.m. Add a few nutrient-rich berries on top, and you've got the snack of champions.Apples""Not only are fiber-rich apples an excellent choice for a mid-afternoon snack, they're also disease-fighting powerhouses,"" says Pamela Nisevich, sports nutrition consultant at Swim, Bike, Run, Eat! What's more, apples contain boron, a mineral that helps keep you alert.PumpkinPumpkin is loaded with potassium, which helps your heart and muscles function better, says Bowden. Plus, it's packed with fiber (which helps stabilize blood sugar levels) and vitamin A (which helps keep your immune system strong enough to fight off energy-draining infections). Add canned pumpkin to rice for a quick, healthy risotto.SalmonHow many other foods help protect your heart, boost brainpower, and make you feel happy to boot? Salmon is packed with vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 essential fatty acids which research suggests can boost your mood. Plus, its lower in fat and calories than most other protein sources.PeanutsWhile peanuts are high in calories, they're also more filling than other foods, and they naturally curb your calorie intake throughout the day. A study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that when people consumed 500 calories of peanuts daily for 19 weeks, their resting metabolic rate increased by 11 percent  even without added exercise.Trail Mix""Trail mix is quite possibly the world's perfect energy booster,"" says Nisevich. ""It's packed with enough carbs and protein to get you up the trail or over the mountain."" To avoid added sugar and fat, make your own mix with nutrient-rich dried cranberries or apricots and heart-healthy nuts like pistachios and almonds.LentilsThese quick-cooking legumes are a great source of soluble fiber, which gives you steady, slow-burning energy while stabilizing your blood sugar. That fiber  along with folate and magnesium  also helps protect your heart. Finally, lentils are a healthy source of iron, a nutrient you need more of when you're pregnant or lactating. Serve them with whole grains for a complete protein  meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids.YogurtYogurt boasts higher concentrations of protein, calcium, and vitamin D than milk. Plus many brands of yogurt have live active cultures, which can aid digestion. Try organic or Greek yogurt since it's less likely to be loaded with artificial ingredients, sugar, and preservatives.HummusThis yummy spread is made from chickpeas, sesame seeds, lemon, and olive oil. It's a great source of protein and fiber, as well as iron, vitamin C, and folate. Use it as a dip for carrots, peppers, and whole wheat pita strips."
Meal planning during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_meal-planning-during-pregnancy_1352495.bc,"It's easy to feel overwhelmed by pregnancy nutrition advice and worry that your diet will never measure up. But eating well when you're pregnant doesn't need to be difficult: A few simple, online tools can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you and your baby need.Here's a look at general nutrition guidelines and how you can use them to plan meals during your pregnancy.MyPlateYou may remember the Food Guide Pyramid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which outlined how many daily servings you should eat from different categories of food. That pyramid has been adapted to become MyPlate, a system for choosing healthy food based on the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.The site even has a section onhealth and nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, featuring a personalized tracking system that suggests meal plans based on your age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, and trimester.MyPlate divides food into five main groups  grains, fruit, vegetables, protein, and dairy  plus oils. To get an individualized meal plan with general guidelines on what to choose from each group, enter your information at ChooseMyPlate.gov.A sample MyPlate planHere's a quick look at the MyPlate food groups and what a customized plan might recommend.This sample plan is designed for a 32-year-old woman who is 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighed 130 pounds before she got pregnant, is in her second trimester, and gets less than 30 minutes of daily physical activity. (Of course, your plan may be very different.)Grains: 7 ounces a dayGenerally, an ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, one small corn or flour tortilla, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice, or pasta. Get at least half of your daily grains from whole grains (like whole wheat bread or brown rice). Whole grains contain the most fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.Fruits: 2 cups a dayVary the color of the fruit you eat, and choose fresh over frozen or canned whenever possible. Many packaged varieties are preserved in sugary liquid, so choose products without added sugar.Bonus: The fiber in fruit helps prevent hemorrhoidsandconstipation, two common side effects of pregnancy.Vegetables: 3 cups a dayFresh vegetables taste better than canned or frozen, and they're also a better choice if you want to limit sodium and avoid preservatives. But when it comes to fiber and vitamins, plain canned and frozen veggies are just as nutritious as fresh. For maximum nutrition, vary the color of the vegetables you choose. Broccoli, for example, is packed with folate, calcium, and B vitamins. Sweet potatoes provide vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber.Meat and beans: 6 ounces a dayThis equals about two servings that are each about the size of a deck of cards. Choose lean meat and limitfishto 12 ounces per week. (More than that may expose your baby to potentially harmful levels of mercury.)Dairy: 3 cups a dayIn the MyPlate plan, 1 cup of dairy equals 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese, and 2 ounces of processed cheese. In general, dairy products are a great source of calcium and protein.Fats and oils: 6 teaspoons a dayThe best sources include canola oil, olive oil, safflower oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives. Note: An avocado is a fruit, but it's included in the oils category because most of its calories come from fat.Discretionary calories: 266 a dayThis MyPlate sample plan budgets 266 ""extra"" calories that you use how you like, but you must include them in your daily calorie budget. In other words, you could have a scoop of ice cream or put some sugar in your decaf iced tea, but these discretionary calories count toward your daily total (2,200 in this case). How it all adds upOnce you've created your daily food plan, don't try to hit exact numbers in each category. Instead, shoot for an average that's in the desired range over the course of a week or so.As your pregnancy progresses, you'll need to eat a little more because your nutrition needs changeduring the different stages of pregnancy.If you eat roughly the amount recommended for each food group, take a prenatal vitamin daily, and consistently gain a reasonable amount of weight (about a pound per week in the second and third trimesters), you and your baby will be well nourished.The Harvard Healthy Eating PlateNot everyone agrees that the USDA's MyPlate is the best model for good nutrition. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have created their own eating guide, called theHealthy Eating Plate, which they believe better reflects current research on a balanced diet.The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate puts greater emphasis on whole grain foods, recommends healthy vegetable oils, and encourages limiting milk and dairy products to one or two servings a day. It also suggests limiting red meat (and avoiding processed meat altogether) and refined grains, such as white bread and white rice.The Healthy Eating Plate also encourages drinking plenty of water and skipping sugary drinks, and highlights the importance of daily exercise.Harvard's plan encourages you to eat more vegetables because most Americans don't eat enough from this important food group. One exception: Unlike the USDA's MyPlate, the Healthy Eating Plate does not include potatoes in its list of recommended vegetables. That's because potatoes are full of rapidly digested starch and have the same effect on blood sugar as sweets.Which model is best to follow during pregnancy?You can't go wrong with either version. Because experts don't completely agree, you can expect to find slight variations in their recommendations, but the two plans have plenty in common.Even if you can't follow either program to the letter, each gives you something to strive for, says Alan R. Fleischman, neonatologist and medical director of the March of Dimes. Eating nutritiously during pregnancy can pay huge dividends for the rest of your baby's life.""We know that some simple dietary changes can greatly improve the chances of having a healthy baby. For example, consuming 400 micrograms of the B vitaminfolic acidevery day before pregnancy begins and during early pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of a serious birth defect of the brain and spine,"" says Fleischman. ""Poor nutrition during pregnancy has lifelong effects on the growth and development of your baby. It's more important to eat wisely during pregnancy than practically any other time in life.""Do these food guidelines always apply?There are five exceptions to the guidelines. If any of these apply to you, or if you have other concerns, talk to your healthcare provider about your personal nutritional needs.If you're significantlyoverweight, you might do better with fewer calories, but talk to your provider to make sure you're getting the nutrients your baby needs.If you're significantlyunderweight, you'll need to get more calories.If you're a teenager, you'll also need more.If you're expectingmultiples, you'll have additional nutrition needs.If you developgestational diabetesor have pre-existing diabetes, a registered dietitian can help you plan your diet. It will emphasize eating whole foods and getting a consistent amount of carbohydrates at each meal. You'll also need to monitor your blood sugar levels closely and communicate regularly with your team of healthcare providers.Sample menu for a pregnant womanHere's an example of a daily menu specifically designed for our ""sample mom,"" with a few extra snack suggestions.

How to get your preschooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-preschooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_64318.bc,"Eating well gives your preschooler the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your preschooler involvedA great way to get your preschooler excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers or breakfasts.When you take him food shopping, ask him to hold the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?Show your child how you check for specific ingredients on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Show your child how to color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage his involvement in the kitchenInvite your preschooler to help you in the kitchen. Enlist his help putting toppings on the pizza or vegetables on kabobs. Show him how to wash lettuce and toss a salad. Once he can handle it, help him measure ingredients  an excellent foundation for learning fractions! Make meals and snacks funArrange carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers to look like a face on your preschooler's plate. Make pancakes in the shape of his initials and cut toast into a heart shape. Offer yogurt or low-fat salad dressing for him to dip pretzels, vegetables, or fruit slices in, and outfit him with a lively placemat and dinnerware. Go to the sourceTake your preschooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio. A study published in 2007 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association shows that preschoolers in rural areas are more likely to eat more fruits and veggies if they're grown at home.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your preschooler's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your preschooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your preschooler won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. It can also lead to tooth decay, especially if your child carries around a sippy cup all day long.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day, and use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his requirement. When he's thirsty, offer him water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your preschooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your child's nutritional needs, but don't worry about them. It's not hard to meet a preschooler's daily requirements. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:One tablespoon of peanut butter on one slice of whole wheat bread and an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk provides plenty of nutrition. Before the age of 4, this menu will fulfill all of your preschooler's protein requirement, one third of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his daily dairy, 65 percent of his need for zinc, 32 percent of vitamin E, 18 percent of iron, and 65 percent of his calcium needs. For a 4-year-old, it will fulfill 77 percent of his protein needs, 20 percent of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his dairy, 39 percent of zinc, 28 percent of vitamin E, 13 percent of iron, and 41 percent of his calcium needs.A bowl of bran cereal with raisins (three-quarters cup cereal with three-quarters cup low-fat milk) and half a cup of orange juice will provide an excellent start to a preschooler's day. Before age 4, this menu will fulfill half of your preschooler's fruit recommendation and almost half of his dairy needs, a third of his grain recommendation, 81 percent of protein, 51 percent of iron, 63 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily need for vitamin C. Once he's 4 years old, it will fulfill a third of his fruit and almost half his dairy requirements, 20 percent of his grain, 56 percent of his protein, 36 percent of his iron, 38 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily vitamin C needs.If your preschooler is younger than 4, one slice of cheese pizza will provide 89 percent of his protein, 28 percent of his calcium, 35 percent of his iron, and 22 percent of his vitamin A needs for the day. Once he's 4 years old, a slice of cheese pizza will fulfill 61 percent of his protein needs, 18 percent of his calcium, 24 percent of his iron, and 16 percent of his daily need for vitamin A. Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger but choose apple slices or carrot sticks instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your preschooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food."
10 healthy snacks for pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-healthy-snacks-for-pregnancy_10396237.bc,"You had a hearty breakfast before you left for work an hour ago, but your stomach is already growling. Sound familiar? Pregnancy can ramp up your appetite significantly.The challenge is that you get only a limited number of ""extra"" calories per day to play with, but they need to be nutrition-dense.We've put together our top 10 snacks for moms-to-be. They all help meet your need for essential pregnancy nutrients, are easy to assemble, are generously sized, and clock in between 200 and 300 calories. And they're all tasty, too!1. Apple and cheese1 medium apple with hard cheese like cheddar, Monterey Jack, or SwissMost women don't get enough fiber in their diet to begin with, and pregnancy increases your requirement to about 28 to 30 grams (g) of fiber daily. That can be a tall order when you're dealing with morning sickness in the first trimester (or maybe beyond) or that full and bloated feeling later on. To make sure you're hitting the fiber mark, it's smart to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet, which also help to keep you hydrated.One medium apple has more than 4 g of fiber and is just 95 calories. Apples are pleasantly crunchy and couldnt be more portable. Plus, apple peel is full of pectin, a soluble fiber that may improve digestive health.Another must-have pregnancy nutrient is calcium. Moms-to-be need 1,000 milligrams (mg) of this mineral each day. Not only is calcium necessary for keeping your bones and teeth strong, it's essential for your baby's bone structure. And if you don't get enough through the foods you eat or a supplement, your growing baby will take it from your bones. Note: Prenatal vitamins  though packed with other important nutrients  typically don't contain much calcium, so don't count on yours to meet this need.Each 1-ounce slice of cheddar cheese has 200 mg of calcium, netting you 20 percent of your daily requirement. Each slice is about 110 calories and 9 g of fat, so stick to one or two slices.2. Egg on an English muffin1 egg (scrambled or fried) on an English muffin or toastYou've probably been reading lots in the news about vitamin D. It helps calcium get absorbed in the body, and it has been linked to preventing cancer, boosting immunity, and reducing inflammation.During pregnancy it's vital to get enough vitamin D to help support your baby's growing bones and teeth, and to make sure your little one's immune system functions properly outside the womb. Pregnant women need 600 IU of vitamin D daily. Up to 4,000 IU per day is safe, according to the Institute of Medicine.One egg serves up 20 IU of vitamin D. The vitamin D is in the egg yolk, so don't ditch the yolk but do make sure it's cooked through! Other good sources are fortified milk (98 IU per 8 ounces), salmon (360 IU per 3.5 ounces), and canned tuna (200 IU per 3 ounces).Egg yolks also contain choline, which is essential for your little one's developing brain and can help prevent birth defects. You need 450 mg daily of choline, and you can knock out 125 mg with just one egg.3. Homemade trail mix1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup dried tart cherries, 1/2 cup raw almonds, and 1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks (makes 2 cups; 1/2 cup = 1 serving)or1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, 1/2 cup dried diced mango, and 1/2 cup cashews (makes 2 cups; 1/2 cup = 1 serving)Note: Store the trail mix in the fridge or freezer to keep it fresh.There are many varieties of trail mix you can make, but these recipes offer a tasty mix of pregnancy boosters containing calcium, vitamin D, and the mineral magnesium, which helps build bones and teeth. Moms-to-be need about 300 mg of magnesium daily (depending on their age), and pumpkin seeds offer that amount in just a quarter of a cup. Other good sources of magnesium include cooked spinach, black beans, and Brazil nuts.Trouble drifting off at night? Most women find it hard to sleep at some point in their pregnancy. Dried tart cherries contain naturally occurring melatonin, which may improve the quality and duration of sleep. Try mixing them into your trail mix or cereal for a bedtime snack.Dark chocolate contains heart-protective cocoa flavanols and has been shown to help lower blood pressure. Plus, it contains small amounts of the bone-building minerals magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, and phosphorus.Make sure to include almonds in your diet  especially if you're not big on dairy products. Per ounce, almonds contain 76 mg of calcium, plus 1 mg of iron and 3.5 g of fiber. And the fat they contain is almost all heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Snack on them whole, or use them atop yogurt, oatmeal, and salads. Homemade granola with yogurtGranola and yogurt are perfect as a quick snack or breakfast on the go.4. Greek yogurt parfaitA small container of plain Greek yogurt topped with 1 cup blueberries and 2 tablespoons chopped walnutsThere are many reasons why Greek yogurt has become the star of the dairy aisle. It's loaded with protein (it requires twice as much milk to make), boasting about 14 g of protein per 5.3-ounce single-serving container. For the same reason, it provides 15 percent of your daily calcium requirement. It also contains probiotics, which help you maintain a healthy digestive system. All that, plus a smooth and creamy texture that makes even nonfat taste decadent.Topping Greek yogurt with fresh blueberries adds nearly 4 g of fiber and only 84 calories, plus an antioxidant boost. Two tablespoons of chopped walnuts (half an ounce) adds 93 calories, 1 g of fiber, and healthy omega-3 fats. Walnuts also contain the B vitamin biotin, which helps you get energy from the food you eat.5. Veggies or chips and guacamole1/2 cup cucumber slices, 1/2 cup carrots, and 1/2 cup celery sticks with 1/4 cup guacamoleor1 ounce (about 10 chips) of lower sodium tortilla chips with 1/4 cup guacamoleMost women have some swelling in their hands, feet, ankles, and calves at some point in their pregnancy. Avoiding excess sodium will help you beat the bloat. When you've consumed too much salt, your body holds on to more water to help keep the sodium levels in your body balanced. Drinking more water and eating food with a high water content will help you flush the excess salt from your system.Both cucumber and celery are low in calories and contain a lot of water (96 and 95 percent respectively; carrots are 87 percent water). And guacamole is packed with potassium, a vital mineral that helps maintain fluid and electrolyte balance in your body's cells. Make your own to control the sodium mash a ripe avocado with the juice of a lime, then stir in some chopped red onion and cilantro.If you really love your guac with tortilla chips, look for chips with less than 100 mg of sodium per 1 ounce serving.6. Cottage cheese, fruit, and granolaA small bowl of 1 percent-fat cottage cheese topped with 1 cup of diced mango and 2 tablespoons of high-fiber granolaA snack-size cup of cottage cheese (4 ounces) nets you 69 mg of calcium and 14 g of protein for just 81 calories. Mix it with 1 cup of bright, juicy mango and you'll get the added bonus of 71 micrograms (mcg) folate, a B vitamin that plays a key role in the development of your baby's spinal cord and nerves.During pregnancy you need 600 mcg of folic acid/folate daily. Of course your prenatal vitamin will include folic acid, but folate from food sources is beneficial too. One cup of fresh mango also contains almost 3 g of fiber to help combat constipation. Other high-fiber fruits include apples, pears, and oranges.Many types of store-bought granola are high in sugar and don't have a lot of fiber. Look for one with at least 3 g of fiber per 1/3 cup serving and no more than 9 g of sugar.7. Mashed avocado on crackersHalf an avocado spread onto 1 slice of rye crisp bread or crackersIf you've been plagued by leg cramps during your pregnancy, it's time to eat more avocado. A lack of potassium can cause leg muscles to cramp. And as mentioned above, avocado is a potassium powerhouse. (Half of this creamy, delicious fruit contains 345 mg of potassium, 114 calories, and nearly 5 g of fiber.) During pregnancy you need 4,700 mg of the mineral each day, which sounds like a shocking amount, but most fruits and vegetables contain at least some potassium.Keep up with your fiber needs by noshing on whole-grain, low-sodium crackers or rye crisp bread, which offers up nearly 2 g fiber per 37-calorie cracker.8. Tortilla with hummus and tomatoes1 whole-grain tortilla or pita, 1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes, and 1/4 cup hummusFor something savory in that stretch between lunch and dinner, grab a whole-grain tortilla or pita and load in halved cherry tomatoes and hummus. Tomatoes are super low-cal (just 25 calories per cup) and have a substantial amount of beta-carotene, which is important for a healthy immune system.Hummus packs just over 100 calories per 1/4 cup and provides 3 g of protein, 2 g fiber, and nearly 1 mg of iron, helping you reach your daily goal of 27 mg per day.9. Toaster waffle with almond butter and pear1 toasted, whole-wheat frozen waffle or slice of whole-wheat toast topped with 2 tablespoons almond butter and sliced pearSometimes you just need something to satisfy your sweet tooth. Pump up the nutrition of a frozen waffle or toast by smearing it with natural almond butter, which has no added sugar. Almond butter offers 3 g of protein and more than 1.5 g of fiber in each 98-calorie tablespoon. Layer pear or apple slices on top for some natural sweetness and extra fiber.10. Melon with limeWatermelon or other melon with a squeeze of limeWatermelon is 92 percent water, so it'll help you stay hydrated during pregnancy while also providing a sweet treat. And each cup of diced watermelon has 170 mg of potassium. You can also make homemade watermelon juice by blending it with some fresh lime or lemon juice and then straining the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. Then just chill and sip!Frances Largeman-Roth is a nationally recognized nutrition expert and bestselling author.

10 ways to make your pregnancy pounds pay off,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-ways-to-make-your-pregnancy-pounds-pay-off_10396238.bc,"Pregnancy gives you a very important reason to gain weight: To nourish a baby and keep yourself healthy, you'll need additional calories, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.(You can find out how much food you need every day in our article on meal planning during pregnancy.)But what's the healthiest way to do that, while maximizing nutrition and avoiding the bad stuff?1. Dont cut out fatsThe key is to choose nutritious ones. After all, the fat in a doughnut and the fat in an avocado are not created equal. As much as you can, pick healthy fats; the avocado's monounsaturated fats are a lot better than the saturated or trans fats found in a doughnut or pastryand it has vitamins C and K, as well.Eating healthy fats will have a positive impact that lasts beyond pregnancy, says Bridget Swinney, a registered dietitian in Texas and author ofEating Expectantly: Practical Advice for Healthy Eating Before, During, and After Pregnancy.""Your body will store some of the fat you eat to use in your breast milk. For the healthiest breast milk, limit saturated and trans fats now and while you're breastfeeding,"" Swinney says. Find out more about healthy fats pregnant women need and where to get them.2. Choose foods that pack a nutritional punchEat foods that give you more for every bite, like yogurt, which contains calcium, potassium, and protein, and is also a powerful source of probioticsthe good bacteria that helps keep digestion healthy.Other great picks are berries like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and cranberries. These are rich in vitamin C and fiber, but they're also packed with antioxidants, which help fight inflammation.Mushrooms are another nutritional star, says Swinney.""Mushrooms are a good source of minerals like selenium and copper, and they're also the only natural vegetarian source of vitamin D,"" Swinney says. ""Some contain the daily value in one serving.""Find out more about the best foods for pregnant women.3. Eat the whole spectrumTo make sure you're getting a broad range of nutrients, try to load up on colorful fruits and vegetables as often as possible.Try dark green kale, ruby red strawberries, and orange squash. Swinney encourages pregnant women to aim for three cups of vegetables and two cups of fruit each day.In fact, fruits and veggies should fill half your plate at every meal, according to new guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).(Want more info? The USDA offers a customized eating plan for moms-to-be that corresponds to your stage of pregnancy.)And while it's often true that the deeper the color, the more nutritious the veggie, that's not always the case. Vegetables such as cauliflower and cabbage are full of nutrients.So are white potatoes, which often get a bad rap. A medium potato has only 110 calories and provides more than a third of the daily vitamin C needed during pregnancy, plus 2 grams of fiber. (Sweet potatoes are extremely rich in beta carotene but boast less vitamin C.) All the more reason to bake one up, add toppings, and call it lunch or dinner.The dietary danger lurks in the serving size and the preparation: its news to no one that French fries  whether they're made from sweet or white potatoes  are high in fat and saltnot too mention temptingly easy to overindulge in.Nutty brown also counts; try whole wheat breads or pasta to maximize your nutrients. If youre already used to brown rice and whole-grain oatmeal, consider trying some new grains like bulgur and millet.4. Pair foods to maximize their goodnessSome foods are even better together. No, we're not talking about peanut butter and jelly (though that can be a tasty, healthy snack), but rather about foods that enhance each other's nutritional benefits.For example, foods rich in vitamin C  like citrus fruit, melon, berries, broccoli, cabbage, and tomatoes help your body absorb the iron from beans, grains, and eggs. So spoon salsa on your scrambled eggs or black bean tacos, or serve them with a side of melon or steamed broccoli.Or try pairing a prebiotic food with a probiotic food to boost the effects of both. Prebiotics (such as bananas, artichokes, asparagus, onions, and whole grains) encourage the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut, while probiotics like yogurt, kefir, aged cheese, sauerkraut, miso, and tempeh contain gut-healthy bacteria alreadyso one supports the other. Some winning combinations: yogurt with banana, artichoke hearts drizzled with a Greek yogurt sauce, or diced asparagus in miso soup.5. Cook from scratch when you canBy making meals at home, you can control the ingredients, and you'll wind up with better quality, often for less money. For example, many store-bought salad dressings use less expensive  and less healthy  oils than those you'd use at home.One idea: Make your own olive oil-based salad dressing to pour over a spinach or kale salad, then add avocado. Olive oil and avocado help your body absorb more lutein, which is important for eye and brain health, and beta carotene, important for the immune system.Many people are intimidated by cooking fish, but it can be a snap. Cover a slab of salmon with some pesto sauce or olive oil, salt, and pepper, and cook in the microwave for about 3 to 5 minutes or the oven for 12 to 15 minutes at 450 degrees. Salmon has omega-3 fats that help build your baby's brain and eyes.You can also make sweets like quick breads or cookies at home using healthier fats (canola oil or mashed avocado) and less sugar. (You can usually cut the sugar in a recipe by a third without noticing.) Try replacing some of the oil with high-fiber foods like black beans or prunes. And sneak in some extra nutrients by adding dried fruits and nuts.6. Rethink your drinksIt's important to stay hydrated during pregnancy, but how you do it can make a big difference. Steer clear of soda, sweet tea, and sugary fruit drinks and juices  they're full of empty calories. Water, milk, or vegetable juice are better choices.Drinking one-hundred100 percent juice (without added sweeteners) can be a great way to get one serving of fruit. Juice has a lot of natural sugars and calories, though, so limit your intake to one cup a day.Pick juices with powerful nutrients. Cranberry juice may help prevent urinary tract infections; apple juice contains phytochemicals linked to improved respiratory health; and orange juice is rich in vitamin C, potassium, and folic acid, which are important for your babys development.If plain water doesn't appeal, try a spritzer: Pour sparkling water into a glass and add a splash of fruit juice or pureed fruit (watermelon and mint tastes great).7. Embrace eggsThey're cheap, easy to prepare, and great for your baby. A large egg is roughly 80 calories, over half of which comes from the yolk. Speaking of which, if you've been an egg-white omelet aficionada until now, pregnancy is a time to rethink that. Both the egg yolk and the white contain healthy lean protein.And yolks are packed with vitamins such as choline, which is important for your baby's developing brain  and may help your memory, too.""When I was pregnant, I added a hard-boiled egg a day as a snack,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""Eggs might contain a little cholesterol, but they're full of nutrients and an easy, affordable way to get choline into your diet.""8. Break out the beansPacked with protein and dirt cheap, beans can be a meal unto themselves. To make a big pot, soak dried beans overnight in water; drain the next day; add water to cover; and toss in garlic, onion, and spices; then cook until tender. Add them to a salad, combine them with rice, or team with a portion of meat for a well-balanced meal.""Beans have protein, fiber, carbs, and no fat unless it's added,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women. ""They have great iron content and they're really filling.""Legumes include beans, peas, and lentils, and there are so many varieties, you can't get tired of them,"" says Kaidanian.9. Choose treats that add valueBreak out the dark chocolate. Though it does contain sugar and fat, it shouldn't be on your ""unhealthy"" list, says nutritionist Bridget Swinney. ""Chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains antioxidants that may actually help blood pressure,"" she says.Still, Swinney advises sticking to small amounts. She recommends 1 to 2 tablespoons of cocoa or half an ounce of dark chocolate a day. (That's about what you'd get in a cup of hot cocoa, three dark Hershey Kisses, or one and a half Dove Promises.)Another healthy splurge: dark chocolate-covered almonds. Just 11 contain 25 percent of your vitamin E for the day.Or go for frozen yogurt or low-fat ice cream, which contains protein and calcium. Punch up the nutrition by topping it with sliced banana and slivered almonds.10. Snack smartSnacking and pregnancy are a good fit: Having smaller, more-frequent meals or snacks can help ward off morning sickness, indigestion, and heartburn. And healthy snacking provides a steady stream of nutrients to your developing baby.But don't let regular snacking morph into all-day eating. Brush up on how much extra you need to be eating, which may be a lot less than you think.""To stick to a well-balanced weight, pregnant women don't have to eat much more,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the NYU Maternal Fetal Care Center.You can often get the extra calories you need in one healthy snack  yogurt with fruit, cheese and crackers, apples and peanut butter. ""Not a hot fudge sundae,"" Roman says.Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood."
Is it safe to take isotretinoin (Accutane) for acne while I'm pregnant?,https://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe-to-take-isotretinoin-accutane-for-acne-while-im-p_9399.bc,
Pregnancy medicine cabinet checklist,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnancy-medicine-cabinet-checklist_10333161.bc,"Now that you're expecting, your medicine cabinet probably looks a little different. (Goodbye birth control, hello hemorrhoid cream.) Find out all about the products you might need, and which are safe, during pregnancy. Take a printable version with you.Heavy-duty moisturizerSoothe the itch of stretching skin with a rich oil or lotion. If your skin  or sense of smell  is extra sensitive these days, go for a scent-free product. For an even bigger aaaah factor, chill the moisturizer in the fridge.Soft toothbrush and good flossSoaring progesterone levels make your gums more sensitive and prone to pregnancy gingivitis. Unchecked gingivitis can turn into periodontitis, a much more serious gum disease, so you'll want to give your gums thorough but tender care, with an extra-soft toothbrush.Daily flossing is your second weapon against pregnancy gingivitis. If flossing your back teeth triggers a hypersensitive gag reflex, try an interdental flosser  these small gadgets help you get between teeth without putting your fingers in the back of your mouth.Panty liners and breast padsNot all women need them, but panty liners discreetly handle all sorts of pregnancy drips, from heavier vaginal discharge to possible urine leakage when you laugh, cough, or sneeze.Same goes for breast pads: Some expecting moms start leaking colostrum, the antibody-rich first milk, in the last few months of pregnancy. If this happens to you, breast pads can protect your clothes and prevent any awkward wet spots.Morning sickness soothersOne woman's go-to remedy may do nothing to quell your queasiness, so if you're suffering from morning sickness you'll probably need to experiment to find something that works for you. Popular ones to try: ginger candies or tea, pregnancy lollipops and suckers, vitamin B6, and acupressure bands.VitaminsPrenatal vitamins. These contain folic acid and iron, two nutrients that are important for pregnancy but hard to get enough of through diet alone. They've got the right amount of other vitamins and minerals for pregnancy as well.Omega-3 vitamins. The omega-3 fatty acid called DHA is important for your baby's brain, nerve, and eye development  and it's not in your regular prenatal vitamin. Experts recommend getting between 200 and 300 milligrams of DHA daily during pregnancy. You'd have to eat a good amount of cold water fish and other DHA-rich foods to get that amount through diet, so check with your doctor about taking a supplement.A calcium supplement. If you're not getting 1,000 milligrams a day  equivalent to three to four 8-ounce servings of yogurt or milk  you may want to check with your doctor about taking a calcium supplement in your second trimester, when calcium begins building up your baby's bones. Otherwise, you won't replace what your baby takes from you, increasing your risk for osteoporosis later in life. Look for a product labeled lead-free that contains calcium carbonate, the form your body most easily absorbs.AntacidMany women first experience the fiery discomfort of heartburn in the second half of pregnancy. There's no cure other than delivery, but some over-the-counter meds are safe, providing you get your caregiver's okay first.Constipation remedyCombine slower digestion with a growing uterus that crowds your digestive tract, and you may wind up with epic constipation. If more water, exercise, and fiber-rich foods don't do the trick, fiber supplements are safe to use when you're pregnant  every day, if needed  and may help prevent hemorrhoids. Stool softeners are generally considered okay to use, but check in with your doctor before you start taking any.Find out which fiber products and stool softeners are safe during pregnancy. Tips for constipation during pregnancyWhat causes constipation, and how can you prevent it?Gas remedyThe same culprit behind your constipation  higher progesterone levels  can be blamed for making you more bloated and gassy than you've ever been in your life. An over-the-counter medication with simethicone will help you feel fit to be in public again; just make sure to get your caregiver's okay first.Hemorrhoid reliefConstipation and pressure from your growing uterus make you more prone to hemorrhoids. Medicated wipes are safe for pregnancy, as are some creams and suppositories. Some women find witch hazel pads also spell hemorrhoid relief, and they may do double-duty in fighting pregnancy acne.Find out which hemorrhoid-relief products are safe during pregnancy.Yeast infection treatmentYeast infections can be another not-so-fun side effect of pregnancy, but luckily, there are many pregnancy-safe creams or suppositories to help you fight the dreaded itch. Just make sure to check in with your caregiver first, to find out whether a yeast infection's really what's causing your symptoms.Sleep aidThere's plenty to keep you up at night these days  discomfort, frequent bathroom trips, heartburn, and middle-of-the-night anxiety attacks about finances, for starters. No wonder more than three-quarters of pregnant women experience insomnia. When you need some rest, there are a few sleep aids that are generally considered safe for occasional use. As with any medication, though, check with your caregiver first.Pain reliever and fever reducerMany of these medications, like aspirin or ibuprofen, are off-limits during pregnancy, but acetaminophen is a safe way to treat pain, headache, and fever. Just make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the label.Find out which pain relievers and fever reducers are safe during pregnancy.Allergy remedyPregnancy can worsen allergies, or even make you allergic to substances that never bothered you before. Doctors prefer you to avoid medications during the first trimester as much as possible, but later on you can consult your caregiver about a safe allergy treatment. (Note: Many women get a stuffy nose during pregnancy without having a cold or allergies. If you don't have any symptoms besides congestion, you may have ""rhinitis of pregnancy."")Cold medicationGetting sick while pregnant is extra miserable. Some cold drugs are safe for pregnancy and some aren't. Because most cold medications contain several drugs to treat different symptoms, you'll need to read labels carefully. See the full list of what's okay and what to avoid.Nose care productsSaline spray or drops can help you clear out your schnoz and breathe a little easier whether you have a cold, allergies, or just a stuffy nose. And unlike a decongestant spray, you don't need to get your doctor's okay to use it.Petroleum jelly or a water-based nasal lubricant (available over the counter from pharmacies) can help avoid another common side effect of pregnancy: nosebleeds. They're more likely to occur if the membranes inside your nose get dry, so in parched environments  cold weather, airplanes, high altitudes, and the like  dab a little lubricant in your nose.EyedropsPregnancy hormones can make your eyes feel more dry and irritated. Some over-the-counter dry-eye drops are fine, while others contain ingredients that aren't proven safe for pregnancy, so ask your doctor for a recommendation.Heating padHeat isn't a proven therapy for pregnancy aches such as low back pain, but some women find it helps. Heating pads, hot water bottles, and microwavable heating packs are all safe options.Acne fighterHormonal changes give some lucky women a clear ""pregnancy glow"" but leave many others with more pimples than they've seen since puberty. Over-the-counter products containing alpha-hydroxy acids or glycolic acid are safe for pregnancy and may help control breakouts. If not, visit a dermatologist for stronger (but still baby-safe) options. Learn more about pregnancy-safe skin care.If you're suffering from acne, foundation or concealer can even out your skin tone. It's also a great remedy for other pregnancy skin woes such as dark splotches, rashes, or broken capillaries. Many stores offer free samples, so feel free to try before you buy.SunscreenIt's always recommended, but using sunscreen during pregnancy can prevent or minimize blotchy areas of skin darkening, known as the ""mask of pregnancy."" Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 30 or higher. Then wear it every day  clouds or shine.Hair removal productThe good news: Higher estrogen levels slow down the natural shedding of hairs, giving you a thicker head of hair. The bad news: You may notice more hair sprouting on your face or body, too. Waxing, tweezing, and shaving are all safe, but experts recommend staying away from bleaches and depilatories for now, since you may absorb the chemicals through your skin.A word of warning: Some women find waxing more painful while pregnant, so you may want to avoid more sensitive areas and try a test patch first.Hair accessoriesIf you've suddenly got more hair than you know what to do with, and not much time or energy to style it, hair clips, bands, combs, and pins can come in handy. Once you get the hang of it, a casually elegant updo (think French twist, messy bun) only takes a minute."
8 things nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-food-diary,"Between exhaustion, ""morning"" sickness, and ravenous hunger, pregnancy can make it a challenge to eat right. But growing babies rely on their mom for sustenance, so you'll want to make good choices about what goes into your mouth  and into your womb. Read on to discover the eight most important things nutritionists recommend for healthy eating and weight gain during pregnancy.1. Find out how much you should gain""Know your numbers,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""We should gain different amounts of weight based on our individual BMI. It's helpful to ask your doctor how much you should be gaining.""Guidelines call for women who begin pregnancy at a healthy weight to put on between 25 to 35 pounds. Women who are underweight or having twins or multiples are advised to gain more, while women who are overweight or obese should gain less. Get the details on how much weight you should gain during pregnancy and why.Those extra pounds are critical for your baby's growth and development. But with a typical baby weighing 7.5 pounds, what's all the rest of the weight for?Here's a breakdown: An expectant mom's breasts add up to 2 additional pounds as they swell in preparation to feed the baby. The placenta and growing uterus add another 4 pounds. Factor in the extra blood flowing through your body  up to 3.5 pounds, which explains why a pregnant woman's iron needs are so high  and 6 to 8 pounds of amniotic fluid and other fluids, and you're starting to feel heavy. Plus, your body will need up to 9 more pounds of fat to use as energy reserves during pregnancy and lactation.2. Exercise regularlyDon't assume that pregnancy is a good time to suspend your gym membership. It's important to remain physically active for your own health and that of your baby. Hitting the treadmill or attending pregnancy yoga keeps your body strong, can help prevent gestational diabetes, and can help you avoid gaining too much weight, which can lead to a too-big baby. Regular exercise also prepares you for the ultimate workout: labor and delivery.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women (who have received their provider's approval to work out) exercise moderately for at least 20 to 30 minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. Unfortunately, many moms-to-be aren't exercising this much.""A lot of my patients tell me they're not active at all,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women.Kaidanian recommends fitting in exercise whenever and however you can. ""Even if it's just 10 minutes of walking around your apartment after each meal, that's 30 minutes you weren't doing before.""3. Drink waterThe Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women drink 10 8-ounce glasses of water or other beverages each day. (If it's warm out or you're exercising, drink even more.)When Kaidanian asks her pregnant patients what they drink when they're thirsty, more often than not, they list soda, juice, or coffee. However, it's best to keep caffeine and sugar to a minimum during your pregnancy. (Even 100 percent fruit juice contains a lot of natural sugars.)""Water is the best source of hydration,"" says Kaidanian. If you're not tracking your fluid ounces, just tote a water bottle with you wherever you go and sip throughout the day until your urine is clear or pale yellow in color  a sign of proper hydration.If plain water isn't appealing  or is even nauseating  try sparkling water with various flavors (like lemon, orange, and berry) or water with a squeeze of lemon. Or make spa water: Keep a pitcher of tap water in the fridge and add cut oranges, apples, or other fruit to infuse it with subtle flavor.4. Be diligent about prenatal vitaminsI forgot. It's too big. I don't like it.Kaidanian hears a lot of reasons for skipping a daily prenatal vitamin and accepts none of them. Just take yours, she says, because prenatal vitamins are a nearly effortless way to ensure you and your baby are getting the nutrients you need. Many women's diets are deficient in vitamin D and iron as well as folic acid, which is critical in the prevention of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.""It's hard to meet your nutrient intake every day for every single nutrient unless you're planning out specifically what you need for your body, and most people are not doing that,"" says Kaidanian. ""They make so many kinds of prenatal vitamins now  chewables, gummies, and even mini vitamins for those who find them hard to swallow  there's really no excuse.""5. Avoid gaining too muchGaining too much weight during pregnancy increases your risk for gestational diabetes and birth complications such as c-section delivery and tearing.Excess weight gain can lead to a larger baby, which can make for a harder delivery, says Daniel Roshan, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New York City and an assistant professor at New York University.""We try to keep our c-section rate down, so we really emphasize diet,"" says Roshan. If an expecting mom is eating unhealthily, he says, ""it's like the baby is sitting around having chocolate all day. He gets chubby. When it comes time for delivery, it's harder for him to come out, so there's a bigger chance of complications.""6. Eat small mealsWhen you're nauseated, the thought of a large meal can really turn your stomach. And later in pregnancy, as your baby crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, eating even a fairly modest amount of food at one time can be uncomfortable.Feel free to focus on eating frequent mini-meals. ""Eating small meals often helps because it constantly keeps a little bit of something in your stomach and keeps your blood sugar even,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the New York University Maternal Fetal Care Center.7. Snack smartStock your kitchen with healthy staples so you can easily grab good-for-you snacks. Wash fresh fruit ahead of time and keep portioned bags of trail mix in your desk at work. String cheese and whole grain crackers are satisfying too. Try whipping up a batch of smoothie over the weekend, then freezing it in individual jars.At night, stick a jar in the fridge to defrost. Come morning, add some wheat germ or flax seed and call it breakfast.""Every bite when you're pregnant is impacting your baby, so if you can include nutrition, you'll feel better about snacking,"" says dietitian Jessica Corwin.8. Learn to substituteIt's fine to give into your food cravings in moderation, but it's smart to give them healthier tweaks  especially if they're becoming frequent items on your menu.For example, if you regularly yearn for pizza, follow Ellie Krieger's lead and make pizza on a whole-grain English muffin with part-skim cheese, tomato sauce, and spinach. ""I craved pizza constantly,"" says Krieger, who hosted Food Network's Healthy Appetite and is the author of Weeknight Wonders. ""That hit the spot without going all out and having a big, greasy slice each day.""Craving chocolate? Krieger suggests stirring a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a bit of sugar into a glass of warm, low-fat milk. ""You get the antioxidant bonus from the cocoa and calcium from the milk, it's the perfect snack size  about 200 calories, and it's filling.""Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Quick and healthy breakfasts for kids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-breakfasts-for-kids_1186670.bc,"Finding time to make your child breakfast  not to mention getting him to eat it  can be a struggle. The good news is that you don't have to prepare a complete meal every morning. To get your child going, you just need to make sure he gets food that will provide a dose of energy and at least a few essential nutrients. Here are some ways to give him what he needs.No time to linger: Breakfast in secondsGranola bars. Loaded with fiber from whole grains, granola bars are a great source of energy in the form of carbohydrates. Studies show that children are mentally sharper when they've eaten something, and brain cells need a constant supply of carbohydrates. Just watch out for granola bars that are more like candy bars  choose varieties that are lower in sugar.Whole wheat bagel with peanut butter. Whole grain bagels, such as whole wheat and rye, have more fiber than plain or seeded varieties. Peanut butter is great source of protein, and most of the good fats in the ""natural"" varieties helps keep arteries healthy.Oat bran muffin. With more fiber and less fat than a typical blueberry muffin, oat bran muffins also provide surprising amounts of potassium and magnesium.Fruit. Apples are not only refreshing but also high in fiber. Bananas top other fresh fruits as a source of potassium, a mineral that kids lose during physical activity. Fruit staves off a midmorning slump by regulating your child's blood sugar level.Eat and run: Nutritious two-minute mealsOrange-banana smoothie. Orange juice, low-fat yogurt, and half a banana are all you need to whip up a taste treat that's high in carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, and calcium. Though remember to limit juice: Experts recommend that children drink no more than 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of fruit juice a day, and half a banana plus 1/2 cup of fruit juice already meets the recommended daily intake of fruit for your preschooler, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Very berry smoothie. Blend 1/2 cup of low-fat milk with half a banana and a handful of frozen berries, which are exceptionally rich in antioxidants (substances that combat cancerous changes in cells). Add a few more berries to adjust consistency.Fruit salad. Prepare a big fruit salad on Sunday that you serve for the next couple of days. Add a dollop of yogurt to each serving for extra protein and calcium.Toaster treats. Frozen waffles take almost no time to prepare. Choose whole grain varieties for a dose of fiber, and top them with berries or sliced bananas instead of syrup. Blueberry breakfast smoothieStart your day with this delicious smoothie, packed with fruit, oats, and almonds.Ten minutes to spare: Pour on the flakesExperts say one of the healthiest breakfast options is cereal with low-fat milk. The combo is high in calcium, low in fat, and loaded with fiber (if you choose a whole grain variety). Plus, all cereals are fortified with important nutrients like folic acid, one of the B vitamins.Let your child pick the kind he likes, but steer him away from the ones that are coated with sugar. Encourage him to sweeten his cereal with sliced banana or another fruit instead. Serve with a small glass of orange juice, and the vitamin C will help his body absorb the iron in the cereal. Here are three high-fiber, low-sugar cereal superstars:Wheat or oat flakes. The breakfast of athletic heroes, cereal made from whole wheat (or oat) flake fills up your child and keeps him going. Look for varieties with at least 5 grams of fiber and no more than a few grams of sugar per serving.Grape-Nuts. With no added sugar and the goodness of whole grains, Grape-Nuts is one of the best choices on the shelf.O-shaped toasted oat cereal. These little O's have always been a hit with children. But nutritionists love them because they're made from whole grains and have as little as 1 gram of sugar per serving. (Multigrain and other varieties may have more sugar  check the label.)Instant oatmeal. A minute in the microwave is all it takes to produce a steaming bowl of nutritious high-fiber oatmeal. Overnight oatsA nutritious on-the-go breakfast during pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Where we stand: Fruit juice.

Doctor visit: The 4-month checkup,https://www.babycenter.com/0_doctor-visit-the-4-month-checkup_6587.bc,"Find out what to expect at this well-baby checkup. Download a printable version of our 4-month checkup worksheet to take with you. You may want to read through the questions and jot down answers beforehand.What the doctor will doWeigh and measure your babyYou'll need to undress your baby completely for weighing. The doctor weighs your baby, measures length and head circumference, and plots the numbers on a growth chart.The chart enables you to see how your baby compares with other children the same age. But it doesn't matter whether he's in the 5th or the 95th percentile, as long as his rate of growth is steady from one visit to the next.Do a complete physicalHeart and lungs: Uses a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems.Eyes: Checks for signs of congenital eye conditions and other problems. May also check for blocked tear ducts and discharge.Ears: Looks for signs of infection and observes how your baby responds to sound.Mouth: Looks for signs of thrush (an oral yeast infection) and any signs of emerging teeth.Head: Checks the soft spots (fontanels) and the shape of your baby's head. Also checks to see if your baby's head is developing a flat spot.Body: Checks your baby's reflexes and muscle tone, and examines his skin for rashes. Puts the baby on his tummy to check his head control.Belly: Presses gently on the abdomen to check for a hernia or any enlarged organs.Genitals: Opens your baby's diaper and checks for signs of infection.Hips and legs: Moves your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Give your baby her shotsYour baby will receive the DTaP, Hib, polio, pneumococcal vaccines (combined in two shots) and the rotavirus vaccine (given orally).An assistant may administer the vaccines. This is usually done at the end of the appointment so you can have some privacy afterward to comfort your baby.Address any other concernsYour doctor will recommend giving vitamin D drops to breastfed babies. (Babies who drink 17 to 32 ounces of formula a day are getting enough vitamin D.)The doctor will address any health concerns (such as how to deal with constipation, colds, and the flu), ask you some questions (see below), and help you understand what's normal at this age.Questions the doctor may ask:How's your baby sleeping? Your baby's sleep may be falling into a more predictable routine with three to four daytime naps and a longer nighttime sleep interval of six hours or more.When, how, and how often is your baby eating? Some babies aren't ready for solids quite yet  4 to 6 months is the recommended time  but it can't hurt to talk to the doctor about it now. Ask the doctor how and when you should begin, and whether your baby needs any extra vitamins.What are your baby's bowel movements like? Soft feces are best, but color can vary. If your baby has ever passed frequent, smelly, watery, mucus-streaked stools, it's probably diarrhea. Ask the doctor about the best way to treat it.Can your baby roll over one way or sit with support? Both of these are skills that your baby will begin to develop around now, though she probably won't be able to roll over in both directions or sit without support until around 6 months of age.Can your baby do a mini-pushup? This skill is typical for 4-month-olds and shows that their physical development is on track. If your baby is still having difficulty controlling or lifting her head, let the doctor know.What sounds does your baby make? Your baby's language skills may include babbling, squealing, and even laughing. She's probably smiling at you even more now, too, sometimes even before you smile at her, and her mouth is getting quite active  exploring objects, drooling, and blowing bubbles. If your baby is making fewer sounds than she did before, tell the doctor.How are your baby's motor skills? Your baby may now reach for and grab things. She may also be able to bring her hands together in front of her. If she uses one hand more than the other, mention it to the doctor. She should also be kicking with both legs and bouncing on them when held upright above your lap or the floor. If she holds her legs straight a lot of the time, tell the doctor.Have you noticed anything unusual about your baby's eyes or the way she looks at things? At every well-baby visit, the doctor should check the structure and alignment of the eyes and your baby's ability to move them correctly.How's your baby's hearing? If your baby doesn't turn toward sounds, be sure to tell the doctor. The sooner potential hearing problems are investigated, the sooner they can be treated.What's next?Find out what's in store for you the 6-month doctor visit.View and print a clean copy of the 4-month doctor visit worksheet.Show sources Hide sources Mayo Clinic.

Medication for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_medication-for-iron-deficiency-anemia-during-pregnancy_10414723.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat medication is used to treat iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy?If you have iron-deficiency anemia, it means your body has a low level of iron, which is necessary to build healthy red blood cells. The most effective treatment for anemia during pregnancy is to take an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin.It may take a little trial and error to determine the correct dose. Work with your healthcare provider to balance effectiveness with any unpleasant side effects. You may have to take your prenatal vitamin and iron supplement at different times.Are iron supplements safe to take in pregnancy?Yes, iron supplements are safe to take during pregnancy. And if you take the supplements as prescribed, you should see an improvement in your iron-deficiency anemia.Take your regular prenatal vitamin  you still need this for other vital minerals. And make iron part of your pregnancy diet, too.Note: Iron supplements for adults can be dangerous for children. Children can get very sick, or even die, from accidentally taking iron pills. Keep your iron pills safely out of the reach of children.What are the side effects of iron supplements?The first thing you may notice when you start taking iron is that your stools turn a dark color, almost black, because your body doesn't completely absorb the mineral. Although it looks different, there's no need to worry. This is just a normal reaction to the extra iron in your body.Gastrointestinal side effects are most common. You may feel bloated or nauseated, or have an upset stomach.Being constipated and unable to have a bowel movement is another common side effect of pregnancy, and iron supplements can make constipation worse. If you're suffering from constipation, drink plenty of fluids, eat at least 25 grams of fiber a day, and use the bathroom whenever you feel the urge to have a bowel movement.Work with your provider to come up with an exercise plan, and try drinking prune juice to get things moving. Your provider might also prescribe a stool softener.How do I deal with the side effects of iron, and take it so it's most effective?How and when you take iron makes a big difference. For example, if you feel nauseated after taking your supplement, try taking it with a small snack or some juice. Don't take iron with a meal  too much food prevents iron absorption.Iron is best absorbed with acid. Take supplements with orange juice, so your body can get the maximum benefits.Medication can also affect how your body absorbs iron. For example, heartburn is another common ailment during pregnancy, and antacids can affect the absorption of iron. If you need to take antacids, it's best to take your iron supplement at least two hours before or two hours after the antacid.Iron can also prevent the absorption of certain drugs, like levothyroxine, which is taken for thyroid problems. If you take iron and levothyroxine, take the pills four hours apart. Check whether you need to adjust the timing of your other medications.Some foods and drinks can even prevent your body from absorbing iron properly. These include:Coffee and teaEggsDairy productsBran, soy, nuts and seeds, and other foods high in phytates (the storage form of phosphorus)For the best results, try to take supplements one hour before or two hours after consuming these foods and drinks. The same may apply to calcium supplements.This seems like a lot to remember, but it becomes second nature once you get into a routine. And don't give up if you're experiencing unpleasant side effects from iron supplements. Your provider may recommend a different type of supplement or suggest splitting the dose into smaller quantities to take at intervals throughout the day.Are there any alternatives to iron supplements?Talk to your provider about your options. If you can't tolerate taking an iron pill, ask for a liquid supplement. (You may want to use a straw to take liquid iron supplements so you don't stain your teeth.)If you have severe iron-deficiency anemia that doesn't respond well to iron supplements, you may need to get iron intravenously. Your provider can do this or she can refer you to a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

High-risk women say: Coping with iron-deficiency anemia,https://www.babycenter.com/0_high-risk-women-say-coping-with-iron-deficiency-anemia_10414728.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHere are some tips, advice, and wise words from other BabyCenter moms who have had to cope with the fatigue, extra pills, and tests that are all part of having iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy.Feeling fatigued""I was diagnosed with anemia around 17 weeks when I had first trimester bloodwork and screenings. The main symptom was extreme fatigue, even after the tiredness had worn off from the first trimester."" Canadianmama30""My iron level was very low, and my main symptom was extreme fatigue. I'm taking iron now, but whenever I forget to take it, I become tired right away."" Momatobeto2""I was diagnosed with anemia in the first trimester. I'd come home from work and need a nap for two to three hours. I started taking ferrous sulfate pills, as the nurse suggested. After taking the pills, I had much more energy."" Kimw1219""I got really tired and just thought it was from my growing baby, but then I found out after a blood test that I was slightly anemic. I'm now taking an iron supplement and feel a million times better. The difference in energy is phenomenal!"" Babydollw2112""I'm taking an iron supplement at night and, aside from constipation, I feel better. I don't feel like I'm dragging as much during the day, and I don't feel so weak."" Jojoelovesyou""I noticed that I was super tired and a little more short of breath, so my doctor tested me and sure enough my hemoglobin level was slightly low. I'm now on one iron pill a day with my prenatal vitamin. I started to take it two weeks ago and have already seen an increase in energy."" Heatherbp26Iron supplements""It's best to take iron on an empty stomach, but eating a small snack can help with the cramps and nausea. Get stool softeners. You'll probably need to take them twice a day. Also, if you're taking a big dose of iron once a day, it can be harder on you than two to three smaller doses. Ask your doctor if you can take smaller doses instead."" FiveFamily""I take my iron pill in the morning with orange juice to help absorb it. Then I take my prenatal at night."" MrsCCincy""I have trouble remembering [to take my iron supplement]. So I take my prenatal with a meal, and then set my phone alarm before bed to take the iron pill."" 3Petites""I have mild anemia and have been taking a supplement since week 10. I was told to take it at a different time than my prenatal. So I take one in the morning and one in the evening because the calcium in the prenatal can interfere with iron absorption."" Lucky_CharmsEating well""Eat lots of leafy greens and red meat. I also put blackstrap molasses in everything (including tea and oatmeal), and I make a shake with it every day. After I started doing all that, I was able to stay awake more."" MintonMama""Try cooking in a cast iron skillet. If you make your own soups, for instance, you could saute them first in a cast iron skillet before putting them in the blender. They also make little cast-iron fish that you can put in your boiling water."" SuzannieBananie""For foods, you can't beat dark or red meat. Also try dark greens, beans, dried fruit, and iron-enriched cereal. But don't have cereal with milk because the calcium inhibits the iron absorption. Vitamin C helps, so try drinking orange juice with it instead."" A BabyCenter memberBowel issues""When you start taking iron, increase your fiber intake too because iron can cause constipation. If you do have problems, drink some prune juice!"" Babydollw2112""Iron supplements and prenatal vitamins with iron in them can cause dark brown or black stools. It looks bad, but it's a sign that they're working the way they're supposed to."" MeganmTransfusions""I was supposed to have a blood transfusion after I had my baby because my iron was too low. I refused because I didn't like the thought of it. I regretted it after leaving the hospital because I was constantly passing out. I had to have a lot more help doing things around the house and looking after my baby."" Breecc""I get iron infusions for severe anemia. The iron takes a while for my body to absorb  up to three months after each infusion. When my first infusion didn't take right away, I had a blood transfusion.

Quick and healthy snacks for school-age kids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-snacks-for-school-age-kids_66905.bc,"In just minutes, you can prepare nutritious snacks your child will love. Offering a broad variety of food helps her get the vitamins and minerals she needs. Remember to use non-fat or low-fat dairy products and choose whole -grain breads and cereals.Here are a few quick, easy, and healthy snack suggestions:Fresh fruit.Nothing's better than fresh fruit: It's colorful, sweet and juicy, packed with vitamins and minerals, and full of fiber. Serve sliced apple, orange sections, a banana, or a bowl of berries. Kids love finger food, making this an easy and fun way to enjoy a nutritious snack.Dried and pured fruit. Offer a handful of dried apricots, peaches, pairs, and pitted prunes, or serve a small bowl of applesauce (the kind without added sugar).Dips. Give your child the option of mixing and dipping his favorite foods. You might be surprised at the combinations your child is willing to try  let him explore and have fun.Give him a few wedges of pita bread paired with a small bowl of hummus or spinach dip. Strawberries and apple slices go well with creamy yogurt, and pretzels taste great with a variety of sweet and savory mustards.Cottage cheese. Serve in a small bowl topped with chopped fresh fruit, or mix in peas and carrots to make confetti cottage cheese.Eggs. Scrambled eggs take just a few minutes. Try adding turkey and cheese, or mix in salsa and wrap it up in a tortilla for a burrito. Make hard-cooked eggs on the weekend and store them in the fridge for weekday snacks.Mini pizza. Toast half an English muffin and spread about a tablespoon of marinara sauce on it. Add some chopped vegetables and a tablespoon of shredded cheese and broil in the oven for a minute or twountil the cheese melts.Parfait party. Layer a small bowl or dessert glass with one-third cup of vanilla yogurt, one-quarter cup of chopped fruit, and a few berries or banana slices. Sprinkle a little granola on the top.Mini quesadilla. Sprinkle one small corn tortilla with a couple of tablespoons of shredded cheese and microwave for 20 seconds. Fold in half and cut into wedges. Serve with a small bowl of mild salsa for dipping.Waffles. Toast a frozen waffle and top with a spoonful of yogurt and some fresh fruit.Vegetables. Get your child in the habit of snacking on vegetables. Fresh veggies like carrot sticks, green beans, and broccoli pair well with dip. Bake veggie ""chips"" with carrots, beets, or sweet potatoes. Roasted kale is a delicious way to serve greens.Edamame. These vitamin-packed beans are a great source of vegetarian protein. Look for bags of edamame shelled or in their pods in the freezer case. They only need to be boiled a few minutes if they aren't already precooked.Light popcorn. Some brands of popcorn are swimming in butter or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (which can clog arteries). But there are healthier brands surprisingly low in fat and, like all popcorn, high in fiber.For convenience, buy bags of pre-popped popcorn but check the nutritional content. If you're microwaving or making air-popped popcorn, sprinkle hot popcorn with Parmesan cheese for added flavor.Nuts. It's a bum rap: Nuts are high in fat, but it's the kind that's as good for the heart and arteries as olive oil. (The exception is macadamia nuts, which are high in saturated fat.) Nuts are also loaded with protein and essential vitamins and minerals  and they're wonderfully filling.You might want to toss together a custom mix of GORP (good old raisins and peanuts) for a portable, high-energy snack.Granola bars. A crunchy granola bar has whole grains, fiber, and protein. But watch out for granola bars that are more like candy bars  be sure to buy ones low in sugar. Try serving with yogurt for dipping.Sunflower seeds. High in fiber and protein, sunflower seeds are a powerhouse for growing kids. Sure, they're relatively high in fat, but most of it is monounsaturated, the healthful kind found in olive oil and nuts.Frozen fruit bars. The best of these frozen treats contain chunks of real fruit. You can buy them in the store or make them yourself with 100 percent juice and chopped, fresh fruit, or by freezing a smoothie. Try orange, pineapple, peach, and banana, to name a few. They're a great, fat-free refresher (and especially fun for your child to make).Frozen grapes. If your child resists eating fruit, try keeping a bowl of rinsed grapes in the freezer. They're rich in antioxidants, and freezing grapes seems to transform them into bonbons in the eyes of kids. (If you're worried about choking, cut grapes into smaller pieces.)Raisins. Loaded with antioxidants and high in carbohydrates (an immediate source of energy), raisins are also high in fiber and iron. Plus, kids love those little single-serving boxes.Fruit juice. Make sure it's100 percent fruit juice and limit your child to no more than three-quarters of a cup daily. For a healthy, balanced snack, try a small glass of juice and a few crackers with a tablespoon or two of cream cheese or all-natural peanut butter (which has no sugar added).Fruit shakes. Throw a banana, half a cup of milk, and a handful of berries in your blender, and you've got a nutritious shake. Add yogurt for more flavor, protein, and calcium. For the best consistency, use frozen fruit.Orange freeze. Blend a peeled orange with a cup or two of ice in an electric blender. Adjust flavor with a little sweetener.Peanut butter powerball. Mix peanut butter with cornflakes and shape into balls. Roll in crushed graham crackers.Pita pockets. Cut pita bread in half. Spoon ricotta cheese into a pita pocket and add apple slices. Sprinkle with cinnamon.Mighty muffins. Mix a couple tablespoons of cream cheese with some sunflower seeds and chopped, dried fruit. Spread on half a toasted English muffin.Get more tips for healthy snacks and meals."

Healthy foods on the go (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_healthy-foods-on-the-go-ages-5-to-8_1436238.bc,"Kids take in their daily nutrition from snacks as well as meals. That's why it's a good idea to take along healthy snacks when you're on the go.Variety is the key to good nutrition, so offer your child a range of healthy options. Let your child choose and he'll be more likely to eat what you give him.Consider these nutritious foods to grab and go:Fresh fruit. Fruit is easy to pack and carry, and it also has lots of vitamins and fiber to boost your child's energy and stave off hunger.Bananas and apricots are high in potassium and help regulate blood pressure. Oranges and kiwis are high in vitamin C and help with growth.Papaya, strawberries, and cantaloupe are good sources of folate, which helps produce red blood cells. Apples are sweet, filling, and high in fiber, which reduces cholesterol and prevents constipation.Trail mix. Varied textures and flavors make this snack fun to eat. Be sure to choose items that are easy to eat with your fingers.Tailor the blend to your child's tastes.Combine whole grain cereals and pretzels for fiber, chopped or slivered nuts for protein, and chopped dried fruits for vitamins and energy. If your child likes chocolate, add a little dark chocolate, which has antioxidants.Flavored popcorn. Popcorn is a satisfying whole grain snack that's packed with fiber and polyphenols. Polyphenols are good for the heart and may help prevent cancer and other diseases, including diabetes.For a light version, air pop your popcorn or make your own on the stove top. Either way is as easy as microwaving and puts you in charge of flavor and nutrition. Store popcorn in a resealable bag.Quick stove top recipe: Pour 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large, deep saucepan (a stock pot works well) over medium heat. Add 3 corn kernels and cover. When the kernels pop, add 1/2 cup of kernels and cover the pot. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the popping stops  it should take less than 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, uncover it, then drizzle popped corn with a little butter or olive oil and whatever seasonings you like. Some good flavors to try: grated Parmesan cheese, smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, a little garlic salt, cinnamon, five-spice powder, chili powder, dried herbs, or salt. (A light spritz of water first helps seasonings stick.) Peanut butter fruit spirals. Combine chopped dates, raisins, or bananas with reduced fat peanut butter (about 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup fruit).First, spread the peanut butter mixture over two 8-inch tortillas or whole wheat wraps and arrange the fruit on top. Sprinkle each tortilla or wrap with a heaping tablespoon of honey-crunch wheat germ and a pinch of ground cinnamon. Roll up the tortillas or wraps and slice each roll into about 6 pieces.Makes 3 servings (about 4 pieces each).Muffins. Add a few tablespoons of wheat germ or a handful of oats to any batter to increase the fiber content. Add chopped nuts for protein and other nutrients. Package carrot or fruit muffins in individual plastic bags.Granola bars. Check the label carefully and avoid unwanted sugar and fat. They're also easy to make on your own, just search online for ""healthy granola bar recipes."" Make a batch on the weekend and you'll have a supply that will last you all week.Rice cakes. Try spreading two mini apple-cinnamon rice cakes with a little peanut butter and putting a banana slice or raisins between them for a mini-sandwich.String cheese or cubed cheese. If you have a cooler or won't be away long, cheese provides calcium and protein. Add some whole grain crackers and thinly sliced apple for a satisfying mini-meal.Raisins. Sweetness, fiber, iron, and quick energy in each handful. What more could you want? Single-serving boxes are easy to pack.(If you're going to be out for a while, and you'll be near a restroom where your child can brush afterward, take along a travel toothbrush and toothpaste to get that sticky raisin residue off your child's teeth.)Raw veggies such as baby carrots or edamame. Serve them solo or with a yogurt dip or hummus. Package in a plastic container with separate compartments for the veggies and dip. Store in a cooler or an insulated bag with an ice pack.Cups of applesauce or fruit. Applesauce comes in different flavors and blends for a satisfying low-fat source of fiber that tastes pleasantly sweet.Prepackaged cups of fruit  like berries, peaches, grapefruit, and pineapple  are packed with vitamin C. Look for brands with no sugar added.Something to drink. A reusable bottle of tap water is your best choice. You can also buy milk in small, individual cartons that don't need refrigeration. If you want to give your child juice, choose a brand without added sugar and limit it to no more than three-quarters of a cup daily.For more healthy big-kids snacks, see BabyCenter's list of quick and healthy snacks for kids.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Wheat flours and breads are also enriched with this vitamin.Note: Exposure to light can destroy riboflavin, so keep foods tightly sealed in opaque containers or in a cupboard.Try these foods:1 cup nonfat milk: 0.45 mg1 ounce almonds: 0.29 mg1 large egg, hard boiled: 0.26 mg1 cup fortified puffed wheat cereal: 0.22 mg1/2 cup spinach, cooked: 0.21 mg3 ounces dark chicken meat, roasted: 0.16 mg3 ounces ground beef, cooked: 0.15 mgsix spears asparagus, boiled: 0.13 mg3 ounces salmon, cooked: 0.13 mg1 ounce cheddar cheese: 0.11 mg1/2 cup broccoli, chopped and boiled: 0.10 mgone slice enriched white bread: 0.09 mg3 ounces roasted light chicken meat: 0.08 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 0.06 mg(Note that 3 ounces of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a supplement?You'll probably get enough riboflavin from a diet that includes a variety of grains, dairy products, eggs, meats, green vegetables, and enriched cereals and grains, and most prenatal supplements provide the dietary reference intake (DRI) for riboflavin.However, some women are at higher risk for a riboflavin deficiency, including women who are vegetarians, lactose intolerant, or have anorexia. Anemia, dermatitis, and sore and cracked lips and mouth are among the signs of a riboflavin deficiency.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2015. What are B vitamins and folate?

Nutrition guidelines for young children (ages 2 to 4),https://www.babycenter.com/0_nutrition-guidelines-for-young-children-ages-2-to-4_64359.bc,"Most preschoolers develop curiosity about food and new eating habits as they grow. While certain foods are essential, every child has unique dietary needs and preferences. To make sure your child gets enough of all the right stuff, see these tips for healthy snacks and meals, and follow the guidelines below.Nutrition for preschoolersOffer your child foods from all five major food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and protein) at every meal. You may not always be able to get him to eat the recommended amount from each group every day, but if you serve a variety of healthy food, he'll eventually get what he needs over the course of a week.GrainsGrains contain fiber, which aids digestion, and complex carbohydrates, which provide energy. Grains are also great sources of B vitamins, and some fortified ready-to-eat cereals provide an entire day's worth of many vitamins and minerals.Grains come in two types  whole grains and refined grains. Whole grain products use the entire grain kernel and have more fiber, iron, and B vitamins than refined grains. Examples of whole grains are whole wheat flour and bread, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta.Refined grains have been processed to give them a finer texture and a longer shelf life. Refined grain products include white flour and bread, white rice, and most kinds of pasta.Some foods are made from both whole grains and refined grains.The USDA recommends getting at least half of your grains from whole grains.How much preschoolers need daily:Children 2 to 3 years old: 3 ounces.Children 4 years old: 5 ounces.How much is in an ounce of grains: An ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked pasta or cooked cereal.Examples of the daily requirement:Children 2 to 3 years old:One slice whole wheat toast for breakfast, mini pita sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup whole wheat pasta for dinner.1 cup toasted oat cereal for breakfast, open-faced sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup whole wheat rice for dinner.1/2 cup oatmeal for breakfast, 6-inch whole wheat tortilla wrap for lunch, 1 small whole wheat roll for dinner.Children 4 years old:1 cup oatmeal for breakfast, whole wheat bread sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup brown rice for dinner.One whole grain mini bagel for breakfast, five whole wheat crackers for snack, open-faced sandwich for lunch, English muffin pizza for dinner.One whole wheat pancake for breakfast, two rye crispbreads for snack, grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked bulgur for dinner.VegetablesVegetables provide plenty of fiber, along with vitamins C and A and potassium. In addition, most produce contains antioxidants, disease-fighting substances that may lower the risk of cancer and heart disease later in life.Over the course of a week, try to serve your child lots of different-colored vegetables  dark green broccoli, light green beans, orange carrots, red tomatoes, and so on. That way, you'll be sure he's getting all the nutrients each vegetable has to offer.How much preschoolers need daily:Children 2 to 3 years old: 1 cup.Children 4 years old: 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of vegetables: A cup of vegetables equals 1 cup of cooked or raw vegetables, 2 cups of raw leafy greens, one large tomato, or two medium carrots.Examples of the daily requirement:Children 2 to 3 years old:1/2 cup oven-baked sweet potato fries for lunch or snack, and 1/4 cup each cooked broccoli trees and red pepper strips for dinner.1/2 cup mashed baked potato with 1/4 cup chopped tomato for lunch, and 1/4 cup cooked peas for dinner.1/4 cup cooked mushrooms (in a scrambled egg) for breakfast, 1/4 cup cooked green beans for lunch, 1/4 cup sliced cherry tomatoes for snack, and 1/4 cup tomato sauce for dinner.Children 4 years old:1/2 cup chopped salad greens with 1/4 cup sliced cherry tomatoes for lunch, 1/4 cup cooked cauliflower and 1/4 cup of cooked broccoli trees for a snack, and 1/2 cup cooked corn for dinner.1/2 cup low-sodium tomato juice for breakfast, one half baked sweet potato for lunch, and 1/2 cup cooked broccoli trees for dinner.1/2 cup cooked squash for lunch, one half small ear of corn on the cob for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked baby spinach for dinner. FruitFruit also provides plenty of fiber, along with vitamins C and A and potassium. In addition, most produce contains antioxidants, disease-fighting substances that may lower the risk of cancer and heart disease later in life.Serve your child a colorful variety of fruits to be sure he gets as many different nutrients as possible.How much preschoolers need daily:Children 2 to 3 years old: 1 cup.Children 4 years old: 1 to 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of fruit: A cup of fruit equals 1 cup of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit; 1/2 cup dried fruit; one half of a large apple; one 8- or 9-inch banana; and one medium (4-inch diameter) grapefruit.Examples of the daily requirement:Children 2 to 3 years old:1/4 cup sliced strawberries for breakfast, 1/4 cup grapes (cut in quarters) for snack, 1/2 cup applesauce for dessert.1/4 cup blueberries for breakfast, 1/2 cup canned pears in juice (cut up) for lunch or snack, 1/4 cup chopped frozen raspberries for dessert.1/2 cup sliced banana for breakfast or snack, 1/2 cup (or one 4-ounce snack container) fruit cocktail with no sugar added for dessert. (Check to make sure pieces are small enough for young children. Chop smaller if necessary.)Children 4 years old:1/2 cup sliced banana for breakfast, 1/2 cup raisins for snack, 1/2 cup sliced strawberries for dessert.Half an apple (sliced) for snack, half an orange (sectioned) for lunch, 1/2 cup canned peaches for dessert.Half a grapefruit for breakfast, 1/2 cup applesauce for lunch, 1/2 cup sliced berries for dessert.DairyMost dairy products are wonderful sources of calcium, which gives your child strong teeth and bones. They're also excellent sources of protein  good to know if your child doesn't like meat.Children 2 years old and up should switch to low-fat or fat-free milk. They'll get the same amount of calcium and vitamin D, but less solid fat and fewer calories. Solid fats are mainly saturated fat, which can raise blood cholesterol levels. You'll be doing your child a favor if you get him in the habit of drinking low-fat milk as a youngster.How much preschoolers need daily:Children 2 to 3 years old: 2 cups.Children 4 years old: 2 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of dairy: A cup of dairy can be 1 cup milk, yogurt, or soy milk; 1 1/2 ounces, two slices, or 1/3 cup shredded hard cheese (such as cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, or Parmesan); 2 ounces processed (American) cheese; 1/2 cup ricotta cheese; 2 cups cottage cheese; 1 cup pudding made with milk; or 1 1/2 cups ice cream.Examples of the daily requirement:Children 2 to 3 years old:1/2 cup milk for breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for snack, one slice cheddar cheese for lunch, 1/2 cup milk for dinner.1/2 cup milk for breakfast, one slice Swiss cheese for snack, 1/2 cup milk for dinner, 1/2 cup frozen yogurt for dessert.1/2 cup yogurt for breakfast, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella for dinner.Children 4 years old:1/2 cup milk for breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for snack, 1/2 cup milk, and one slice cheddar cheese for lunch, 1/2 cup pudding for dessert.1/2 cup milk for breakfast, one slice cheese for snack, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/2 cup milk, 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese for dinner.1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese (in eggs or on toast) for breakfast, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/2 cup milk for dinner, 1/2 cup frozen yogurt for dessert. ProteinMeat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, soy products, and nuts and seeds are all protein foods. (Beans and peas are also part of the vegetable food group.) Unless you're raising your child to be vegetarian, try to serve seafood at least twice a week.Choose lean or low-fat meat and poultry, and remove skin from chicken before cooking. Protein foods give your child iron, zinc, and some B vitamins.How much preschoolers need daily:Children 2 to 3 years old: Two ounce equivalents.Children 4 years old: Four ounce equivalents.How much is in an ounce of protein: An ounce equivalent of protein equals 1 ounce of meat, fish, or poultry; one egg; 1 tablespoon of nut butter; 1/4 cup of cooked beans; 1/8 cup of tofu; and 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds.Examples of the daily requirement:Children 2 to 3 years old:One egg for breakfast, 1/4 cup mashed kidney beans for dinner.1 ounce turkey sausage for breakfast, 1 ounce salmon filet for dinner.1 ounce sliced chicken for lunch, 1 ounce tuna for dinner.Children 4 years old:One egg for breakfast, 1 ounce sliced turkey for lunch, 1 ounce cooked ground beef and 1/4 cup chili beans for dinner.1/4 cup tofu scramble for breakfast, 1 tablespoon peanut butter for lunch (spread thinly on bread or crackers to avoid choking hazard), 1/4 cup refried beans for dinner.1 tablespoon nut butter for breakfast, one egg for lunch, 1 ounce roast beef and 1/4 cup cooked lentils for dinner.Oils and fats: Use sparinglyOils aren't considered a separate food group, but they do provide some nutrients necessary for a healthy diet, and they are the major source of vitamin E in the typical American diet. Still, only small amounts of oils are necessary.Oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature, like the vegetable oils used in cooking or salad dressings. Some foods, such as nuts, certain fish, avocados, and olives, are naturally high in oils. (Two tablespoons of peanut butter contains 2 teaspoons of oil.)Most children get all the oils they need in the food they eat or in salad dressings or oils used for cooking. Children 2 to 3 years old need about 3 teaspoons of oil per day, and 4-year-olds need 4 teaspoons a day."

Picky eaters: The No-Fruit Kid,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-no-fruit-kid_10331709.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients he needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies for your no-fruit kid.See all eight picky eaters here.The No-Fruit KidThe dilemma: Your little one regards snack staples such as apple slices, orange sections, and bananas with utter disdain.The nutritional concern: Like vegetables, fruits are chock full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber  all necessary nutrients for your child's developing body.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: If you want your children to try new fruits and veggies, cook, shop, and grow healthy food with them. When kids participate in the process, they're much more likely to try new things.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: What kid do you know who doesn't like Popsicles? Make your own with pomegranate or cherry juice to get all those great nutrients in an icy cold treat. I also add a purple puree full of blueberries to meat dishes  like taco filling  to get the benefits of this vitamin-rich fruit.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: Fruits and vegetables offer a lot of the same vitamins and minerals. So if your child dislikes fruit but does eat vegetables, then she's probably getting a lot of the nutrients she needs. If she eats red peppers instead of oranges, she's still getting vitamin C.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: I have one word for you: Popsicles. Make your own using low-fat yogurt and berries. I also find that kids love things like bananas rolled in low-fat sour cream and coconut. Fruit is really versatile.Mango LassiBy Ann CooperLassis are a common Indian beverage and a great afternoon snack or breakfast beverage. Mangos are traditional in this drink, but berries, stone fruit, or any other fruit would be a delight.Ingredients:2 1/2 cups mangos, peeled, pitted, and diced2 1/2 cups nonfat yogurt8 ice cubes2 cups nonfat milk (use whole milk if your child is less than 2 years old)1 1/2 tablespoons honeyCombine all ingredients in a blender until smooth.Makes 8 servings. Sneaky Chef Brainy BrowniesBy Missy Chase LapineThese original brownies (with hidden spinach, blueberries, and wheat germ!) passed the sneaky taste test among unsuspecting kids on The Today Show.Ingredients:6 tablespoons unsalted butter3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips2 large eggs2 teaspoons vanilla extract1/2 cup sugar1/2 cup Purple Puree (recipe below)1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Flour Blend (equal parts all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and wheat germ)1/4 cup rolled oats, ground in a food processor1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder1/4 teaspoon salt1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)Butter or nonstick cooking sprayInstructions:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter or spray only the bottom, not the sides, of a 13-by-9-inch or a 9-inch-square baking pan.Melt the butter and chocolate chips together in a double boiler or metal bowl over simmering water (or in a microwave, checking every 15 seconds). Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool a bit.Meanwhile, in another bowl, stir together the eggs, vanilla, sugar, and Purple Puree. Combine this purple egg mixture with the cooled chocolate mixture.In a mixing bowl, stir together Flour Blend, cocoa powder, oats, and salt. Add this to the chocolate mixture and blend thoroughly. Mix in the chopped walnuts, if using, then pour the entire mixture into the baking pan.Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool completely in the pan before cutting the brownies. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired.Brownies will keep for a week in the refrigerator, covered tightly.Makes about 30 kid-size brownies.Note: Use a plastic knife for easier cutting if you're going to eat the brownies while warm.Purple PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or frozen chopped collard greens)1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)1/2 teaspoon lemon juice1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Wash raw spinach thoroughly, even if the package says ""prewashed."" Bring spinach or collards and water to a boil in a medium pot. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked greens, along with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water. Puree on high until as smooth as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape sides. If necessary, use a second tablespoon of water to make a fairly smooth puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 1 cup of puree.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Banana Cream PieBy Jennifer IserlohThis low-fat, slightly sweetened banana cream pie is 50 percent lower in fat and calories than its sugary counterpart. It's also loaded with potassium, vitamin C, and fiber. Finally, a snack that is sweet and substantial.Ingredients:2 large bananas, sliced1 cup low-fat or nonfat sour cream2 tablespoons brown sugar1 tablespoon reduced fat margarine1 teaspoon lemon zest4 low-fat graham crackers, crumbledNonfat cooking sprayInstructions:In a large shallow dish or pie plate, combine sour cream, 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar, and lemon zest. Set aside.Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat the margarine over medium-high heat. When it foams, add bananas and sprinkle with remaining brown sugar.Cook 3 to 4 minutes total until both sides are lightly browned. Spoon bananas onto sour cream and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs. Serve immediately.Makes 4 servings.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012. Dietary fat and toddlers.

How to eat when you're trying to conceive,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-eat-when-youre-trying-to-conceive_1460692.bc,"If you're trying to get pregnant, practicing good eating habits now can help you have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive.""What you eat affects everything from your blood to your cells to your hormones,"" says Cynthia Stadd, a nutrition specialist at the Berkley Center for Reproductive Wellness in New York City.But no matter how balanced your diet is, it's still important to take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. Most experts recommend that all women start taking folic acid at least a month before trying to get pregnant.Read on for more tips about eating a healthy diet while trying to conceive.Curb caffeineIt's unclear whether caffeine can affect fertility. There's some evidence that very high consumption  more than 500 milligrams a day, or about three to four 8-ounce cups of coffee depending on the strength of the brew  might interfere with fertility. But experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption (less than 300 milligrams a day, or about two 8-ounce cups of coffee) shouldn't make it harder for you to get pregnant.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

Fruits and vegetables deliver a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and getting enough of certain nutrients is especially important before you conceive.For example, veggies like spinach, romaine lettuce, asparagus, and broccoli are high in the B vitamin folate. (Folic acid is the synthetic form.) Eating foods rich in folate during preconception and pregnancy can help prevent neural tube birth defects, such as spina bifida. Produce that's high in vitamin C  such as citrus fruit, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes  can help your body absorb iron more easily, and iron is an important mineral for women who become pregnant. (See ""Pump up your iron intake"" below.)In general, choose fruits and vegetables in a range of colors to get the most nutritional bang for your buck. (Eating a produce ""rainbow"" gives you a wider variety of nutrients.) Choose fishSeafood is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, and according to some scientists, these essential fats may have a positive effect on fertility. Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help regulate ovulation, improve egg quality, and even delay aging of the ovaries.Omega-3s are also important for a baby's brain and eye development and could have many other pregnancy-related benefits. These include lowering your risk ofpreterm birth, reducing your chance of preeclampsia, and easingdepression.On the other hand, you've probably also heard that some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. In high doses, this metal is harmful to a baby's developing brain and nervous system.The good news is that not all fish contain a lot of mercury. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that women trying to conceive can safely eat up to 12 ounces (roughly two or three servings) a week of fish like canned light tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, tilapia, and catfish.However, the FDA advises limiting white (albacore) tuna and completely avoiding fresh or frozen swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel, and shark because these have the highest mercury levels.You can take fish oil supplements if you don't like seafood, but first talk to your doctor about which brand to buy and how much you should take.Read our article oneating fish when you're trying to conceivefor more advice on mercury and omega-3s.Pump up your iron intakeFill your body's iron reserves before you get pregnant, especially if your periods are heavy. According to Sam Thatcher, a reproductive endocrinologist and author ofMaking a Baby: Everything You Need to Know to Get Pregnant, ""Bleeding every month is a constant source of iron depletion.""Make sure to get enough iron now  once you're expecting, it's difficult for your body to maintain its iron level because your developing baby uses up your stores of the mineral. (Pregnant women need double the amount of iron they needed before pregnancy.)Too little iron at conception not only can affect your baby, it can also put you at risk for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy and after you give birth (especially if you lose a lot of blood during delivery). Anemia causes your red blood cells to fall below normal and saps your energy.If you don't eat much red meat, or if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prenatal vitamin containing extra iron. And to be on the safe side, ask your healthcare provider to test you for anemia at your preconception checkup. Eat whole grainsA woman trying to conceive should eat as many nutrient-rich foods as possible, and whole grains are a great place to start, says nutrition specialist Stadd.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food guidelines recommend that you make at least half of the grains you eat each day whole grains (such as bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, or whole wheat bread). Refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pasta, and white rice) won't directly lower your chance of getting pregnant, but they do shortchange your body because the refining process strips grains of key nutrients such as fiber, some B vitamins, and iron.Note: If you havepolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), the most common cause of infertility in women, pay extra attention to the types of carbs you eat. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can get worse when insulin levels in the bloodstream surge, and refined carbohydrates are a main cause of insulin spikes.Mark Leondires, fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut, explains that when women with PCOS eat too many refined carbohydrates, insulin flows into the blood, feeds back to the ovaries, and can lead to irregular ovulation.Avoid alcoholAn occasional beer or glass of wine probably won't hurt your odds of conceiving, but having two or more drinks a day can. Moderate drinking can also increase your risk of miscarriage. You may want to skip alcohol completely when you're trying to conceive because it can be hard to tell exactly when you get pregnant, and alcohol can harm a developing baby.For nonalcoholic alternatives, see our list of thebest ""virgin"" drinks.Be aware of listeriaListeriais a bacterium that can contaminate lunchmeats, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized dairy products. Pregnant women are more likely than other healthy adults to get sick from eating contaminated food, and the infection caused by listeria (listeriosis)can cause amiscarriageearly in the first trimester  possibly before you even know you're pregnant.To kill listeria, heat high-risk foods in the microwave until they're steaming hot. To reduce bacteria growth on leftovers, set the refrigerator's temperature to 40 degrees or less. Toss any food that's been at room temperature for more than two hours.Do not eat these foods:raw fish and sushi, refrigerated smoked seafood (like lox), soft cheesemade from unpasteurized (raw) milk, other unpasteurized dairy products, and refrigerated pt or meat spreads. (Canned or shelf-stable spreads are safe to eat.) Choose other proteinsProtein is a critical part of a healthy diet, but according to the USDA, many Americans rely too heavily on beef, pork, and chicken to get their daily amount. In a study of 18,555 women, experts at Harvard Medical School found that those who included one daily serving of vegetable protein  such as nuts, beans, peas, soybeans or tofu  were less likely to have infertility due to ovulation problems.More research is needed on the link to fertility, but because vegetable proteins are usually lower in fat and calories than steak or fried chicken, including them in your meal plans is both good for you and a great way to maintain a healthy weight.To get a personalized nutrition plan that includes the amount of protein, grains, and produce you should eat daily, try the USDA's SuperTracker tool.What about hisdiet?When it comes to fertility and diet, men don't get a free pass. Lisa Mazzullo, an ob-gyn and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, recommends that fathers-to-be take a daily multivitamin that contains zinc and selenium for at least three months before conception. Studies suggest these minerals aid in healthy sperm development.Why start so early? The sperm your partner ejaculates today was actually created more than two months ago. It takes about 74 days for sperm to fully develop and benefit from the supplementation.""Genetic preparation is going on during sperm development, so that's pretty heavy stuff,"" says Amy Ogle, a registered dietitian in San Diego, California, and coauthor ofBefore Your Pregnancy: A 90-Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception.Learn more:Dietary changes men can make to boost fertilityFolic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancyPrenatal vitamins: Why they're so importantEating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3sUSDA SuperTracker tool: Get your personalized nutrition planShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Top cold and flu myths – and the facts on keeping your child healthy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-cold-and-flu-myths-160-8211-and-the-facts-on-keeping-you_1448773.bc,"A typical child will catch five to eight colds this year  maybe more, if friends or siblings are around sharing their germs. Throw in a bout with the flu, and your little one could spend a lot of time sniffling, sneezing, and feeling miserable.While you can't entirely germ-proof your child, you can learn to separate fact from fiction, keep your family healthier, and save time, money, and frustration. Start by putting some of the more common myths and misunderstandings to rest. And be sure to check out our article onhome remedies.Myth 1: Over-the-counter cough and cold remedies work well for children.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says over-the-counter medicines for relieving stuffiness, runny noses, and coughs are not effective for kids younger than 6, and can have harmful side effects. If your child is under 6, soothe his symptoms with childrens acetaminophen or ibuprofen and safe home remedies.A 2004 study, for example, found that common medicated cough syrups worked no better than the same amount of unmedicated syrup. And a 2007 study found that honey worked better than cough syrup for kids 2 and older.OTC medicines can also be dangerous, especially when a child mistakenly gets more than the recommended dose.In addition to side effects like drowsiness or sleeplessness, upset stomach, and a rash or hives, kids can suffer serious effects such as rapid heart rate, convulsions, and even death. Every year, 7,000 children under the age of 11 are treated in U.S. emergency rooms after taking too much cough or cold medication.How do accidental overdoses happen?Self-medicating kids:As any emergency room worker will tell you, children find medicine and take it without adult supervision.What you can do:Keep all medicines out of reach in childproof containers.Too many cooks:Two or more adults (say, a parent and a babysitter) medicate a child without telling each other.What you can do:Make sure every caregiver knows whose job it is to give it your child medicine, and when. You may want to attach a schedule to the bottle with a signoff spot for each dose.Dueling medicines:A child receives a dose of more than one medicine with the same active ingredient.What you can do:Read labels carefully, noting what the active ingredients are, and don't give your child two medicines with similar active ingredients. This includes decongestants, cough suppressants, expectorants, antihistamines,acetaminophen, andibuprofen.Measuring mistakes:One study found that 70 percent of parents have trouble getting the dose right.What you can do:Carefully measure the dosage as directed, using the measuring device included with the medicine.Find out more aboutGiving kidsOTC cough and cold medicinesAlternatives to medicine:Safe home remediesTreating your baby'scoldorfluTreating your toddler'scoldorfluTreating your preschooler'scoldorfluTreating your older child'scoldorfluGiving medicines safelyand effectivelyMyth 2: Antibiotics can kill the germs that cause colds and the flu.Treating a cold or flu with antibiotics is like using nose drops to treat a hangnail. That's because antibiotics kill bacteria, and colds and flu are caused by viruses, a class of germs that aren't anything like bacteria.Healthcare providers work hard to dispel this myth, but it just won't go away. Worried parents pressure doctors for antibiotics to help their children feel better, but facts are facts: No antibiotic from Amoxil to Zithromax will help a cold or flu.Lack of effectiveness isn't the only reason to avoid unnecessary antibiotics. The drugs can have unpleasant side effects such as diarrhea and stomach cramps. And disease-causing bacteria can gradually build up a resistance to the drugs, making actual bacterial infections harder to treat.On the other hand, if your child develops a complication of a cold or flu that involves bacteria, an antibiotic may prove helpful. This might be the case if she develops an ear infection, bronchitis, or pneumonia, for example.Myth 3: There's really no difference between the flu and a bad cold.It can be hard to tell the difference between the flu and a bad cold at first. But colds almost always go away without causing any real trouble, while the flu can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia. Recognizing the flu early on can help you treat it appropriately and possibly ward off complications.If your child is at high risk for complications because of an underlying medical condition, quickly spotting a case of the flu can open up possibilities for treatment. If your child is 1 or older, he can receive antiviral drugs, which kill the virus that causes the flu and speed recovery by a day or two. But antiviral drugs only work if taken in the first two days of the illness. Once the 48-hour window closes, they're no longer effective.Here's help distinguishing a cold from a case of the flu:Colds usually come on slowly. The first sign is often a sore, scratchy throat, followed by sneezing and a runny nose with clear mucus that may thicken and turn gray, yellow, or green in the following week or so. Other common symptoms include a cough, a mild headache, watery eyes, mild fatigue, and a stuffy nose.By contrast, flu usually hits like a truck. The symptoms come on quickly and tend to be severe. Your child feels very weak, tired, and achy. He may have a dry cough, a runny nose, chills, a sore throat, swollen glands, a bad headache, and eye pain. His appetite may be poor. In babies and children, the flu can also bring on abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. (The symptoms of the swine flu are the same as those of the seasonal flu.)If your child acts better (or somewhat better) after his fever comes down, he probably has a cold. If he acts ill even when his temperature drops, it's more likely he has the flu.If you're having trouble identifying your child's illness or are concerned about his symptoms, call your child's doctor. Sometimes it takes a lab test to tell a cold from the flu.Read more about how to tell whether yourbaby,toddler,preschooler, or older childhas a cold or something more serious.Myth 4: It's a good idea to take your children to the doctor when they have a cold.Every year, 1 billion colds strike in the United States. So it's no surprise that the common cold is the number one reason people head to the doctor's office. But almost all those visits are unnecessary because a doctor can't do anything to reduce the length or severity of a cold.If it's really a cold and not something more serious (see Myth 3 for how to tell the difference), keep your child at home. She probably just needs time to get over the virus. You'll save time, money, and exposure to even more germs.A few kids with a cold do need medical help, though. Likewise, some kids with the flu develop complications that require immediate attention. And if your child is younger than 3 months, call the doctor at thefirst sign of any illness.Myth 5: Getting the flu vaccine is more important for adults than for kids.Actually, being immunized against the flu is just as important for children as it is for adults.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearlyflu shot(starting at age 6 months) for almost everyone, young and old preferably in October or November to allow time for immunity to develop before flu season gets into full swing.Children under 5 are especially vulnerable to the flu because they're at high risk for serious flu-related complications like pneumonia. Every year in the United States, more than 20,000 children under age 5 are hospitalized with the flu. The CDC also stresses the importance of the vaccine for household contacts and caregivers of children under age 5.Tell us:Will your child get the flu vaccine this year?Will you get the flu or swine flu vaccine this year?Myth 6: You can catch the flu from a flu shot.The flu and swine flu shots are made from inactivated (killed) viruses. And it's impossible to catch an illness from a dead virus.You may wonder about that, though, if your child has any of the possible side effects of the shot: a low-grade fever, aches, soreness, swelling, or redness where the shot was given. These symptoms may be uncomfortable, but they're a reaction to the shot, not signs of infection.Find out more about getting theflu shot for your child.Myth 7: Dietary supplements such as zinc, vitamin C, and echinacea can ease children's cold symptoms.Maybe, maybe not. Lots of people swear that taking vitamin C at the first sign of a cold, sucking on a zinc lozenge when a sore throat strikes, or boosting their immunity with echinacea works every time.There's some research to support each of these remedies. Trouble is, there's also research to dispute their effectiveness.You'll find popular OTC remedies that rely on these supplements. Airborne, an OTC herbal remedy that claims to boost immunity, for example, contains echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc. And Gesundheit, a skin patch remedy, contains vitamins C and A, echinacea, and other herbs. But the fact that they're popular doesn't mean that they work or that they're safe.Before giving your child any type of dietary supplement, in any form, talk with her doctor. Even ""natural"" remedies can be harmful for example, the Chinese herb ma huang, also known as ephedra or ephedrine. In adults this herbal decongestant has been linked to high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, and strokes.ZincStudies on zinc have produced mixed results. Some have found that zinc is merely a placebo. Others report that it reduces the length of colds.Zinc can have side effects, too. Lawsuits against the manufacturer of zinc in nasal spray form, for example, alleged that the product caused permanent damage to the sense of smell. And high doses, which could result from long-term use or inadvertent overdosing, can be toxic.Vitamin CVitamin C has long been touted for its ability to fight off colds. But in 2007, when researchers reviewed 30 long-term studies involving more than 11,000 adults over several decades, they found that daily doses of at least 200 milligrams of vitamin C do little to reduce the symptoms or duration of a cold in most people.Side effects usually aren't a problem with vitamin C, although very large amounts can cause diarrhea and stomach upset. The vitamin is water soluble, so it's not stored in the body and doesn't build up to toxic levels.EchinaceaThe herb echinacea receives mixed reviews, too. Some studies show no benefit, while others report a reduction in the severity and duration of a cold when it's taken at the beginning of an illness.In one study, 524 cold-infected kids ages 2 to 11 showed no improvement when given echinacea versus a placebo. Another study found that children who took it when they had a cold were less likely to have colds in the months that followed. A third study concluded that the herb did little to prevent or shorten a cold.Finally, a review published in 2007 of more than 700 studies concluded that echinacea reduced the risk of catching a cold by 58 percent and made colds go away faster when taken soon after symptoms appeared.Myth 8: Kids in daycare catch more colds than other children.There's truth behind the stereotype of the runny-nosed daycare kid. In the first year of daycare, kids really are more likely to catch colds than kids who are kept at home.But according to a study of more than 135,000 children in Denmark from 1989 to 2004, the risk of infection goes down as a child continues to attend daycare. And after one year in daycare, a child is at no greater risk of illness than a child who stays at home.That early exposure to germs may reap benefits in the long run, too. A 2002 study published in theArchives of Adolescent and Pediatric Medicinefound that kids who attended large daycares as preschoolers suffered fewer colds in later years (up to age 13), presumably because they had built up immunity to most common cold viruses.Myth 9: Breathing the same air as a sick person is the surest way to catch a cold.It's true that cold viruses travel through the air, especially when a sick person coughs or sneezes. But that's only one of the ways that a virus finds its next victim.Viruses can also hitch a ride on your hands. If you touch something that has a virus on it such as a telephone, a toy, or a friend's hand the germs that stick to your hand can easily enter your body if you rub your eyes or nose, their favorite entryways. Common cold viruses can live for three hours on skin or other surfaces.Myth 10: Being cold or wet can make you catch a cold.Only a cold virus can give you a cold. So being cold, in itself, can't make you sick. But being cold and wetcancause a dormant virus (one that's already in your system) to flare up, triggering symptoms.In a 2005 study at Cardiff University's Common Cold Center in Wales, 90 volunteers immersed their feet in ice water for 20 minutes. Over the next five days, the chilled group had twice as many colds as a control group of 90 volunteers whose feet had not been not chilled.The researchers suggest that being chilled causes the blood vessels in the nose to constrict, shutting off the warm blood that supplies infection-fighting white blood cells. Many people are carrying around cold germs, they explain, but getting chilled can make it harder to fight off the effects.So go ahead and tell your child to bundle up and stay dry. Just leave out the ""or you'll catch your death"" part.Myth 11: If you catch a cold, it means your immune system is weak.Perfectly healthy people succumb to cold viruses all the time. In one study, about 95 percent of volunteers became infected with the cold virus when the virus was dropped in their nose. Not everyone infected with a virus actually comes down with a cold, though. About 75 percent of the volunteers who were infected showed symptoms.Some studies do suggest that lower immunity (from chronic illness or stress, for example) can make cold symptoms worse. But a healthy child can easily become infected with one of at least 200 different viruses that cause the common cold.Myth 12: Drinking milk causes the body to produce more mucus.People hotly debate this point, but researchers say there's no need to hide the milk from your child when he has a cold. Several studies have tracked the milk consumption of adults infected with a cold virus. They found no link between dairy consumption and mucus production or any other cold symptoms, for that matter.In one study, researchers found that among the people studied who had a cough, those who drank more milk had a ""looser"" cough.Myth 13: You should feed a cold and starve a fever.There may an inkling of truth to this one, according to Dutch scientists who tested the theory in 2002.Feeding some ill volunteers and giving others only water, the researchers discovered that eating boosts the immune response that attacks cold viruses, while fasting stimulates the response that attacks bacterial infections, which are responsible for many fevers. One problem with their conclusion is that the flu is also likely to cause a fever but, like colds, it's caused by a virus.Many experts still say the old adage is a myth. In any case, the best advice is to follow your child's cues. A sick child needs nourishment for strength and help fighting the infection. But don't force a child who's not hungry to eat. Do make sure your sick child gets plenty of fluids, though, to prevent dehydration.Find out more about getting the flushotfor your child."
The worst foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-worst-foods-for-babies_10320507.bc,"Babies don't need many calories, but they do need lots of nutrients. Yet some foods commonly offered to babies are essentially junk food  high in calories, sugar, or salt, and low in nutrients.Because babies are so small, it's easy for them to fill up quickly on the empty calories in junk food, leaving no room for nutrient-rich healthy foods. This nutritional deficit can even hinder development, says doctor and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson Christine Gerbstadt.That's why it's important to know which foods are best for babies and which ones to avoid, including junk food and potential choking hazards. Here's our list of the worst food choices for babies.Hot dogs and other dangerous foodsHard, sticky, slippery, chunky, and round foods are unsafe for young children because they can easily choke on them. So don't give your baby hot dogs, sausages, large pieces of meat or cheese, whole grapes, popcorn, chunky raw vegetables, and whole nuts and seeds.And once you start serving your baby finger foods, be sure to cut food into pieces no larger than half an inch.SodaSome babies are served soft drinks daily as early as 9 months of age, according to a 2008 survey of infant and toddler feeding habits. The same survey found that by 24 months, more than 10 percent of toddlers were drinking soda every day.Whether regular or diet, soda provides absolutely no nutrients, and filling up on either type means babies eat and drink less of the nutritious food their bodies really need. Regular soda also contains loads of sugar, which can cause tooth decay.How to care for your baby's teeth and gums Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 5:07Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -5:07Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosFrench friesAnother major 2008 study found that about 14 percent of 9-month-olds eat fries at least once a week. That figure goes up to more than 40 percent by 12 months of age, making french fries among the top vegetables consumed by toddlers  and marking the start of an unhealthy habit.It's a good idea to minimize all fast food because it's loaded with fat, sugar, salt, and calories but low in healthy nutrients. If you do need to grab a bite on the go, look for baby-friendly options. Many chains now offer healthier choices, including yogurt and applesauce.Processed foodsPeople define 'processed' in different ways, but in general, the more the food is modified from what was originally caught, raised, or grown  and the longer the list of ingredients  the more processed it is.""The more processed the food, the more nutritional value tends to go down, and the more the sugar, salt, and fat content goes up,"" says Kate Geagan, dietitian and author ofGo Green, Get Lean.Meals made specifically for babies can be healthy and appropriate. The best prepared baby foods have few ingredients and no added salt, sugar, or modified food starch.But ready-to-eat foods meant for older children and adults are definitely not good for babies. ""They often contain way too much sodium,"" says dietitian Eileen Behan, author ofThe Baby Food Bible.For example, instead of serving canned pasta entrees, it's better to boil some noodles and sprinkle some cheese on top. And instead of serving deli meats, which are often high in sodium and carry a risk of food poisoning, cut up small bits of roast chicken or hamburger.Gelatin dessertsMost varieties are nearly all sugar, artificial color, and artificial flavor with a small amount of gelatin to make it wiggly. Homemade gelatin made with fruit juice and sugar eliminates the artificial additives, but it's still essentially just fruit juice and sweetener.True, gelatin is easy to swallow, but so is Gerbstadt's suggestion for a healthy, baby-friendly dessert: a baked, mashed apple with a sprinkle of cinnamon. ""It's naturally sweet and has good fiber, vitamins, and a yummy, smooth texture,"" she says.Juice and fruit drinksSure, these beverages contain fruit, but that doesn't mean they're healthy. The fiber in fresh fruit is largely lost in the juicing process, and what's left is a whole lot of sugar. Juice can also cause diarrhea in some babies.""Juice is basically a waste of calories,"" says pediatrician Ari Brown, coauthor of Baby 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Baby's First Year. Using juice to sweeten your baby's food isn't a good idea either: The sugars in juice can make food pass through the digestive tract more quickly, interfering with the body's ability to absorb nutrients.And don't be fooled by advertisers' claims that juice provides babies with necessary vitamin C. ""Babies can easily get their vitamin C from one small serving of fruit,"" says Brown.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies younger than 6 months drink only breast milk or formula.If your baby is 6 months or older and you decide to give her juice, do it sparingly. The AAP recommends offering your baby no more than 4 to 6 ounces of 100 percent fruit juice a day. (Don't serve anything labeled fruit ""drink,"" ""cocktail,"" or ""beverage"" because these often contain only a tiny amount of juice and a lot of water, sweetener, and food coloring.)Babies 6 to 12 months old can have small amounts of water, but breast milk or formula should still be their main beverage.

Iron in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-childs-diet_10324691.bc,"Iron is crucial for children's health and development. Read on to find out how much iron your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy iron is importantIron is important for making hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood, and myoglobin, a pigment that stores oxygen in muscles. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the United States, and a lack of iron can causeanemia, resulting in fatigue and weakness.Iron also affects brain development, so anemia can also cause long-lasting problems with cognitive development. A severe iron deficiency can be life-threatening.How much iron does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 7 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 10 mg dailyIf your child eats a vegetarian diet, aim for twice as much iron because iron from nonanimal sources is harder for the body to absorb.Your child doesn't have to get enough iron every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Child Height PredictorFind out how tall your child is likely to be at age 18.Animal sources and plant sources of iron: What's the difference?Heme iron  the kind you get from animal sources such as meat, seafood, and poultry  is easily absorbed by the body. The body needs help to absorb nonheme iron, which is the kind found in nonanimal sources like dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, fortified bread and grains, and dried fruit. (Egg yolks contain mostly nonheme iron.)You can increase the amount of nonheme iron the body absorbs by serving it with foods that contain heme iron or with foods rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, oranges, strawberries, red and green bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, grapefruit, cantaloupe, tomatoes, broccoli, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.This is especially important for children eating vegetarian diets: They need to focus on eating plenty of iron-rich foods with foods high in vitamin C to boost absorption.Good sources of ironIron can be found in a variety of foods. Here are some good sources:1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 12 mg1/2 cup fortified oatmeal, prepared with water: 5 mg1/4 cup raw tofu: 2.22 mg (The iron content of tofu varies by type, so check the label.)1/4 cup soybeans: 2 mg1/4 cup boiled lentils: 2 mg1/4 cup baked beans with pork and tomato sauce: 2 mg1/4 cup navy beans: 1 mg1/4 cup kidney beans: 1 mg1 ounce braised lean beef, chuck: 1 mg1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses: 1 mg1/2 medium broiled hamburger (1.5 oz.), 95 percent lean: 1 mg1/4 cup garbanzo beans: 1 mg1/4 cup cooked frozen spinach: 0.9 mg1/4 cup black beans: 0.9 mg1/4 cup pinto beans: 0.9 mgOne slice whole wheat bread: 0.9 mg1/4 cup raisins: 0.7 mgThe amount of iron in a food varies somewhat, depending on brand of the product or the cut of the meat. Note that raisins and other chunky foods (like beans) are choking hazards for very young children. Mash or cut these foods into small pieces.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much iron?Yes. Although it's essentially impossible to get too much iron from food, supplements are another matter. Excessive iron from supplements can be toxic to children, causing serious health problems or even death. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for iron is 40 mg per day for children age 13 and younger. That's the maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.If you're concerned that your child isn't getting enough iron, talk to his doctor before giving your child a supplement.And always keep iron supplements locked up and out of sight  it's easy for curious little hands to get into medicine and supplements when you're not looking. And never encourage kids to take chewable vitamins as a ""treat,"" or they may take them when you're not looking.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

5 energy-boosting tips,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-energy-boosting-tips_10352379.bc,"You were up all night with a fussy baby and you can barely keep your eyes open. How are you going to make it through the day? Try these energy-boosting tips from psychologist Hendrie Weisinger, author of The Genius of Instinct: Reclaim Mother Nature's Tools for Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work.Get movingPut your baby in the stroller or sling and take a walk around the block. Moving your muscles increases blood flow, boosts your energy, and helps stimulate your mind. ""Motion creates emotion,"" says Weisinger. It also prompts the body to release endorphins, ""feel-good hormones"" that can improve your mood and reduce stress, a common cause of fatigue.Seek out sunlightStudies have found that exposure to light can influence our circadian rhythms, essentially telling our bodies it's time to get up. So open the window and let in the light and fresh air. Or better yet, go for a short walk. Getting ten to 15 minutes of sun exposure twice a week can also provide vitamin D, a nutrient most women could use more of. Among other things, vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, a mineral that helps keep your bones strong.Turn up the musicThere's a reason we like to dance and work out to our favorite tunes. ""Sound has a powerful effect on both your emotions and your energy level,"" says Weisinger. Why not create a playlist of uplifting songs you can listen to whenever your energy ebbs?Hang out with happy, high-energy peopleWeisinger calls it ""emotional contagion."" Surround yourself with others who are full of energy and they can lift you up. Join a stroller brigade or a postpartum yoga class and feed off the positive vibes all around you.Snack for energyOpt for whole fruits  like oranges, which are full of energy-boosting vitamin C and fiber  and steer clear of overly processed, overly salted foods, which can leave you feeling lethargic. Drink lots of water. If you need a little caffeine boost, skip the coffee and treat yourself to a small piece of dark chocolate."
Bowlegs (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_bowlegs-ages-5-to-8_68538.bc,"Could my child be bowlegged?It's absolutely normal for a baby's legs to appear bowed, so that if he were to stand up with his toes forward and his ankles touching, his knees wouldn't touch. Babies are born bowlegged because of their position in the womb.You may notice bowleggedness more as your child starts to stand and walk, but typically the legs gradually straighten out. By age 3, most kids no longer appear bowlegged. And by age 7 or 8, most children's legs have reached the angle they'll retain into adulthood.Rarely, bowlegs are caused by a vitamin D deficiency (also called rickets) or a condition called Blount's disease, a bone disorder that affects the shins. Even more uncommonly, bowlegs are caused by rare genetic disorders.How can I tell if my child is bowlegged?If your child stands with his toes forward and his ankles together and his knees don't touch, he's bowlegged. If his knees touch but his ankles don't, he's knock-kneed. (Being knock-kneed is generally most obvious between ages 3 and 6. Like bowleggedness, it usually corrects itself.)Should I mention it to the doctor?If your child is a baby or young toddler, the appearance of bowleggedness is probably normal. But if you're concerned, have the doctor check it out.If your child is just 2 years old or so, he may still appear a little bowlegged, but there should be some improvement from toddlerhood.

Vegans can use fortified soy beverages, cereals, and meat substitutes.Vitamin D: Breastfed babies should get an additional 400 IU per day from fortified cow's milk or soy milk.Calcium: Vegan babies may need calcium-fortified foods, beverages, or supplements. Check with your doctor or a dietitian.Zinc: This important nutrient helps the immune system and can be found in beans, fortified cereal, milk, and wheat germ.Iron: You can find this mineral in iron-fortified cereal or supplements. Serve with foods high in vitamin C  like oranges, tomatoes, and strawberries  to improve iron absorption.Protein: Vegetarians can get added protein from yogurt and eggs. Vegans can get plant proteins from beans, cereals, and fortified soy milk.Fiber: Good sources of fiber include whole grain breads, fortified cereals and pastas, and high-fat plant foods like sunflower butter and avocados.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Dads-to-be: Diet changes to boost your fertility,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dads-to-be-diet-changes-to-boost-your-fertility_4188.bc,"Nutrition has a direct impact on the potency of your sperm. Research shows that having a poor diet and drinking alcohol regularly, for instance, can lower the quality and quantity of sperm and make conception more difficult. And since infertility is nearly as much a man's issue as a woman's  about a third of fertility problems can be traced to men  eating healthfully now can boost your chances of conceiving a child.Additional research shows that dads who are heavy drinkers risk damaging their sperm. If you drink, have no more than one or two drinks a day.Whether drinking coffee harms or helps your fertility is less clear. The safest bet is to drink no more than a cup or two a day.Which nutrients are most important?Your diet should be every bit as balanced, varied, and nutritious as your partner's. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, research shows that a healthy diet including plenty of fish, vegetables, and whole grains means more active sperm. On the other hand, a diet high in trans fats may lower the number of sperm in semen.Some specific advice for future dads:Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. These nutrients help prevent sperm defects and boost motility (movement). An 8-ounce glass of orange juice has about 124 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. Aim to get at least 90 mg a day  more if you smoke (at least 125 mg).Get enough zinc. A lack of zinc can make sperm clump together and contribute to infertility. Great sources to help you get the 11 mg you need daily include oysters (16 mg in six medium oysters), extra-lean beef tenderloin (4.8 mg per 3-ounce serving), baked beans (3.5 mg per 1-cup serving), and dark chicken meat (2.38 mg per 3-ounce serving).Fuel up on folic acid. Studies suggest that men with low levels of this key B vitamin  the same one women need to reduce the baby's risk of neural tube birth defects  have trouble producing healthy sperm. You may be able to get the daily minimum of 400 micrograms from fortified breakfast cereals, leafy greens, legumes, and orange juice, but taking a folic acid or a multivitamin supplement for extra insurance can't hurt.Cut out (or cut back on) alcohol. An occasional drink is generally considered safe, but studies show that drinking wine, beer, or hard liquor daily can reduce testosterone levels and sperm counts and raise the number of abnormal sperm in your ejaculate.Take a multivitamin tablet every day. A pill is no substitute for a healthy diet, but a multivitamin can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you need.Show sources Hide sources American Dietetic Association. Undated.

Iron-deficiency anemia in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-in-babies_10860.bc,"My baby seems pale and weak. Could it be anemia?Yes. In fact, the most typical signs of anemia are pale skin and tiredness. Other signs include rapid heartbeat, irritability, loss of appetite, brittle nails, and a sore or swollen tongue. But it's common for a baby with anemia not to have any symptoms at all.What is anemia, and what causes it?People become anemic when red blood cells don't carry enough oxygen to the tissues in their body. Various conditions can cause anemia, including an inherited illness called sickle cell anemia, but iron deficiency is the most common cause.The human body needs iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood. If your baby doesn't get enough iron, he'll have fewer red blood cells  and the ones he has will be smaller, so his body tissues will receive less oxygen than they should.Children are especially susceptible to anemia during periods of rapid growth, when they need extra iron that they don't always get. But iron-deficiency anemia doesn't happen overnight  it's caused by a relatively severe deficiency that develops over time.Iron deficiencies can happen for several reasons, including not enough iron in the diet, ongoing blood loss (in the intestinal tract, for example), and poor absorption of iron.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Is anemia dangerous?It can be.In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, a child who's anemic could suffer permanent mental and physical problems. (While an iron deficiency can be corrected, the mental and physical impairment is not always reversible.)Iron deficiency also makes kids more susceptible to lead poisoning and infection.Is my baby at risk for anemia?Between 9 and 24 months, all children are at high risk for anemia, but these babies are at highest risk:Premature and low-birth-weight babies age 2 months old and older. Full-term infants are born with iron stores accumulated during the last months in utero. These stores can last four to six months. The iron stores of babies born prematurely may last only about two months.Babies who drink cow's milk before their first birthday. Cow's milk is low in iron. It also interferes with the body's absorption of iron, and it may replace some iron-rich foods in the diet. Milk can also irritate the lining of a baby's intestine, causing bleeding. This slow loss of blood in the stool  along with low iron intake  can cause anemia.Breastfed babies who receive no iron-fortified foods after 4 months of age. The iron in breast milk is absorbed three times better than the iron in formula, but around the time a baby starts eating solids, he needs additional iron in the form of fortified cereals and other iron-rich foods.Full-term, formula-fed babies who aren't given iron-fortified formula. Most baby formula is fortified with iron, however.Should I call the doctor?The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be screened for anemia at 12 months, or earlier if they were born prematurely. But if you notice any signs of anemia, do call your baby's doctor.To determine whether your baby is anemic, the doctor will do a blood test to measure levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells in the blood).Can I prevent my baby from becoming anemic?You can prevent your baby from developing iron deficiency anemia. Here's how:If your baby was born prematurely or at a low birth weight, talk with his doctor about iron supplements.Until he's a year old, give your baby breast milk or iron-fortified formula, not cow's milk.If your baby is 4 months old and breastfed and not yet eating solid foods, the AAP recommends giving him an iron supplement of 11 milligrams (mg) per day until he starts eating iron-rich foods.Once your baby starts eating solids, feed him iron-fortified cereal, and eventually iron-rich foods like lean meats, poultry, and fish; iron-fortified pasta, rice, and bread; leafy green vegetables; egg yolks; and legumes. (See our age-by-age guide for more details about when to feed your baby various foods.)Offer plenty of fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamin C, such as kiwi, avocado, and cantaloupe). Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron.How is anemia treated in babies?It's important to boost your baby's iron intake once he's eating solids, but dietary changes aren't always enough to correct anemia. He may also need an iron supplement, usually given in the form of drops.Iron is absorbed best on an empty stomach. But because iron can cause tummy upset (and has an unpleasant taste, besides), your doctor may suggest giving the supplement to your baby with food, breast milk, or formula. Your doctor will probably recheck your child's hemoglobin/hematocrit levels after he has been on the supplement for a month or two.It usually takes a couple of months for the blood count to return to normal, and then another six to 12 months to replenish iron stores. After that, they can probably be maintained with an iron-rich diet.Should I give my baby an iron supplement, just in case?Iron supplements are helpful in many instances, but too much iron can be poisonous, so always consult your doctor before giving your baby iron supplements. Doctors often recommend extra iron for breastfed babies starting at age 4 months. Get all the details in our expert's answer to the question ""Does my baby need an iron supplement?""If you do have iron supplements in the house (or vitamins that contain iron), make sure you keep them locked up and well out of your young child's reach.

Iron-deficiency anemia: What do I need to know before I get pregnant?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-what-do-i-need-to-know-before-i-get-p_10414719.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have iron-deficiency anemia. Do I need to see my healthcare provider before I get pregnant?Yes. If you have iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and are planning to get pregnant, visit your healthcare provider for a preconception checkup. A preconception checkup gives you the chance to discuss your condition and have a blood test to determine how severe your anemia is. (And if you're unsure about the type of anemia you have, your provider can go over your medical history to see if it might be caused by something other than iron deficiency.)Seeing your provider before you get pregnant also ensures that your anemia is managed appropriately. In most cases, mild anemia doesn't pose a problem during pregnancy if it's caught and treated early. But if your anemia is severe, your provider may refer you to a specialist.Why is iron important during pregnancy?Iron is essential for making hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around your body to other cells. Iron requirements go up significantly when you're pregnant because extra iron is needed for the placenta and growing baby.Your blood volume increases by about 50 percent during pregnancy  also increasing your need for iron. It's important that your healthcare provider knows you have anemia because it's possible you need more iron than the average pregnant woman.What causes iron-deficiency anemia?It's not unusual to develop anemia during pregnancy because of the need for more iron. But if you have anemia before you get pregnant, the most common reasons include:Having heavy periodsNot eating enough iron-rich foods. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for American women ages 19 to 50 is 18 milligrams (mg) of iron a day  and about 33 mg daily if you're a vegetarian. The typical diet supplies approximately 15 mg of iron per day.Not eating enough foods that help your body absorb ironEating too many foods that prevent the body from absorbing as much iron, such as dairy products and soy-based foodsDrinking lots of coffee or teaBeing unable to absorb iron properly. This could be due to taking certain medications, or having a condition that affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients, such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease.Previously losing a lot of blood when giving birthHaving a very short gap between pregnancies. If you're planning to have another baby, wait at least 18 months before conceiving again.Should I take a vitamin supplement?Yes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all women take prenatal vitamins when trying to get pregnant, and women with IDA take supplemental iron in addition to their prenatal vitamin.What else can I do to prepare for pregnancy?Try to eat plenty of iron-rich foods, such as beef, shrimp, beans, lentils, and enriched breakfast cereals.Eat iron-rich foods at the same time as foods that enhance iron absorption, like orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, and peppers.Try not to eat foods that prevent iron absorption at the same time you eat iron-rich foods. Key culprits are dairy products, soy products, coffee, and tea.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

If your body lacks the right amount of iron, you could become anemic.As a woman, it's not unusual to have anemia, especially when you're of childbearing age. Iron deficiency is by far the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy and accounts for 75 to 95 percent of all cases.But it's not the only cause: You could also develop anemia from not getting enough folic acid or vitamin B12, by losing a lot of blood, or from having certain diseases or inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia.Am I at risk of becoming anemic?Yes. Pregnancy increases your likelihood of becoming anemic.During pregnancy, the recommended amount of iron increases from 18 milligrams (mg) per day to 27 mg per day. You need extra iron to support additional red blood cells, the placenta, and your growing baby. Plus, the extra iron prepares your body for any blood loss that may occur when you give birth.But there are other factors outside pregnancy that increase your risk further, including:Heavy menstrual periodsA diet low in iron-rich foodsA diet low in vitamin-C-rich foods (which help with iron absorption)Eating too many foods or drinks that reduce iron absorption (like dairy products, foods containing soy, coffee and tea)A short gap between pregnanciesBeing younger than 20 when you become pregnantHaving a stomach or intestinal disease that affects how your body absorbs nutrientsHaving certain types of gastric bypass surgery, which alters the gut and absorption of nutrientsTaking medication that affects the way your body absorbs iron from foodLosing more blood than normal when giving birth previouslyWhat are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?You might not have any symptoms, especially if your anemia is mild. Sometimes tiredness is the only symptom you notice. And it's common to feel tired during pregnancy, so many women don't realize that a lack of iron is making them feel more tired than normal.Fatigue and weakness are the most common symptoms of severe anemia. Other symptoms include:Shortness of breathDizzinessHeadachePale complexionPalpitationsChest painIrritability or poor concentrationAn unpleasant urge to move your legs during periods of inactivity (restless legs syndrome)Leg crampsCraving nonfood items (pica) or ice to suck or chew onPale lips, inner eyelids, and the inside of your mouthSpoon-shaped nailsGlossy tongueCracks in the corners of your mouthHow is anemia diagnosed?At your first prenatal appointment, your provider will evaluate your medical history, give you a physical exam, and test your blood for anemia.One of the blood tests you'll have is a complete blood count (CBC). Among other things, the CBC measures:The percentage of red blood cells in your bloodstream (hematocrit or Hct)The amount of hemoglobin (Hgb or Hb) in those red blood cellsBlood test resultsThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control give guidelines for diagnosing anemia. In the first and third trimesters, an Hct less than 33 percent and an Hgb level less than 11 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood suggest anemia. In the second trimester, the levels are a little lower: 32 percent Hct and 10.5 g/dL Hgb.Your provider may follow up your CBC with more tests to determine if iron deficiency is the cause of your anemia.Even if you're not anemic at the start of your pregnancy, it's not unusual to develop anemia as your pregnancy progresses, so you may be tested again later on.How will anemia affect my pregnancy?It's normal to feel worried about being diagnosed with anemia, but mild anemia that's diagnosed and treated early shouldn't pose a problem during your pregnancy. Most experts agree that anemia in pregnancy is more of a concern if it's severe, untreated, or lasts a long time.If your provider advises you take iron supplements, and you take them as prescribed, your condition should improve. If you have a more severe case of anemia, you may be treated with IV iron supplements, or possibly even a blood transfusion if your hemoglobin falls to 6 g/dL or less.If you have severe anemia, and it doesn't get better with initial treatment, your healthcare provider may refer you to a specialist for care. You may need to see a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist to figure out if another condition is causing your anemia.When you have a low level of iron, you may find yourself getting more tired or fatigued more easily during your pregnancy. Pregnancy can be exhausting anyway, so take extra care of yourself if you're feeling the added strain of having low iron.Will my baby be affected?A mild iron deficiency shouldn't affect your baby while you're pregnant. But research also suggests that mild iron-deficiency anemia that goes untreated and becomes more severe during pregnancy  especially in the first two trimesters  is linked to an increased risk of a baby being born with a low birth weight.Having severe iron-deficiency anemia may even increase the risk of stillbirth and newborn death.What can I do to have a healthy pregnancy?Let your provider know if you were diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia before you became pregnant. That way, she can manage your condition and treat you effectively during preconception and throughout your pregnancy.As with any pregnancy, go to all your appointments, take your prenatal vitamins, and follow the advice of your healthcare provider. She may suggest that you take iron supplements or modify the foods you eat.You can improve your anemia by eating iron-rich foods, such as shrimp, beef, turkey, enriched breakfast cereals, beans, and lentils. Foods that enhance iron absorption are also beneficial to include, such as orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, grapefruit, and peppers.Avoid consuming too many foods or drinks that prevent your body from absorbing iron properly, such as dairy products, soy products, coffee, and tea. If you do consume these foods or drinks, it may be best to have them an hour before or two hours after an iron-rich meal.Also, when you take an iron supplement, have it with a small snack. Eating a large amount of food hinders iron absorption.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources AAP and ACOG. 2012.

Folic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_folic-acid-why-you-need-it-before-and-during-pregnancy_476.bc,"Why you need folic acidIf you're pregnant or might become pregnant, it's critically important to get enough folic acid, the synthetic form of vitamin B9, also known as folate.Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects (NTDs)  serious birth defects of the spinal cord (such as spina bifida) and the brain (such as anencephaly). The neural tube is the part of the embryo from which your baby's spine and brain develop. NTDs affect about 3,000 pregnancies a year in the United States.Neural tube defects occur at a very early stage of development, before many women even know they're pregnant  which is why it's important to begin taking folic acid before you start trying to conceive.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that women who take the recommended daily dose of folic acid starting at least one month before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy reduce their baby's risk of neural tube defects by up to 70 percent.Some research suggests that folic acid may help lower your baby's risk of other defects as well, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and certain types of heart defects. It may also reduce your risk of preeclampsia, a serious blood pressure disorder that affects about 5 percent of pregnant women.What else does folic acid do for you? Your body needs this nutrient to make normal red blood cells and prevent a type of anemia. It's also essential for the production, repair, and functioning of DNA, our genetic map and a basic building block of cells. Getting enough folic acid is particularly important for the rapid cell growth of the placenta and your developing baby.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosHow much folic acid you needTo reduce your baby's risk of developing a neural tube defect, experts recommend that you take 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a day, beginning at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant.In fact, because half of the pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, the CDC, the U.S. Public Health Service, the March of Dimes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and other experts strongly recommend that all women of childbearing age get 400 mcg of folic acid every day.Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg daily once you're pregnant.Check the label of your multivitamin supplement to be sure you're getting enough. If you're not, you can switch brands or take folic acid separately. (Never take more than one multivitamin a day.)If you're taking prescription prenatal vitamins, they probably contain 800 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid. Again, check the label.Don't take more than 1,000 mcg per day of folic acid unless your healthcare provider advises you to. This is particularly important if you are a vegan. Vegans are at risk of being deficient in vitamin B12 and taking too much folic acid would make it hard to diagnose that deficiency. When you might need extra folic acidWomen who are obese appear to be more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect. If you're significantly overweight, see your healthcare provider before you try to conceive. She may advise you to take more than 400 mcg of folic acid a day.If you've previously been pregnant with a baby with a neural tube defect, you'll probably be advised to take 4,000 mcg of folic acid a day. Be sure your current providers are aware of your history and schedule a visit before you try to get pregnant. With no intervention, women in this situation have a 3 to 5 percent chance of having another pregnancy complicated by an NTD.Are you pregnant?Take our quiz and find outIf you're carrying twins, your healthcare provider may recommend you take as much as 1,000 mcg of folic acid per day.Some people have a genetic variation  known as a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation  that makes it more difficult to process folate and folic acid. If you know you have this mutation, talk with your doctor to make sure you're getting enough folic acid.Women who are diabetic or are taking certain antiseizure medications are also more likely to have a baby with an NTD. If either of these situations applies to you, see your provider at least a month before trying to conceive to find out how much folic acid you should be taking and to monitor your condition in general.Food sources of folic acidFood manufacturers are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to add folic acid to enriched grain products, such as breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, and rice. Some fortified breakfast cereals contain 100 percent of the recommended daily amount.This is meant to be helpful for women who don't take a supplement and aren't planning to get pregnant, but most women don't eat these foods consistently enough to rely on them as a source of folic acid.Even if you eat a complete serving of a fully fortified cereal every day, you can't be sure you're getting what you need. (For one thing, synthetic nutrients added to cereals tend to end up in the milk at the bottom of the bowl.)Foods that are naturally rich in folate are not a good source either. Oddly enough, research shows that the body absorbs folic acid from supplements much better than the folate that occurs naturally in certain foods. What's more, folate can be lost from foods during storage or destroyed by cooking.So if you eat foods rich in folate, consider them a complement to your supplement. Good sources include:lentilsdried beans, peas, and nutsavocadodark green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, collard or turnip greens, okra, Brussels sprouts, and asparaguscitrus fruit and juice Is a supplement recommended?Yes. As mentioned above, many authorities, including ACOG and the March of Dimes, recommend that all women of childbearing age take a multivitamin with folic acid or a folic acid supplement every single day.Signs of a folic acid deficiencyThe signs of folic acid deficiency can be subtle. You may have diarrhea, anemia, loss of appetite, and weight loss, as well as weakness, a sore tongue, headaches, heart palpitations, and irritability.If you're only mildly deficient, you may not notice any symptoms at all, but you won't be getting the optimal amount for your baby's early embryonic development.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 1999.

Calcium in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_calcium-in-your-pregnancy-diet_665.bc,"Why you need calcium during pregnancyWhen you're pregnant, your developing baby needs calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Calcium also helps your baby grow a healthy heart, nerves, and muscles as well as develop a normal heart rhythm and blood-clotting abilities.Calcium can also reduce your risk of hypertension and preeclampsia. And if you don't get enough calcium in your diet when you're pregnant, your baby will draw it from your bones, which may impair your own health later on.How much calcium you needWomen ages 19 to 50: 1,000 milligrams (mg) a day before, during, and after pregnancyWomen age 18 and younger: 1,300 mg a day before, during, and after pregnancyMost American women don't get nearly enough of this important mineral. Aim to get 3 cups of dairy products or other calcium-rich foods a day. (See our list of suggestions below.)Even after your baby's born and you're finishedbreastfeeding, continue to pay attention to your calcium intake. You'll need this mineral to strengthen bones and prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) later in life.Food sources of calciumMilk and otherdairy productsare top sources, as are canned fish and calcium-fortified cereal, juice, soy and rice beverages, and bread. Not all brands are fortified, so check labels.1 cup plain low-fat yogurt: 415 mg1.5 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese: 333 mg3 ounces sardines (canned in oil with bone): 325 mg8 ounces low-fat fruit yogurt: 313 to 384 mg8 ounces nonfat milk: 299 mg8 ounces calcium-fortified soy milk: 299 mg8 ounces whole milk: 277 mg6 ounces calcium-fortified orange juice: 261 mg1/2 cup firm, calcium-set tofu: 253 mg3 ounces canned pink salmon, with bones and liquid: 181 mg1 cup cottage cheese (1 percent milk fat): 138 mg1/2 cup vanilla soft-serve frozen yogurt: 103 mg1 cup raw kale, chopped: 100 mg1/2 cup turnip greens, boiled: 99 mg1/2 cup vanilla ice cream: 84 mg1 cup raw bok choy, shredded: 74 mgone slice white bread: 73 mgYou may not think of water as a calcium source, but tap and bottled water typically contain varying amounts, with mineral water containing the most calcium. Check with your local water agency to find out how much calcium is in your local tap or well water.Should you take a supplement?If you're taking aprenatal vitamin, you're probably already getting at least 150 mg of calcium. You could try taking a separate calcium supplement if you aren't getting enough from your diet, but keep in mind that your body can only absorb up to 500 mg of calcium at a time. So you may need to take your supplemental calcium in smaller doses, several times a day.(You need vitamin D to absorb calcium so be sure to also get enough vitamin D in your pregnancy diet.) Supplemental calcium comes in different forms, most commonly calcium carbonate and calcium citrate.Calcium carbonate provides the most calcium, but requires extra stomach acid to help dissolve it, so it's best taken with a meal. Calcium citrate is most easily absorbed by the body. Because this type doesn't require stomach acid for absorption, it can be taken between meals. (It's a good choice for those taking heartburn medication that reduces stomach acid.)Look for a supplement with ""USP"" (for U.S. Pharmacopeia) on the label. This indicates that the supplement contains adequate calcium, will dissolve well, and is free of lead and other toxic metals. Don't take calcium supplements containing bone meal, dolomite, oyster shell, or coral  these may contain a small amount of lead, which can be harmful to your growing baby.And don't overdo it. Make sure your total tally from food, supplements, and water doesn't exceed 2,500 mg (or 3,000 mg if you're younger than 18). Too much calcium can cause constipation, increase your risk of kidney stones, and might hinder your body's absorption of iron and zinc from foods.

How to keep your child healthy this winter,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-keep-your-child-healthy-this-winter_68638.bc,"How can I keep my child from getting sick this winter?Good question, since as sure as the mercury drops, cold and flu viruses make the rounds through homes and schools each year. If only there were a way to guarantee that your child won't get sick. Is there?""Not really,"" says Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Many common winter viruses are airborne, so if your child takes a breath within, say, 4 to 6 feet of someone who's sick, he can easily catch the bug himself.What's more, most people stricken by winter viruses are contagious before they develop symptoms. So pulling your child away from a sniffling, coughing, or sneezing pal doesn't guarantee that he won't come down with similar symptoms himself.Neither will bundling him up: Studies have shown that exposure to cold or damp weather doesn't increase a child's likelihood of catching a cold, says Offit.Still, don't give up without a fight. There are several simple steps you can take to help fend off germs and keep your child as healthy as possible this winter.So what should I do?While it's practically inevitable that your child will get a few colds this winter no matter what you do, it won't hurt to try these germ-fighting strategies:Make sure your child washes his hands.Regular hand washing is the simplest, most effective way to get rid of cold and flu bugs. Teach your child to wash his hands with soap and warm water after he uses the toilet, before meals and snacks, and as soon as he comes home from school, the playground, or a friend's house.You wash up, too, especially before preparing food and after wiping runny noses. No need to pay extra for fancy antibacterial soaps  any soap will remove germs from the skin's surface.Make sure your child's teachers and babysitters are vigilant about hand washing, too. Ask what the official hand-washing policy is at school. If it's less than satisfactory, don't be shy about requesting a change and reminding teachers that this protects their health as well.Teach your child not to touch his eyes or nose.At any given moment, the unwashed human hand is covered with thousands of germs. When a child rubs his eyes or nose, he's depositing those germs directly onto his mucous membranes, where they're rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream.So in addition to having your child wash his hands frequently, remind him not to touch his eyes or rub his nose. Instead, teach him to use a tissue  or at least a clean sleeve  to dab at teary eyes or an itchy nose.While you're at it, teach your child to use tissues when he sneezes or coughs  or to ""catch"" his coughs and sneezes in the crook of his arm. This won't prevent him from getting a virus, but it will help keep him from giving one.Check into the ""sick-kid"" policy at your child's school.Make sure your child's school has a reasonable policy on keeping sick kids away from healthy ones. Most facilities require a child with a fever, the flu, an upper respiratory infection, vomiting, diarrhea, an eye infection, or a rash to stay home until these symptoms subside.If you notice obviously sick kids at your child's school on a regular basis, it's probably time to chat with the teacher or principal about enforcing the rules on sick kids more stringently. (Of course, these kids were contagious before their symptoms showed up, but you still don't want them sneezing or coughing around your child.)Make sure your child's vaccines are up to date.You can help protect your child from some viruses and bacteria simply by making sure his vaccinations are up to date and that he gets a yearly flu shot.Do what you can to boost your child's immunity naturally.Offer your child a variety of healthy foods so he gets the nutrients he needs. Make sure he gets plenty of sleep each night as well as lots of physical activity every day. What to do when your child gets sickSince kids this age average six to eight colds a year, it's a good bet that your child will bring home a few bugs this winter  no matter how hard you try to prevent it. When that happens, the best you can do is make him comfortable until the virus works its way out of his system. A few tips:Teach your child to blow his nose.Encourage your child to blow his nose frequently to get rid of all the extra mucus his body is producing while he has a cold.Make sure your child gets enough rest.While this may be easier said than done, the more rest your child gets, the sooner he'll feel better. So encourage a siesta or two each day.When your child's not resting in bed, set him up on the couch with some quiet activities, like a few new books from the library, a children's video or book on tape, puzzles, drawing or coloring supplies, or board games.Hook up the humidifier.This is especially important at night and during naps, when a persistent cough or difficulty breathing can prevent your child from getting the rest he needs. The moist air from a humidifier or vaporizer will thin your child's mucous secretions, helping to calm his cough and relieve congestion.Urge your child to drink up.Children lose body fluids quickly when they're sick  especially if they're running a fever or have diarrhea. To replenish these fluids, encourage your child to drink plenty of liquids, such as water, juice, an electrolyte solution, or milk. (There's no scientific proof that dairy products make congestion worse.)If your child balks at slugging down a tall drink, try offering extra-juicy fruit (such as watermelon or oranges) or even a frozen juice pop. One old wives' tale that is worth taking to heart: Warm chicken soup helps relieve cold symptoms by soothing a sore throat and thinning nasal secretions.Try vitamin C.Although there's no proof that taking vitamin C can prevent a cold, there is evidence that it helps make cold symptoms less severe and may shorten the duration of a cold.Be careful not to ""mega-dose"" your child  kids should have no more than 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C a day. (A cup of orange juice has about 120 mg, while many chewable vitamin C tablets have 500 mg.)Know when to call the doctor.While most winter viruses clear up on their own within several days, some can turn into more serious conditions that require prompt treatment. Call the doctor if your child has any of these symptoms:Ear or face pain, which can signal an ear infection or sinus infectionA very sore throat combined with a fever (it could be strep throat)Wheezing or trouble breathing (a possible sign of a bronchial infection or pneumonia)Diarrhea or vomiting, which can lead to dangerous dehydrationA fever of 103 degrees or higher, or a milder fever that lasts for more than three daysMake time to snuggle.When kids are feeling under the weather, they need a little extra TLC. So in addition to cooking chicken soup, running for the tissue box, and keeping a constant watch on your child's temperature, make time to simply snuggle with him.Cozy up while you watch a video together, give him plenty of hugs during the day, and if you normally have a ""no kids in the big bed"" rule at night, think about temporarily relaxing the policy. (Of course, you may soon be sniffling yourself, but such is the price of parenthood.)Keep it all in perspective.When you're taking care of a sick, miserable child, try to remember that most winter illnesses pass in a week or so  and all of them will ultimately help strengthen your child's immune system.As your child gets older and builds up immunity to viruses, including many of the 200 that cause the common cold, he'll log fewer and fewer sick days. In the meantime, keep up the hand washing  and stock up on tissues.Show sources Hide sources NIH. Undated. The common cold.

How to get your grade-schooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-grade-schooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_1383895.bc,"Eating well gives your child the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your grade-schooler involvedA great way to get your child excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers and what to pack for his lunchbox.When you take him food shopping, ask him to check items off the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?You can even have your child look for specific ingredients, like sugar, on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Have your child color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage involvement in the kitchenTeach your grade-schooler to follow a simple recipe and measure ingredients. (This is excellent hands-on practice for learning fractions!)Have your child wash the lettuce and toss the salad, grease the baking pans and fill the muffin tins. Let him have some fun pouring pancakes in the shape of his initials or cutting toast into a heart shape.Once he's old enough to handle it, have him grate cheese and even chop fruits and vegetables. (Always supervise your child with knives and electric appliances, of course.) Go to the sourceTake your grade-schooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your child's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your grade-schooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your child won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. Constantly sipping juice can also lead to tooth decay.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day through age 6, and keep it under 8 to 12 ounces per day starting at age 7. Then use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his daily requirement. When he's thirsty, encourage him to drink water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your grade-schooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your grade-schooler's nutritional needs, but remember that eating right isn't all about fruits and vegetables. Calcium is especially important during adolescence, when bones are growing rapidly. Three servings of calcium-rich foods per day are needed. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:A peanut butter sandwich (1 1/2 tablespoons on two slices of whole wheat bread) and one cup of low-fat milk will take care of about a third of your child's recommended daily intake of grain and half of his dairy requirements. It will also provide all of his protein for the day, as well as important nutrients like zinc, vitamin E, magnesium, and essential fatty acids.One and a half cups of bran cereal with raisins with one cup of low-fat milk and a 4-ounce glass of orange juice will satisfy about a third of his fruit, half of his dairy, and a third of his grains for the day. It'll also provide fiber, iron, calcium, and vitamin C.Even a slice of cheese pizza equals almost a third of the day's dairy, providing over half of the day's protein and healthy doses of vitamin A, zinc, and iron.Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger, but choose fruit or low-fat granola instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your grade-schooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2001.

Seven facts about pregnancy after weight-loss surgery,https://www.babycenter.com/0_seven-facts-about-pregnancy-after-weight-loss-surgery_1504874.bc,"Weight-loss surgery (also called bariatric or gastric bypass surgery) is becoming ever more common  according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people getting gastric bypass surgery increased ninefold from 1996 to 2004. But how do these kinds of surgeries affect getting pregnant and pregnancy itself? Here are seven facts you should know about it.1. You may get a boost in fertilityBariatric surgery can produce a sudden positive change in your fertility. A report in a November 2005 issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing found that women with fertility problems linked to obesity who have the surgery can start ovulating regularly for the first time in years.And if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), your fertility should also get a boost after surgery. A study published in the December 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that post-surgery weight loss for women with PCOS resolved their metabolic and reproductive abnormalities.Important caveat: This newfound fertility can raise your chances of getting pregnant by accident if you haven't been using birth control  a problem if you're in the initial 18-month post-surgery period (see below). Read about your birth control options.2. You should wait 18 months before getting pregnantIt's safe to get pregnant after bariatric surgery  after your weight stabilizes. After surgery, your body goes through potentially stressful changes and significant nutritional upheaval, which can pose problems for a growing baby.""Pregnancy after weight-loss surgery isn't an issue. The only concern is [getting pregnant] in the period of rapid weight loss,"" says Philip Schauer, director of advanced laparoscopic and bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic's Bariatric and Metabolic Institute.To protect women and their babies from potential malnutrition, doctors recommend that women not get pregnant until 18 months after surgery. A report in a November 2005 issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing explained that getting pregnant at least 18 months after surgery reduces the ""potential for maternal and fetal malnutrition and small-for-gestational-age infants."" By then, Schauer says, a woman should have reached a stable weight and be able to provide her baby with enough nutrition. 3. You'll need to monitor your nutrient intake closelyEven past the initial post-surgery period, many women have nutritional deficiencies that can be problematic during pregnancy. A study in the April 2006 issue of the American Journal of Medical Science found that the most common nutritional complications associated with bariatric surgery are deficiencies in B12, iron, calcium, and vitamin D. In some cases, post-surgery patients can experience protein-calorie malnutrition and fat malabsorption. After surgery, many women eat as few as 500 calories a day and often have to take extra vitamins to compensate for the ways in which their bodies no longer metabolize nutrients.It may be extra difficult to get the nutrients you need during pregnancy because of nausea  a common post-surgery complication that morning sickness can exacerbate. If nausea has killed your appetite or you can't keep food down, talk to your healthcare provider about antinausea drugs that you can safely take during pregnancy.To make sure you and your baby are getting enough nutrients, see a nutritionist who's knowledgeable about weight-loss surgery. You can find a nutritionist (also called a dietitian) on the American Dietetic Association website  just click on Find a Nutrition Professional. Tell her what kind of surgery you had, how much weight you've gained during pregnancy so far, and your nutritional likes or dislikes. She may recommend that you eat several small meals throughout the day, which improves nutrient absorption.You should also have your provider check your vitamin levels regularly. She may suggest that you take additional vitamin supplements.4. You may need to educate your ob-gynSince the weight-loss surgery boom is relatively recent, many ob-gyns don't know how to treat women who've had it. Moms who have had the surgery say they've been put in the awkward position of educating their obstetricians.""I'm their guinea pig,"" joked Kimberly Jensen, a stay-at-home mom to Ethan in Cheyenne, Wyoming, when she was pregnant after weight-loss surgery. ""They're learning how to treat women who've had weight-loss surgery through me. I'm only their first or second patient who's had the surgery.""If you've had weight-loss surgery and you recently got pregnant or want to get pregnant, start the ball rolling by talking to all your healthcare providers early, recommends Phelan. This will give them a chance to do some research and have the most up-to-date facts at hand when caring for your health. 5. Your risk of complications drops, but doesn't go awayA 2005 study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women who had weight-loss surgery developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes at rates similar to those of healthy-weight women who'd never been obese or had weight-loss surgery.But since many women who get weight-loss surgery are still plus-size to some degree when they become pregnant, moms-to-be can expect their doctors to keep a closer watch on their pregnancies, says Sharon Phelan, an obstetrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who has treated many plus-size women during pregnancy, including women who have had weight-loss surgery.""You're still at risk for gestational diabetes [if you're plus-size but have had weight-loss surgery], but the risk is far less than before surgery,"" says Phelan.For example, Celeste Olivares, a 41-year-old nurse and mother of two, lost more than 150 pounds from gastric banding and was 237 pounds when she became pregnant with her first child in 2005. Her diabetes and cardiomyopathy (a form of heart inflammation) had gone away completely after the weight loss, but she continued to monitor her blood sugar during pregnancy. At 30 weeks, her blood sugar rose slightly and her doctor put her on insulin as a protective measure.6. You may face a body-image battleOne of the biggest emotional effects of pregnancy for post-surgery women, says Phelan, arises from body image. Not only does a woman have to get used to the idea that her belly will grow again, but she may also have some scars from the surgery that don't stretch very well as she grows.""Psychologically, a lot of women who've had surgery to lose weight have a very hard time accepting that they have to gain weight,"" says Phelan. ""They have to get comfortable with the fact that 'Yes, now is the time to gain weight.' Another emotional part of pregnancy is that it's stressful and people tend to eat when they're stressed.""So women run the risk of going to extremes  either dieting while pregnant, which can have serious nutritional consequences for the baby, or gaining back some of the weight they lost because they're eating more food. There's also the problem of food pushers, Phelan notes. These are the people who, seeing you're pregnant, say, ""Go ahead, have another slice of cake!""Kimberly Jensen says she did worry about gaining weight during her pregnancy. ""Everyone told me not to worry about weight gain,"" she says. ""But that was my biggest fear, gaining weight. It's tricky because you can be dieting even though you don't think you're dieting. The key is to think about the baby before you eat, so you're thinking about what's best for him.""7. You're more likely to have a cesareanPregnant women who've had bariatric surgery are more likely to end up with a c-section, according to a 2004 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It's not clear exactly why this is the case and what factors are involved, but it helps to talk to your healthcare provider.Does your provider consider you at high risk for a c-section, and if so, why? Ask about your provider's c-section rate and philosophy about c-sections in general. If you have no serious health problems, is the provider fine with trying vaginal delivery? During a vaginal delivery, what might cause your provider to order a c-section intervention?Also, you may be able reduce your odds of having a c-section by following your doctor's weight-gain recommendations, exercising during pregnancy, and taking childbirth preparation classes.Learn more about c-sections and what the recovery is like."
How to keep your preschooler healthy this winter,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-keep-your-preschooler-healthy-this-winter_66483.bc,"How can I keep my preschooler from getting sick this winter?Good question, since as sure as the mercury drops, cold and fluviruses make the rounds through homes, daycare centers, and schools each year. If only there were a way to guarantee that your child won't get sick. Is there?""Not really,"" says Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Many common winter viruses are airborne, so if your child takes a breath within, say, 4 to 6 feet of someone who's sick, he can easily catch the bug himself.What's more, most people stricken by winter viruses are contagious before they develop symptoms. So pulling your child away from a sniffling, coughing, or sneezing pal doesn't guarantee that he won't come down with similar symptoms himself.Neither will bundling him up: Studies have shown that exposure to cold or damp weather doesn't increase a child's likelihood of catching a cold, says Offit.Still, don't give up without a fight. There are several simple steps you can take to help fend off germs and keep your preschooler as healthy as possible this winter.So what should I do?While it's practically inevitable that your child will get a few colds this winter no matter what you do, it won't hurt to try these germ-fighting strategies:Make sure your child washes his hands.Regular hand washing is the simplest, most effective way to get rid of cold and flu bugs. Teach your child to wash his hands with soap and warm water after he uses the toilet, before meals and snacks, and as soon as he comes home from daycare, preschool, the playground, or a friend's house.You wash up, too, especially before preparing food and after wiping runny noses. No need to pay extra for fancy antibacterial soaps  any soap will remove germs from the skin's surface.If your child's in daycare or preschool, make sure his caregivers are vigilant about hand washing, too. Ask what the official hand-washing policy is. If it's less than satisfactory, don't be shy about requesting a change and reminding caregivers that this protects their health as well.Teach your child not to touch his eyes or nose.At any given moment, the unwashed human hand is covered with thousands of germs. When a child rubs his eyes or nose, he's depositing those germs directly onto his mucous membranes, where they're rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream.So in addition to having your child wash his hands frequently, remind him not to touch his eyes or rub his nose. Instead, teach him to use a tissue  or at least a clean sleeve  to dab at teary eyes or an itchy nose.While you're at it, teach your child to use tissues when he sneezes or coughs  or to ""catch"" his coughs and sneezes in the crook of his arm. This won't prevent him from getting a virus, but it will help keep him from giving one. Of course, he's only a preschooler, so this process could take a while.Teach your child to blow his nose.Learning to blow his nose may take some practice, but once your child knows how, he can help his body get rid of all the extra mucus it's producing while he has a cold.If your child's in daycare or preschool, check into the ""sick-kid"" policy.Make sure your child's daycare center or preschool has a reasonable policy on keeping sick kids away from healthy ones. Many facilities require a child with a fever, the flu, vomiting, diarrhea, or an eye infection to stay home until these symptoms subside.If you notice obviously sick kids at your child's daycare or preschool on a regular basis, it's probably time to chat with the caregiver or director about enforcing the rules on sick kids more stringently. (Of course, these kids were contagious before their symptoms showed up, but you still don't want them sneezing or coughing around your child.)Make sure your child's vaccines are up to date.You can help protect your preschooler from some viruses and bacteria simply by making sure his vaccinations are up to date and that he gets a yearly flu shot.Do what you can to boost your child's immunity naturally.Offer your child a variety of healthy foods so he gets the nutrients he needs. Make sure he gets plenty of sleep each night as well as lots of physical activity every day. What to do when your child gets sickSince children average eight to ten colds a year, it's a good bet that your child will bring home a few bugs this winter  no matter how hard you try to prevent it. When that happens, the best you can do is make him comfortable until the virus works its way out of his system. A few tips:Try saline nose drops.You might get some complaints about this one, but saline drops help to thin and clear nasal mucus and relieve congestion.Offit recommends using a bulb syringe for best results: If your child will let you, tilt his head back slightly, then gently squeeze the bulb to deposit the saline drops in his nose. Next, use the bulb to remove the mucus. Repeat this process several times a day.Make sure your child gets enough rest.While this may be easier said than done, the more rest your child gets, the sooner he'll feel better. Even if he no longer naps, encourage a siesta or two each day.When your child's not resting in bed, set him up on the couch with a children's video or book on tape. Encourage him to do quiet activities, such as drawing, puzzles, or playing with Play-DohHook up the humidifier.This is especially important at night and during naps, when a persistent cough or difficulty breathing can prevent your child from getting the rest he needs. The moist air from a humidifier or vaporizer will thin your child's mucous secretions, helping to calm his cough and relieve congestion.Urge your child to drink up.Children lose body fluids quickly when they're sick  especially if they're running a fever or have diarrhea. To replenish these fluids, encourage your child to drink plenty of liquids, such as water, juice, an electrolyte solution, or milk. (There's no scientific proof that dairy products make congestion worse.)If your child balks at slugging down a tall drink, try offering extra-juicy fruit (such as watermelon or oranges) or even a frozen juice pop. One old wives' tale that is worth taking to heart: Warm chicken soup helps relieve cold symptoms by soothing a sore throat and thinning nasal secretions.Try vitamin C.Although there's no proof that taking vitamin C can prevent a cold, there is evidence that it helps make cold symptoms less severe and may shorten the duration of a cold.Be careful not to ""mega-dose"" your child  kids should have no more than 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C a day. (A cup of orange juice has about 120 mg, while many chewable vitamin C tablets have 500 mg.)Know when to call the doctor.While most winter viruses clear up on their own within several days, some can turn into more serious conditions that require prompt treatment. Call the doctor if your child has any of these symptoms:Ear or face pain, which can signal an ear infection or sinus infectionA very sore throat combined with a fever (it could be strep throat)Wheezing or trouble breathing (a possible sign of a bronchial infection or pneumonia)Diarrhea or vomiting, which can lead to dangerous dehydrationA fever of 103 degrees or higher, or a milder fever that lasts for more than three daysMake time to snuggle.When kids are feeling under the weather, they need a little extra TLC. So in addition to cooking chicken soup, running for the tissue box, and keeping a constant watch on your child's temperature, make time to simply snuggle with him.Let him climb onto your lap while you read a book together, give him plenty of hugs during the day, and if you normally have a ""no kids in the big bed"" rule at night, think about temporarily relaxing the policy. (Of course, you may soon be sniffling yourself, but such is the price of parenthood.)Keep it all in perspective.When you're taking care of a sick, miserable preschooler, try to remember that most winter illnesses pass in a week or so  and all of them will ultimately help strengthen your child's immune system.As your child gets older and builds up immunity to viruses, including many of the 200 that cause the common cold, he'll log fewer and fewer sick days.

"A healthy pregnancy diet, Latino style: Portion sizes for common foods",https://www.babycenter.com/0_a-healthy-pregnancy-diet-latino-style-portion-sizes-for-comm_10302511.bc,"Food listTake a look at this list to get an idea of the wide variety of foods you can choose from to make up your healthy pregnancy diet. Next to each food item, you'll find the quantity that makes one portion. For instance, ""Arepa: 1/2"" means that half an arepa is equal to one serving of carbohydrates.This will make it easier to follow our healthy pregnancy eating plan. Included are many delicious Latino ingredients that you can enjoy while pregnant. CarbohydratesThe average woman needs nine daily servings of carbohydrates (which are also referred to as starches).Legumes, grains, cereals, starchy vegetables, fruit, and milk all contain about the same amount of carbohydrate per serving. (Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, contain fewer carbohydrates.) The key to controlling blood sugar is to balance the number of carbohydrate choices at each meal and snack.This is particularly important for Latino women. Certain ethnic groups that have a high rate of diabetes, including Hispanics, are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.It's best to vary your carbohydrate choices as much as possible, selecting from all of the different categories. Each day, for example, aim for a serving or two of legumes, some grains, some cereals, three servings of milk, some fruit, and a couple of servings of starchy vegetables, in addition to three cups of nonstarchy vegetables. .Choose whole grains over refined products whenever you can. In fact, at least half of the grains you eat should be whole grains.Whole wheat breads and corn tortillas, for example, are better options than varieties made from white flour. Unrefined grains like brown rice contain more vitamins and fiber than those that are refined, and they don't make your blood sugar rise as rapidly. Breads and tortillas1 serving equals:Arepa (without cheese): 1/2Bagel, small: 1/2Bagel, large: 1/4Bread (white, whole wheat, pumpernickel): 1 sliceBun for hot dog or hamburger: 1/2Corn bread, 2 inch square: 1 (+ 1 serving of fat)Corn tortilla (yellow, blue, or black corn), 6 inches across: 1Croutons: 1/2 cup (+ 1 fat)English muffin: 1/2Flour tortilla (white or whole wheat), 6 inches across: 1Gordita, unfilled: 1/2Jalapeo bread: 1 small slice (+ 2 fats)Pancake, 4 inches across: 1 (+ 1 fat)Pupusa, no filling: 1/2 (+ 1 fat)Sweet bread (media noche): 1/2 sliceTaco shell, 5 inches across: 2 (+1 fat)Crackers1 serving equals:Animal crackers: 8Crackers filled with cheese or peanut butter: 3 (+ 1 fat)Graham crackers, 2 1/2 inch square: 3Melba toast crackers: 4Round appetizer crackers: 6 (+ 1 fat)Saltines: 6Whole wheat crackers: 5 (+ 1 fat) Snacks1 serving equals:Tortilla or potato chips (low-fat or baked): 15 to 20 (3/4 ounce)Fig bars: 2French fries: 10 to 15 (+ 1 fat)Plantain chips: 12 (+ 2 fats)Popcorn (light or no fat added): 3 cupsPretzels: 3/4 ounceRefried flour chicharrn (chicharrn de harina enchilado): 1 ounce (+ 1 fat)Rice cakes, 4 inches: 2Cereals and grains1 serving equals:Cereal bar: 1 (+ 1 fat)Low-sugar cereal like O-shaped cereal, wheat, oat, or corn flakes: 3/4 cupBran flakes: 1/2 cupPuffed rice or wheat cereal: 1 1/2 cupsFlour for cooking: 3 tablespoonsGranola (low fat): 1/4 cupMuesli: 1/4 cupOatmeal or grits, unsweetened: 1/2 cupPasta: 1/3 cupPolenta, cooked without fat: 1/3 cupRice (white or brown): 1/3 cup cookedWild rice: 1/2 cup cooked LegumesNote that legumes count as both a protein (lean or medium-fat meat) and a carbohydrate (starch) serving.1 serving equals:Beans (black, garbanzo, kidney, navy, pinto, refried beans): 1/2 cup (+ 1 lean meat)Edamame: 1/2 cup (+ 1 lean meat)Hummus: 1/3 cup (+ 1 medium-fat meat)Lentils: 1/2 cup (+ 1 lean meat)Peas (black-eyed, split, green): 1/2 cup (+ 1 lean meat)Gandules (pigeon peas): 1/2 cup (+ 1 lean meat)Starchy vegetablesThese are a good source of vitamin A. (Eat at least twice a week.)1 serving equals:Pumpkin, canned: 1 cupSweet potato: 1/2 cupOther starchy vegetables1 serving equals:Acorn or butternut squash: 1 cupCorn: 1/2 cup or 1/2 large earMashed potato: 1/2 cupMixed vegetables (corn, peas, and other vegetables): 1 cupPlantain, ripe: 1/3 cupPotato (boiled or roasted): 1 smallYucca: 1/3 cup VegetablesThe average pregnant woman needs 3 cups of vegetables daily. A good goal is to eat at least one serving of raw vegetables every day.In general, a 1-cup portion of vegetables is equivalent to 1 cup of vegetable juice, 1 cup of cooked vegetables, or 2 cups of leafy greens. These nonstarchy vegetables contain very few carbohydrates.Vegetables that are high in vitamins A and C are orange, red, yellow, or dark green. Vitamins A and C are important for a healthy pregnancy, so it's recommended that you eat these colorful vegetables every day.Good vegetable sources of vitamin A(Choose at least one a day.)Carrots and carrot juiceChinese cabbageKaleMixed vegetablesRed peppersSalsaSpinachGood vegetable sources of vitamin C(Choose at least one a day.)BroccoliBrussels sproutsCauliflowerChilesGreen tomatoKalePeppers, red and greenCabbage, red Other vegetablesAlfalfa sproutsArtichokesAsparagusBeetsCabbageChayoteCucumberEggplantHearts of palmJcamaLettuce (all types)Maguey or yucca flowersNopalitosMushroomsOkraOnionPumpkin flowersSquash (yellow, green, and calabacitas)Tomato, jitomate, jitomatilloTurnipVerdolagaWatercress FruitThe average pregnant woman should eat four servings of fruit per day. This is about 2 cups of fresh fruit.One serving of fruit equals one small to medium piece of fresh fruit, 1/2 cup of canned fruit or fruit juice, or 2 tablespoons of dried fruit. As with vegetables, look for fruit that is high in vitamins A and C.Good fruit sources of vitamin A or C(Choose at least one each day.)One serving equals:Apricots, dried: 8 halvesApricots, fresh: 4Cantaloupe: 1 cup, cubedGrapefruit: 1/2Guava: 1/2 cupKiwi: 1Mandarin/tangerine: 2 smallMaracuy (passion fruit): 2 ouncesMango: 1/2Nectarine, small: 1Orange, small: 1Orange or grapefruit juice: 1/2 cupPapaya: 1 cup, cubedPassion fruit: 1/4 cupPeach: 1 mediumPineapple: 3/4 cupStrawberries: 1 1/4 cup Other fruitApple juice: 1/2 cupBanana: 1 extra small or 1/2 extra largeBerries (blue or black): 3/4 cupCherimoya fruit: 1/2 cup dicedCherries: 12Dates: 3Figs, fresh: 2Figs, dried: 1 1/2Grape juice: 1/3 cupMamey: 1/7Plums: 2 smallPrunes: 3Raspberries: 1 cupRaisins: 2 tablespoonsTamarind pulp: 1/5 cupTecojote (crabapple): 3/4 cupWatermelon: 1 slice or 1 1/4 cupXoconostle (prickly pear): 1 Milk and yogurtPregnant women need three daily servings from the milk/yogurt category of carbohydrates. Milk and yogurt are great sources of calcium. (Cheese is too, but for the purpose of meal planning, it is counted as protein.)1 serving equals:Evaporated skim milk: 1/2 cupNonfat plain yogurt: 6 oz (2/3 cup)Powdered nonfat milk: 1/3 cupNonfat milk or 1% milk: 1 cupKefir, low-fat jocoque: 1 cup (+ 1 fat)2% reduced-fat milk: 1 cup (+ 1 fat)Reduced-fat soy milk: 1 cup (+ 1 fat)Whole milk or soy milk: 1 cup (+ 1.5 fat)ProteinThe average woman who drinks three servings of milk needs about 7 ounces of meat/meat substitutes per day. It's best to have the protein divided between meals and snacks.Legumes also provide an excellent source of protein. They are listed in the Starch section above.In the following lists, foods that aren't measured in ounces have one-ounce equivalents noted. Some sources of protein (like the high-fat meats and meat substitutes listed below) contain a lot of fat, so it's better not to eat them more than once or twice a week.Lean meat and meat substitutesBeef (select or choice, round, roast, sirloin, tenderloin)Egg whites: 2Egg substitute: 1/4 cupLamb (roast, chop, leg)MenudoPork (Canadian bacon, ham, tenderloin)Poultry without the skin (chicken, Cornish hen, duck, turkey)Shrimp, shellfish, sardines, tunaWhite fish (tilapia, sole, hake)Wild game Medium-fat meat and meat substitutesBeef (corned, ground, prime rib, short ribs, tongue)Cheese with 4 to 7 grams of fat per ounce (see list below)Eggs: 1Fried fishPoultry (chicken with skin, ground turkey, fried chicken)SalmonHigh-fat meats and meat substitutesBaconBologna with 8 or more grams of fat per ounceCarnitasHigher-fat cheese (see list below)Hot dogsLunch meat with 8 or more grams of fatMachacaPork (ground, sausage, spareribs)Sausage with 8 or more grams of fat (bratwurst, chorizo, Italian, Polish, smoked, summer)Plant-based meat substitutesLegumes are a popular lean-meat substitute and are listed under Starches. Again, amounts given below are equivalent to one ounce of lean or medium-fat meat:Peanut butter: 1 tablespoon (1 high-fat meat)Soy-based chicken nuggets: 1 1/2 ounce or 2 nuggets (1/2 carbohydrate + 1 medium-fat meat)Soy-based hot dog: 1 1/2 ounce (1/2 carbohydrate + 1 lean meat)Soy burger: 3 ounce (1/2 carbohydrate + 2 lean meats)Tofu, light: 1/2 cup or 4 ounces (1 lean meat)Tofu, regular: 1/2 cup or 4 ounces (1 medium-fat meat) CheeseCheese, a big part of the Latino diet, provides a rich source of calcium and is also considered a meat/meat substitute. However, some cheeses have a lot of fat and calories, so be careful with your choices.And you should avoid certain soft cheeses during pregnancy. (See those italicized, below.) To be safe, don't eat any cheese made from raw milk. Make sure that the label on the cheese says it's made from pasteurized milk.Less-fatty cheese (contains up to 7 grams of fat per ounce)1 serving equals:Asadero: 1 ounceCottage cheese: 1/4 cupFeta: 1 ounceMozzarella, part skim or regular: 1 ounceParmesan, grated: 2 tablespoonsQueso blanco (white Mexican cheese): 1 ounceQueso fresco (fresh Mexican cheese): 1 ounceHigher-fat cheese (contains 8 or more grams of fat per ounce)1 serving equals:American: 1 ounceBlue cheese: 1 ounceBrie, Camembert: 1 ounceCheddar: 1 ounceChihuahua: 1 ounceCotija: 2 tablespoonsMonterey Jack, with or without jalapeo pepper: 1 ounceMuenster: 1 ounceProvolone: 1 ounceSwiss, Gruyre: 1 ounce FatsAim for about six servings (1 teaspoon each) of fat per day while you're pregnant.Keep in mind that much of the fat in your diet is already in the foods you eat. Added fats (like mayonnaise on your sandwich or dressing on your salad) and those used in cooking (like lard and oil) can add hefty amounts to the total fat and calories in your diet. So limit your fat intake, but don't eliminate fats altogether  they're necessary for a healthy pregnancy.Cooking with vegetable oils such as olive oil instead of animal fats such as lard and butter is better for your cholesterol count as well as your overall health and your baby's. Choose mostly from the monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats listed below.Each serving of fat below is equal to 1 teaspoon of fat.Monounsaturated fats1 serving equals:Almonds, cashews: 6Avocado: 2 tablespoonsHazelnuts: 6Nut butters, trans-fat-free: 1 1/2 tablespoonOil (canola, olive, peanut): 1 teaspoonOlives, black: 8 largeOlives, green with pimiento: 10Peanuts: 10Pecans: 4 halvesPistachios: 16 Polyunsaturated fats1 serving equals:Margarine (trans-fat-free stick, tub, or squeeze): 1 teaspoonMargarine, low-fat spread: 1 tablespoonMayonnaise, regular: 1 teaspoonMayonnaise, reduced-fat: 1 tablespoonOil (corn, cottonseed, flaxseed, grapeseed, safflower, soybean, sunflower): 1 teaspoonPine nuts: 1 tablespoonRanch dressing, regular: 1/2 tablespoonRanch dressing, low-fat: 2 tablespoonsSeeds (flaxseed, pumpkin, sesame, sunflower): 1 tablespoonTahini (sesame paste): 2 teaspoonsWalnuts: 4 halvesSaturated fats1 serving equals:Alfredo sauce: 2 tablespoonsBacon: 1 sliceButter, stick: 1 teaspoonButter, whipped: 2 teaspoonsCaesar salad dressing: 2 teaspoonsCoconut, shredded: 2 tablespoonsCream, heavy: 1 tablespoonCream, whipped: 2 tablespoonsCream cheese, regular: 1 tablespoonCream cheese, reduced fat: 1 1/2 tablespoonsHalf and half: 2 tablespoonsLard: 1 teaspoonSour cream, regular: 2 tablespoonsSour cream, reduced-fat: 3 tablespoons Sweets, desserts, and other carbohydratesIf you're at risk for gestational diabetes or have diabetes already, you should eat sweets only occasionally during pregnancy.Because these foods contain extra sugar, they're counted as one or more carbohydrate choices, as noted. These refined carbohydrates can quickly raise blood sugar, so make sure to eat them sparingly and as part of a meal. Most also contain extra fat, as noted.The foods below represent what a ""moderate"" serving size of a sweet or dessert would be and how they count in the starch and fat categories.Frozen and milk-based desserts/beveragesFrozen yogurt, fat-free: 1/3 cup (1 carbohydrate)Frozen yogurt, regular: 1/2 cup (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Ice cream, light or no sugar added: 1/2 cup (1 carbohydrate+ 1 fat)Sherbet, sorbet: 1/2 cup (2 carbohydrates)Pudding, regular: 1/2 cup (2 carbohydrates)Pudding, sugar free: 1/2 cup (1 carbohydrate)Hot chocolate, instant regular made with water: 1 cup (1 carbohydrate)Hot chocolate, instant sugar-free made with water: 1 cup (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Other dessertsAngel food cake, unfrosted: 1/12 of cake (2 carbohydrates)Brownie: 1 ounce (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Cake, unfrosted: 2 square inches (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Chocolate-chip cookie, 2 1/4 inches across: 2 (1 carbohydrate+ 2 fats)Chocolate kisses: 5 pieces (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Buuelo: 1 medium (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Churro: 1 medium (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Empanada: 1 (1 1/2 carbohydrates + 1 fat)Fruit pie with 2 crusts: 1/6 of pie (3 carbohydrates + 2 fats)Glazed donut: 1 (2 carbohydrates + 2 fats)Muffin, large: 1/4 (1 carbohydrate + 1/2 fat)Peanut palanqueta: 1/2 piece (1 carbohydrate + 1 fat)Pumpkin pie: 1/8 of 8-inch pie (1 1/2 carbohydrates plus 1/2 fat)Syrups and spreadsChocolate syrup: 1 tablespoon (1 carbohydrate)Fruit spread (100% fruit): 1 1/2 tablespoons (1 carbohydrate)Honey: 1 tablespoon (1 carbohydrate)Pancake syrup, light: 2 tablespoons (1 carbohydrate)By Lourdes Alcaiz, author of Waiting for Beb: A Pregnancy Guide for Latinas"
Healthy food swaps,https://www.babycenter.com/0_healthy-food-swaps_10381493.bc,"You know your family should be eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes  they're nutrient-rich, heart-healthy, planet-friendly foods.But it's not always easy, especially when you're feeding picky eaters. Try these stealthy switch-ups and fun presentations to deliver more nutrition without alerting the finicky folks in your family grown-ups too!Blend in veggiesUsing a hand blender or food processor, puree a mix of vegetables and stir it into tomato-based dishes like pasta sauce or chili. This is an easy way to add vitamins, nutrients, and fiber while avoiding recognizable chunks of vegetables your child might otherwise reject. You can use this trick with soups and casseroles too.Choose whole grain tortillasA lot of people don't like whole-grain bread and pasta if they're used to white-flour versions. It can take time for your palate to adjust, like changing from whole milk to low-fat or skim. But whole grains have a delicious, nutty flavor that you may come to prefer  and so might your child, given enough exposure.Tortillas can be a good place to start. Burritos, enchiladas, or tacos  especially when smothered in a zesty tomato sauce  are a great way to sneak in some whole grains. Thanks to bold flavors, your child probably won't notice that healthy wrapper.Pick fruit instead of fruit juiceKids love fruit juices, but most drink too much. It's better to eat whole fruit, which has more fiber and fewer calories. If you do give your child juice, make sure it's 100 percent juice to avoid added sugar, and try diluting it so it's at least half water.Also, keep in mind the American Academy of Pediatrics' advice when it comes to juice: No juice for babies younger than 6 months, limit daily servings of juice to 4 to 6 ounces for children 6 and younger, and no more than 8 to 12 ounces for kids 7 and older.Vary your proteins with tofuIt's smart to consume a variety of proteins, and tofu is a great source that doesn't call attention to itself when mixed with other ingredients. Try adding chopped tofu to a bean-and-corn burrito, for example. (""This chicken is delicious!"" said one of my unwitting friends when served refried-bean-and-tofu enchiladas one evening.)Tofu also works great chopped up and scrambled like eggs in a breakfast burrito or mixed in with sliced vegetables for a quick stir-fry. Use silken tofu in fruit smoothies for a healthy treat.Make things tastier with nut buttersNuts are nutrient powerhouses, rich in heart-healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. The tried-and-true trick of slathering peanut butter onto celery sticks or apples is a winner (as long as your child doesn't have a nut allergy, of course).Adding raisins or dried cranberries is a yummy way to increase fruit consumption  though you'll want to watch the portions, as dried fruits and nut butters are energy dense. Peanut butter is classic, but there are lots of other nut butters to try. Diversity is key to a healthy diet.Add veggies to tuna saladAdding finely diced carrots, celery, onions, peppers, and even radishes to tuna sandwiches is a good way to tuck in extra veggies. It might take some trial and error to see what your child will accept, but you'll probably be able to include at least a few of these vegetables with success.How about adding a drizzle of olive oil too? He won't taste it next to the mayo, but olive oil will add valuable phytonutrients and monounsaturated fat for a heart-healthier sandwich filling.Try whole grain pastaSame approach here as with tortillas  the whole-grain version is healthier and can be easier to introduce when served with a hearty sauce. Start with a little whole-grain pasta mixed in with your regular brand to help your child adjust to the taste, and in a couple of months you can make the full swap. You can try the same thing when switching from white to brown rice.Substitute white whole-wheat flourWhite whole-wheat flour is one of the best things to hit the market in recent years. It doesn't work for all baked goods, but you can use it in many items (or use half white flour and half white whole-wheat flour) and no one will be able to tell. You can make healthier chocolate chip cookies and brownies, but these are still once-in-a-while treats, not health foods.Learn more:Find ideas for quick and healthy snacksSeven strategies for feeding a picky eaterCooking with kidsP.

Postpartum fatigue: How to cope,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-fatigue-how-to-cope_1152217.bc,"It's been several weeks since I had my baby, and I'm still tired all the time. Will I ever feel rested again?Feeling tired  or just plain wiped out  is one of new moms' most common complaints. After all, your body is recuperating from the incredible physical challenge of pregnancy and childbirth (and, if you had a c-section, major abdominal surgery). At the same time, you're caring for a newborn who needs food, diaper changes, and hands-on attention around the clock, so what sleep you do get is likely to be less restorative because it's so fragmented.Unfortunately, the fatigue can last for months, depending on a host of factors, including how well your baby sleeps (and how adept you are at adjusting your schedule to his), the amount of support you have at home, and possibly added demands of work outside the home.Could there be other reasons for my fatigue?Maybe. There's an association between extreme fatigue and postpartum depression, though it's often not clear what's causing what. (Chronic sleep deprivation may contribute to your feeling depressed, and feeling depressed can make sleeping more difficult.)In any case, if you find that you can't sleep, have lost interest in doing anything, and feel despairing, you could be suffering from postpartum depression. Call your healthcare practitioner for a referral to a therapist.Anemia may also cause  or add to  your fatigue. If you were anemic during pregnancy or lost a lot of blood at delivery, your practitioner may advise to you to take iron supplements in addition to prenatal vitamins.Postpartum fatigue can sometimes be a symptom of an underactive thyroid gland, also known as hypothyroidism. A small percentage of women develop this condition four to eight months after giving birth. Talk to your ob-gyn or midwife if your fatigue gets worse around this time. Hypothyroidism is treatable. What can I do to cope with fatigue?Keep in mind that your priority right now is saving energy for yourself, your baby, and your other children, if you have any. That may mean relaxing your usual standards a little (or a lot) when it comes to housecleaning. Or it may mean that you take your spouse out to dinner this year for his birthday instead of throwing a party.You're likely to get your energy back faster in the long run if you conserve it now.Here are some specific coping strategies:Get all the rest you can. Sleep when your baby sleeps. Try to go to bed at night soon after he settles in, and during the day, nap when he does. If you find napping impossible, at least put your feet up and close your eyes. If you're breastfeeding, try nursing lying on your side, so you can really relax during some of his feedings.Take any opportunity you can to rest, even when you have visitors. Your family and friends will understand (if they don't, explain it to them) and can entertain themselves.Drink plenty of fluids, try to make healthy food choices, and don't skip meals. Now is not the time to crash diet. Food is your fuel.Though you may feel an immediate pickup from caffeine and sweets, don't rely on them. In the long run you're better off without the quick boost. Instead, go for the long haul with foods that will help provide sustained energy, like those high in complex carbohydrates and protein.You may want to continue taking prenatal vitamins, too, especially if you're breastfeeding.Take your baby out for a walk. Start by walking slowly and going only a short distance. As you regain your strength, gradually step up your pace and the length of your walk. Exercise can give you a boost of energy, and the fresh air and movement may help you both sleep better at night.Call on friends and family for help. Who can do chores, cook meals, help with your other children, or run errands? Who would enjoy caring for the baby while you lie down for a bit? Identify those people and ask them to do specific things. Most people appreciate the opportunity to help.Choose your houseguests wisely. If you get along well with your mother or mother-in-law and she loves cooking and cleaning, by all means invite her over. But if she'll be more of a burden than a help, it's best to delay an extended visit. And remember that it's perfectly fine to tell even the best of friends that you're just too tired for visitors today.Consider hiring a postpartum doula if you don't have a good support network and it won't put too much of a strain on your finances. These women are experienced in mother and newborn care and will come to your home to help with housework, cooking, and childcare, offer breastfeeding support, or run errands.If you work outside the home but don't feel ready to jump back in and can afford to wait, check out ways to extend your maternity leave."
Is preeclampsia preventable?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_is-preeclampsia-preventable_10415691.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineNo one knows for sure whether preeclampsia can be prevented since the cause of the condition is unknown. It's likely that different factors are involved. Although it's hard to give clear advice about how to prevent preeclampsia, you can take steps to lower your risk.Most experts believe that preeclampsia happens when the placenta isn't working as well as it should. The placenta connects the baby to the uterus by the umbilical cord. It supplies a baby with oxygen and nutrients, and removes waste.About 5 percent of pregnant women develop preeclampsia, but some women have a higher risk than others. At your first prenatal appointment, your provider will take a detailed medical history to evaluate your risk.What are the risk factors for preeclampsia?The risk factors for preeclampsia include:Being obese (having a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher) at the start of your pregnancyHaving a family or personal history of preeclampsiaExpecting twins or moreBeing age 35 or olderHaving in vitro fertilization (IVF)Having an autoimmune condition, such as lupusHaving another chronic condition, such as high blood pressure before pregnancy (chronic hypertension), kidney disease, or diabetes (type 1 or 2)Having the blood-clotting disorder thrombophiliaExpecting your first babyIf you have any of these risk factors, talk to your healthcare provider. There may be ways to lower your chance of developing preeclampsia, either before you become pregnant or during pregnancy.What can I do before pregnancy to lower the risk of preeclampsia?Some risk factors  like your age or the number of babies you're carrying  are out of your control. But you can change other risk factors. If you're overweight, for example, losing weight before you get pregnant may reduce your risk of getting preeclampsia.Getting pre-existing medical conditions under good control now also helps reduce your risk of complications during pregnancy so you and your baby stay healthy. If you have a long-term medical condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, schedule a preconception checkup with your provider. Because preeclampsia involves an increase in blood pressure, women who already have high blood pressure are at greater risk of developing the condition. If you have diabetes, it's important that your blood sugar levels are well controlled before you become pregnant.Your options for making lifestyle changes and taking medication are often limited once you're pregnant, so use the time before pregnancy to do everything you can to maximize your health.What can I do during pregnancy to lower the risk of preeclampsia?Once you're pregnant, be sure to attend all your prenatal appointments. At each visit, your provider takes your blood pressure and may check your urine for protein, which can be a sign of preeclampsia. If you have an especially high risk of developing preeclampsia, your provider may recommend that you take a low dose (81 milligrams) of aspirin daily during pregnancy.Research shows that starting low-dose aspirin at the end of your first trimester can reduce your chance of developing preeclampsia if you're at increased risk. (Don't take any drug when you're pregnant without checking with your provider first.)In the event that you develop the condition, you can start treatment immediately.What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?It's also important to know the symptoms of preeclampsia, so you can watch for them between appointments. Call your provider right away if you have:Swelling of your hands or faceSudden weight gainVision problems, such as blurring and seeing spots or flashesSevere pain below your ribsDifficulty breathingA severe headache that won't go awayNausea and vomitingDo supplements help prevent preeclampsia?There's little to no evidence that supplements can prevent preeclampsia, even though you may find lists of recommendations when searching online for ways to avoid the condition.Some research shows calcium could help prevent preeclampsia in women who don't get enough of the mineral. But most Americans already get the recommended amount of 1,000 milligrams daily from their diet, so the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't recommend extra calcium for healthy women in the United States.Some women have also tried taking Vitamin C, E, or fish oils to prevent preeclampsia, but again, there's no evidence that these supplements have a beneficial effect. Unless your provider specifically advises otherwise, a regular prenatal vitamin containing folic acid is all you need.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information about preeclampsia and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Choosing to formula-feed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-to-formula-feed_471.bc,"I want to formula-feed my baby, but everybody says it's better to breastfeed. Is this true?Both formula feeding and breastfeeding are valid, healthy choices for your baby. The decision to do one or the other  or a combination of both  is purely personal and depends on what's right for your family and circumstances.Breast milk gives your baby the best possible nutrition, protects against infection, and even adjusts to meet your infant's nutritional needs (something formula can't do). You benefit too: Breastfeeding helps you bond with your baby, and research suggests it may even lower your risk of ovarian and breast cancers.If possible, you may want to try nursing, at least for the first month, so your natural immunities can be passed to your child.Or, consider a combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding. If you're nursing, it's okay to give your baby formula once a day as long as your breast milk supply is well established, which usually happens within a month of giving birth. Some women supplement this way because formula feeding gives them a break (especially in the middle of the night) and lets their partner help feed the baby.That said, exclusive formula feeding  either right from the start or after a period of nursing  is also a healthy way to feed your baby. Formula even has some vitamins and other nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.If you're concerned about your choice, try to separate the medical facts from the political and cultural rhetoric. Your child's doctor will work with you to make sure your baby is getting all the nutrients she needs and chart her growth to make sure she's growing well. In the end, the most important thing you can do for your baby is love and nurture her  and that includes feeding her whichever way you choose.There are plenty of reasons women choose to formula-feed. Among them are having a baby with a poor sucking reflex (common in premature babies), prolonged mother-infant separation, painful nursing, the fear that your baby isn't getting enough milk, the need to return to work, a health problem that requires medication that's not safe for a nursing infant, and a desire to let other family members help feed the baby.Which type of formula should I use?Most formulas are made from cow's milk or soybeans. There are also specialized formulas for babies who are allergic to milk or soy proteins, and for babies who are premature or have a low birth weight. Any formula you choose should be iron-fortified to prevent anemia. To find out more about choosing the right formula for your baby, see our article and talk to your baby's doctor.Why can't I just feed my baby cow's milk?Never feed your infant cow's milk. It's just not recommended until after your baby's first birthday because it doesn't have the proper nutrients in the right proportions for a growing infant. It can also cause digestive trouble.Find out more about when to transition your child to regular cow's milk and how to make the switch.What are follow-up formulas, and should I switch to one?Follow-up formulas are specifically designed for babies 4 to 12 months old who are already eating some solids. Follow-up formulas contain more calcium, iron, protein, and calories than infant formulas.Most babies don't need follow-up formula. Doctors encourage parents to introduce solid food (baby cereal, pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables) to their babies at 4 to 6 months, rather than fill them up with formula.Still, it depends on the individual child. Babies with food allergies, those who are very sensitive to different foods, and those with a history of poor growth may benefit from follow-up formula. Talk to your doctor about what's best for your baby.I'd like to supplement breast milk with formula. How should I do it?Lactation consultants suggest waiting to introduce a bottle until the baby is 4 weeks old. By then, breastfeeding is usually well established, but your baby's not yet likely to resist a new kind of nipple. (Nursing and taking a bottle require different types of sucking.)It's best to have someone else give the first bottle because your baby can smell you and your milk and may refuse to take a bottle if you're nearby.If you plan to use formula for occasional feedings, don't offer more than one bottle every 24 hours. Otherwise, your milk production could slow down. If you're returning to work soon and plan to have your caregiver give your baby formula while you're away and nurse when you're home, ease into it by replacing one feeding with a bottle every three to four days.Get more tips on supplementing with formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

"Morning sickness: Causes, concerns, treatments",https://www.babycenter.com/morning-sickness,"Why do they call it morning sickness when I feel nauseated all day long?""Morning sickness"" is a misnomer. For some pregnant women, the symptoms are worse in the morning and ease up over the course of the day, but they can strike at any time and, for many women, last all day long. The intensity of symptoms can also vary from woman to woman too.The medical term for morning sickness is ""nausea and vomiting of pregnancy."" Up to three quarters of pregnant women have at least some nausea or vomiting during the first trimester, and about half have only vomiting. The nausea usually starts around 6 weeks of pregnancy, but it can begin as early as 4 weeks. It tends to get worse over the next month or so.About half of the women who get nausea during pregnancy feel complete relief around 14 weeks. For most others, it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up, though it may return later and come and go throughout pregnancy. A small percentage of women have symptoms that persist continually (or nearly so) until delivery.Of course, just because morning sickness is common  and likely to last ""only"" a few months  doesn't mean it's not a challenge. Even a mild case of nausea can wear you down, and bouts of round-the-clock nausea and vomiting can leave you exhausted and miserable. Talk with your provider about your symptoms and the possibilities for relief.Best and worst pregnancy symptoms (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:46Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:46Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosWhat causes nausea and vomiting during pregnancy?No one knows for sure what causes nausea during pregnancy, but it's probably some combination of the many physical changes taking place in your body. Some possible causes include:Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone rises rapidly during early pregnancy. No one knows how hCG contributes to nausea, but it's a prime suspect because the timing is right: Nausea tends to peak around the same time as levels of hCG. What's more, conditions in which women have higher levels of hCG, such as carrying multiples, are associated with higher rates of nausea and vomiting.Estrogen.Another hormone which rises rapidly in early pregnancy, estrogen is also a possible cause (along with other hormones as well).An enhanced sense of smell and sensitivity to odors.It's not uncommon for a newly pregnant woman to feel overwhelmed by the smell of a bologna sandwich from four cubicles away, for example. Certain aromas instantly trigger the gag reflex. (Some researchers think this may be a result of higher levels of estrogen, but no one knows for sure.)A sensitive stomach.Some women's gastrointestinal tracts are simply more sensitive to the changes of early pregnancy. Also, some research suggests that women with a stomach bacterium calledHelicobacter pylori are more likely to have nausea and vomiting. Not all studies confirm this link, though.Stress.Some researchers have proposed that certain women are psychologically predisposed to having nausea and vomiting during pregnancy as an abnormal response to stress. However, there's no conclusive evidence to support this theory. (Of course, if you're constantly nauseated or vomiting a lot, you certainly may begin to feel more stressed!) Are some pregnant women more likely than others to feel queasy?You're more likely to have nausea or vomiting during your pregnancy if any of the following apply:You'repregnant with twins or higher multiples. This may be from the higher levels of hCG, estrogen, or other hormones in your system. You're also more likely to have a more severe case than average. On the other hand, it's not a definite thing  some women carrying twins have little or no nausea.You had nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy.You have a history of nausea or vomiting as a side effect of taking birth control pills. This is probably related to your body's response to estrogen.You have a history of motion sickness.You have a genetic predisposition to nausea during pregnancy. If your mother or sisters had severe morning sickness, there's a higher chance you will, too.You have a history of migraine headaches.You're carrying a girl. Multiple studies have found that about 55 percent of women with severe nausea and vomiting in the first trimester give birth to a girl.Will my nausea affect my baby?Mild to moderate nausea and occasional vomiting from morning sickness won't threaten your baby's well-being. If you don't gain any weight in the first trimester, it's generally not a problem as long as you're able to stay hydrated and can keep some food down. In most cases, your appetite will return soon enough and you'll start gaining weight.If nausea keeps you from eating a balanced diet, make sure you're getting the nutrients you need by taking aprenatal vitamin.Severe and prolonged vomiting has been linked to a greater risk ofpreterm birth, low birth weight, and newborns who are small for their gestational age. However, a large study of women who were hospitalized with severe vomiting found that those who were able to gain at least 15 pounds during their pregnancy had no worse outcomes than other women.Pregnancy cravings and aversions (Mom confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:00Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:00Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosIf I don't have morning sickness, does that mean I'm more likely to have a miscarriage?Not necessarily. It's true that a number of studies have shown that women who havemiscarriagesare less likely to have had nausea. (If your baby or your placenta was not developing properly, you'd have lower levels of pregnancy hormones in your system. So if that's what causes nausea, it follows that you'd have less.)But there are plenty of women with perfectly normal pregnancies who have little or no nausea during their first trimester. Count yourself lucky and don't worry if you're not suffering!Due Date CalculatorFind out your due date, and see how big your baby is right now. What can I do to get relief?If you have a mild case of nausea and vomiting, some relatively simple measures may be enough to help. (If not, safe and effective medicationsmight help settle your stomach.) Many of the following suggestions are not supported by hard evidence, but obstetricians and midwives commonly recommend them, and many women swear by them.Eat small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day so your stomach is never empty. High-protein foods and complex carbohydrates might be especially helpful. Whatever you eat, eat it slowly.Avoid lying down after eating (especially on your left side) because this can slow digestion.Keep simple snacks, such as crackers, by your bed. When you first wake up, nibble a few crackers and then rest for 20 to 30 minutes before getting up. Snacking on crackers may also help you feel better if you wake up nauseated in the middle of the night.By the way, getting up slowly in the morning  sitting on the bed for a few minutes rather than jumping right up  may also be helpful.Try to avoid foods and smells that trigger your nausea. If that seems like almost everything, it's okay to eat the few things that do appeal to you for this part of your pregnancy, even if they don't add up to a perfectly balanced diet.Try to eat food cold or at room temperature because food tends to have a stronger aroma when it's hot.Avoid fatty foods, which take longer to digest. Also steer clear of spicy, acidic, and fried foods, which can irritate your digestive system. It might help to stick to bland foods.Brush your teeth and rinse your mouth after eating.Try drinking fluids mostly between meals. You might find cold, carbonated beverages easiest to keep down. (Some women also find sour drinks, such as lemonade, easier to handle.)If you've been vomiting a lot, try a sports drink that contains glucose, salt, and potassium to replace lost electrolytes. (The color of your urine indicates whether you're getting enough fluids: It should be clear or pale yellow. If it's dark yellow, that's a sign you need to drink more.)Don't drink so much at one time that your stomach feels full because that will make you less hungry for food. A good strategy is to sip fluids throughout the day. Try using a straw if sipping isn't going well.Be aware of nonfood triggers too: A warm or stuffy room, the smell of heavy perfume, a car ride, or even certain visual stimuli, like flickering lights, might trigger your nausea. So might changing positions too quickly. Avoiding such triggers can become an important part of your treatment.Get fresh air. Taking a walk or opening a window might ease your nausea.Nausea can become worse if you're tired, so give yourself time to relax and take naps when you can. Watching a TV show (preferably not one about food!) or visiting with a friend can help relieve stress and take your mind off your discomfort.Try hypnosis. Although there's no definitive evidence that it helps with morning sickness, it has been shown to be effective in combating nausea during chemotherapy.Try taking yourprenatal vitaminswith food or just before bed. You might also want to ask your healthcare provider whether you can switch to a prenatal vitamin with a low dose ofironor no iron for the first trimester because this mineral can be hard on your digestive system. If the prenatal vitamin still makes you nauseated, ask if you can stop taking it until your nausea gets better, but ask your doctor about taking a folic acid supplement to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.Try ginger, an alternative remedy thought to settle the stomach and relieve queasiness. See if you can find ginger ale made with real ginger. (Most supermarket ginger ales aren't.) Grate some fresh ginger into hot water to make ginger tea, or try ginger candies or crystallized ginger.Taking powdered ginger root in capsules also may provide some relief. Unfortunately, there's no way to be sure how much of the active ingredient you're getting in these ginger supplements, so talk to your provider before taking them. (As with many other things that are helpful in small amounts, the effects of megadoses are unknown.)Some women find similar relief from sipping peppermint tea or sucking peppermint candies, especially after eating.Try an acupressure band, a soft cotton wristband that's sold at drugstores. You strap it on so that the plastic button pushes against an acupressure point on the underside of your wrist. This simple and inexpensive device, designed to ward off seasickness, has helped some pregnant women through morning sickness, although research suggests that it may be largely a placebo effect.Consider seeing an acupuncturist who has experience treating nausea during pregnancy.Ask your provider about a device that stimulates the underside of your wrist with a mild electric current. This ""acustimulation"" device is safe, though it can cause local skin irritation. (Use the gel that comes with it to help prevent this.)Though acustimulation isn't widely used, there is some research showing that it may help. That said, there's certainly no guarantee it will work for you, and these devices are generally not covered by insurance.Experiment with aromatherapy. Some women find scents such as lemon, mint, or orange useful. You can use a diffuser to dispense an essential oil, or you can carry a drop or two of an essential oil on a hanky to smell when you start to feel queasy. (Essential oils are very strong, so use only one or two drops.) What about anti nausea medications?If you've been unable to find relief from your nausea, talk with your provider about medication. There's no need to continue to suffer, and waiting too long to take appropriate medication may make your condition more difficult to treat. See our articles onvitamin B6and othernausea medicationsthat are considered safe and effective during pregnancy.By the way, while it won't help you now, if you plan to get pregnant again, make sure to be taking a multivitamin at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. It may help prevent severe morning sickness, though no one knows why.What if I just can't keep anything down?If your nausea and vomiting are so severe that you can't keep anything down, including water, juice, food, prenatal vitamins, or medications, you probably have a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum. If your situation is that severe, your doctor will most likely want to check you into the hospital and treat you with IV fluids and medications.Talk to your doctor or midwife if:You lose 2 pounds or more.You develop nausea and vomiting after your ninth week of pregnancy.You have nausea and vomiting into your fifth month of pregnancy.You vomit blood.You feel dizzy when you stand.You have signs of dehydration, such as dark-colored urine or infrequent urination.You have abdominal pain, fever, headache, or swelling in the front of the neck.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Alternative and complementary therapies for autism,https://www.babycenter.com/0_alternative-and-complementary-therapies-for-autism_10396947.bc,"Alternative therapies  also called complementary therapies  are medicines or treatments that are usually used along with standard medical care. Most people use the terms interchangeably, and many parents who have a child with autism spectrum disorder try some kind of alternative approach when conventional treatment doesn't seem to work. Here's what you need to know.Should I try alternative therapies for my child with autism?Theres no easy answer. Many families grappling with autism are eager to try anything that could possibly help their child. But alternative therapies are especially tricky because no one knows exactly why they work  or why they don't.""I tell my families I understand their interest in looking into alternative medicine,"" says Kristin Sohl, medical director of the University of Missouri's Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders. ""I say that's fine. However, there are no [alternative] treatments that are absolutely proven to work.""But some alternative therapies do eventually become accepted mainstream treatments. For example, applied behavior analysis (ABA) started out as an alternative therapy for autism and now, after much research, it's a standard approach.ABA uses techniques like positive reinforcement to modify a child's behavior. It used to be considered controversial, but the method is now supported by insurance legislation in nearly 40 states. (Though loopholes in legislation and the claim by some insurance companies that applied behavior analysis is still experimental have led some parents to sue for coverage.)""The status quo thought that ABA was bizarre [in the 1970s and 1980s]. Now it's mainstream,"" says Susan Hyman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics autism subcommittee.Therapies such as ABA have been carefully tested in multiple studies involving large numbers of patients, and the results reviewed by experts before being published in respected journals.On the other hand, most alternative therapies have been investigated in only a few small studies, and that's not enough evidence to prove that a treatment works. Also, flaws in study design, misinterpretation of results, researcher bias, or too few participants are common problems.Safety is another concern. With some treatments, experts don't know what's safe. For example, dietary supplements  such as vitamins, melatonin, and omega-3s  aren't regulated as strictly as prescription and over-the-counter medication. Even when supplements might be helpful, experts may not know the right dose  particularly for children  or whether the supplements could interact with other medications.And theres increasing concern that supplements may not contain the ingredients they purport to and might even be made of unlisted ingredients, including some that could harm a child.A third issue is cost. Shelling out money for a treatment that may not work can be an expensive gamble. Health insurance usually doesn't cover unproven therapies, so you'll probably have to pay out of pocket.How can I tell if an alternative therapy is worth trying?Before you try an alternative therapy, ask your child's doctor if she knows whether a therapy is safe and worth trying. Doctors often aren't opposed to trying alternative therapies as long as they don't seem harmful or interfere with routine treatment. And if you opt to try a particular therapy, keep your child's doctor in the loop so she can coordinate care.Don't try more than one new therapy at a time. If you do, you'll have no way to evaluate what, if anything, is working or causing side effects. Work with your child's doctor to determine how long to try each therapy.""A lot of families go to a holistic provider and get put on a hodgepodge of stuff,"" says Sohl. ""Then they're in a mess, paying thousands of dollars a month, with no way to know if anything is working.""Take careful notes so you can tell if a treatment is working. Write down any changes in your child's symptoms or other possible effects of the treatment.Research alternative treatments with a careful and critical eye. Be wary of claims that seem too good to be true. A good source for learning about alternative therapies and evaluating health claims is theNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Which alternative therapies for autism are probably safe and may be worth trying?Sensory therapyMany children with autism are bothered by loud sounds, bright lights, and touch. Occupational therapy with sensory integration involves exposing children to soothing touch, movement, sound, or smells to lessen autism symptoms.In some small studies, children have shown improvements in self-care and certain social behaviors, along with reduced responsiveness to stimuli.There's no harm in trying sensory therapy. A trial period can help you decide whether it's working for your child.Music therapyFor some children, therapy that incorporates music can be fun and engaging. Supporters say it addresses multiple areas  communication, motor skills, cognitive skills, emotional expression  and can be combined with conventional therapies like ABA.There's little quality research on whether music therapy is effective. Modest evidence suggests it might help with communication and social behavior.Incorporating music into conventional therapy may ease stress and anxiety. It can also be enjoyable for both parents and children.Children who are particularly sensitive to noise might not enjoy this approach. If you try it, the therapist should be able to work with any auditory sensitivity your child might have.There are no apparent risks or adverse side effects with music therapy.YogaPracticing yoga requires discipline, which can be an important skill for children who have autism. Yoga combines meditation and movement, and practitioners value it for helping with relaxation, mindfulness, and overall fitness.A few small studies concluded yoga can help reduce negative behaviors, including social withdrawal and aggression, and improve communication skills.Practicing yoga poses very little risk. As with any exercise program, check with your child's doctor before beginning.Look for a yoga instructor who understands your child's needs and abilities and can adapt sessions accordingly.MassageMassage involves rubbing and light pressure. It may ease pain, reduce anxiety and depression, and lower stress. It can be a very enjoyable experience for children who are comfortable being touched.There's little research on this subject, and existing studies are very small.Massage is unlikely to cause any harm. Be sure to choose a licensed massage therapist, ideally one who belongs to the American Massage Therapy Association.Parents can learn massage techniques to use at home with their child.Therapeutic horseback ridingProponents of animal therapy such as horseback riding (sometimes called equine therapy or hippotherapy) say it helps with mood, emotional control, social interaction, motor skills, and sensory integration.Kids with autism often have trouble interpreting other people's emotions and expressions. Therapeutic riding requires control, focus, communication, and anticipating the horse's movements, Hyman says. Practice anticipating how a horse will react may help children anticipate people's reactions.A few small studies on horseback riding and autism suggest this therapy may be beneficial.Riding sessions can be expensive. Prices vary widely but $30 to $60 for a 20- to 45-minute session is a ballpark range. Therapeutic riding isn't usually covered by insurance but might be if a professional therapist oversees the sessions.Make sure your child wears a helmet. The instructor or therapist should always accompany your child and check that the helmet, saddle, stirrups, and other equipment are safe and secure.Even if you don't see obvious improvement from therapeutic riding, it still may be a fun activity for your family. ""It's okay to have fun and experience joy with your child,"" says Hyman.Which alternative therapies for autism may be risky or are less likely to work?Gluten- and casein-free dietsFor unknown reasons, many children with autism suffer from digestive issues. Parents of kids with these problems sometimes experiment with eliminating gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) and casein (a protein found in dairy) from their child's diet. Some see improvement in behavior and autism symptoms  better eye contact, for example, and greater attention span  when their child's meals don't contain gluten, casein, or both.The few studies that have explored any connection between autism symptoms and casein or gluten are inconclusive.A restricted diet risks depriving your child of important nutrients including calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins A, D, and B. Some children on gluten- and casein-free diets have been found to have lower bone density. It's important to work with your child's doctor and, if possible, a nutritionist to review your child's diet and make sure he's getting the nutrients he needs for healthy development.Casein- and gluten-free diets are difficult to maintain and can be expensive.Don't make sudden, drastic dietary changes. If your child tries this diet, focus on eliminating either gluten or casein at first  not both. Read food labels carefully to avoid these proteins.Your child's doctor may want to test for celiac disease, a genetic disease in which gluten damages the small intestine. She can help you figure out how to investigate whether gluten or casein may be problematic for your child.Note that these restricted diets usually emphasize healthier, unprocessed foods, and that shift could be the reason for any improvement in symptoms. For example, seeing improvement after eliminating dairy products could point to lactose intolerance rather than a problem with casein.Learn more about celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity.B6, B12, and other vitaminsSome small studies suggest children with autism have nutritional deficiencies that may influence their symptoms. One theory is that a shortage of certain nutrients could damage cells, which in turn may play a part in neurological issues. Some vitamins used in therapy include B6 (taken with magnesium), B12 (methyl), and C.A few small studies on vitamin therapies have yielded interesting results that researchers are still exploring.Vitamin supplements can be toxic in high doses. Large amounts of B6, for example, can cause nerve damage, digestive issues, irritability, incontinence, and other problems.Avoid supplements that are administered in concentrated form by injection, an invasive procedure than can hurt and be stressful for children.Learn more about children's vitamins.MelatoninChildren with autism often have trouble settling down and going to sleep. It's not clear why, but preliminary research has suggested that the brain systems that regulate sleep may be disrupted in children with autism.Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate the sleep cycle. The synthetic version is a popular therapy for kids with autism.Several small studies suggest melatonin supplements may help children with autism fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly.Many consider melatonin safe in small doses for short-term use, but its hard to know whats in a product since the supplement industry is largely unregulated. Also, it's unknown whether long-term use is safe, and there are no formal dosing recommendations. Ask your child's doctor for guidance.Melatonin might not be safe for children with certain conditions, including diabetes or seizure disorders, because it can affect their hormone levels.Before you try melatonin, talk with your child's doctor about whether your child might have another condition affecting his sleep.Omega-3sOmega-3 fatty acids are important for brain development and function. The best source of omega-3s is seafood, and it's unclear whether supplements provide the same benefits. Omega-3 supplements are sometimes recommended for children with autism to ease hyperactivity and repetitive behavior.A few very small studies suggest omega-3 supplements may reduce hyperactivity.Side effects are uncommon but may involve gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or indigestion.There is no recommended dose for children, and it's hard to know exactly what you're getting in any particular product. Your child's doctor might be able to recommend a brand and dose.Talk with your child's doctor before starting omega-3 supplements, which can worsen bleeding disorders.You might want to explore boosting your child's omega-3 intake through his diet instead of turning to supplements (but follow dietary guidelines to minimize his exposure to mercury). Types of fish low in mercury and high in healthy fats include anchovy, herring, mackerel (Atlantic, jack, chub), rainbow trout (farm raised), salmon (wild or farm raised), sardines, shad (American), and whitefish. Which alternative therapies for autism are dangerous or dont work?Hyperbaric oxygenHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves inhaling concentrated oxygen in a pressure chamber, which leads to more oxygen-rich blood flowing through the body. HBOT is often used to treat carbon monoxide poisoning, wounds that won't heal, and decompression sickness related to scuba diving.Research has explored whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy could improve autism symptoms by increasing oxygen to the brain to reduce inflammation, but so far the therapy appears ineffective.HBOT hasn't been studied enough to determine whether it's safe for children.This therapy can cause ear injuries, seizures, and nearsightedness.Treatments can cost $150 to $900 each, and home chambers  which have been blamed for deaths due to fire and explosions  can cost as much as $17,000.ChelationThis treatment claims to flush heavy metals from a child's body by using drugs that bind to iron, lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc, and some other metals. The metals are then eliminated from a child's body when he urinates. Chelation is an accepted treatment for lead poisoning or an overload of iron stemming from a blood disorder.There's no evidence chelation has any effect on autism symptoms  nor is there any evidence that mercury or other metals targeted by chelation play a role in autism.Chelation can sap a child's body of calcium, iron, and magnesium.This therapy can cause kidney damage, irregular heartbeat, and death. Injections are especially risky  one child with autism died after being injected with sodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), a drug used for chelation.Antiviral and antifungal treatmentSome people suspect that autism is caused by a virus or fungal infection and try antiviral or antifungal medication to combat the disorder.There is no evidence that viral or fungal infections cause autism.These medications can have serious side effects including allergic reactions, anemia, and liver damage.Sohl has a patient whose parents have used antiviral injections for 15 years. ""I have desperately tried to get them to stop because I'm worried about the long-term side effects, but they say they don't know what he'd be like if they stopped."" When asked to prescribe the injections, Sohl says no.SecretinSecretin is a hormone produced by the small intestine that regulates the secretions of the stomach and pancreas. For a time, it was thought to help improve functioning in kids with autism, especially with language skills. According to Hyman, hundreds and maybe thousands of kids in the United States were infused with secretin.""There is a good, solid body of research that demonstrated it does not improve language,"" says Hyman.Read our overview for parents to learn more about autism.Learn the early signs of autism and who to see if you suspect your child has autism.Show sources Hide sources Kristin Sohl, a pediatrician who specializes in autism and medical director of the University of Missouri's Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders, one of 15 multidisciplinary centers in the U.S. that are part of Autism Speaks' Autism Treatment Network.Dr. Susan Hyman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' autism subcommittee.Raphael Bernier, clinical director at Seattle Children's Autism Clinic and an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Washington.American Psychiatric Association.

Best foods for new moms: Mood boosters,https://www.babycenter.com/0_best-foods-for-new-moms-mood-boosters_1458835.bc,"It's not uncommon to feel down for the first couple of weeks after childbirth. You're recovering physically from labor and delivery, dealing with postpartum hormonal swings, and adjusting to life with the newest  and most demanding  member of your family. All this can leave you feeling exhausted, cranky, and anxious.And while feeding yourself may be last on your to-do list, eating healthy food, having regular meals and snacks, and taking a few simple steps can boost yourenergy leveland your mood. Read on for our best nutrition tips.Editor's note: If you suspect you're suffering frompostpartum depression(PPD) rather than a temporary case of the""baby blues,"" tell your care provider right away.PPD is a serious condition that requires treatment. A healthy diet can improve your mood, but it can't substitute for professional help. Warning signs of PPD include insomnia, a change in appetite, weepiness or sadness that persists all day, and thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.Stock up on omega-3 fatty acidsExperts agree that omega-3s fatty acids  found mainly in fish and some nuts and seeds  are important to include in a healthy diet. They help your body function normally and protect against heart disease. And some studies show lower overall rates of depression (including a lower incidence of postpartum depression among new moms) in countries where people eat large amounts of fish.Pediatrician James Sears, coauthor ofThe Baby Book, advises new mothers to stock up on foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like wild salmon, flaxseed oil, and walnuts. He believes these enhance brain function and can help with depression. ""Omega-3 oils really help the brain work better,"" Sears says.The Institute of Medicine recommends women consume 1.1 grams (1,100 mg) of omega-3 fatty acids every day. Breastfeeding women should get slightly more, about 1.3 grams. The following foods each provide about 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acid:1 tablespoon walnut oil = 1.4 grams1 ounce black walnuts = 0.6 gram1 tablespoon canola oil = 1.3 grams1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds = 1.6 grams1 1/2 ounces herring = 1 gram2 1/2 ounces of Atlantic salmon = 1 gram4 ounces of canned white tuna = 1 gramOmega-3-fortified eggs are also an option. Two eggs provide about half the daily amount recommended above, depending on the brand.Consider taking a supplement if you don't like the taste of fish or if you're eating fish less often because ofmercury concerns. (Nursing moms should eat 8 to 12 ounces of cooked fish or canned ""light"" tuna and up to 6 ounces of canned albacore tuna a week, according to joint guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.)Omega-3 supplements made from fish oils are considered safe for nursing moms. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, they don't have detectable levels of mercury or toxins. But skip cod liver oil supplements if you're breastfeeding because they can contain excessive amounts of vitamins A and D.If you're taking a supplement, read the label to determine how much omega-3 fatty acid each capsule contains, and ask your doctor to recommend a dosage for you. Starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it or taking the pills with meals lessens the chance of having side effects like diarrhea, bloating, and nausea. Don't skimp on proteinIt's especially important to get enough protein in your diet now, says Shoshana Bennett, a psychologist on the advisory council of Postpartum Support International (PSI), an advocacy and support group for women with PPD.Bennett says that eating small amounts of protein throughout the day helps keep blood sugar levels even and moods stable. And consuming dairy products, poultry, meat, and fish  along with low-glycemic carbs like nuts, whole grains, and beans  can boost production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter which has a calming effect on the brain.To get more protein in your diet, try having scrambled eggs for breakfast, a turkey or roast beef sandwich for lunch, and yogurt or cheese and crackers for a snack.The total amount of protein you need daily depends on how much you weigh and whether you're nursing. The average range is 50 to 85 grams of protein a day for nursing moms, and 30 to 55 grams for moms who aren't nursing.If you're very petite or on the heavier side, your protein requirement might fall outside these ranges. Check the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food planning tool, MyPlate to find out how much protein you need.These are some good sources of protein:3 ounces chicken, turkey, or meat = 20 to 25 grams protein3 ounces fish = about 20 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses milk = 16 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses soy milk = 14 grams proteinTwo large eggs = 12 grams protein2 ounces Swiss cheese = 16 grams protein1/2 block firm tofu = 14 grams protein1 cup cottage cheese = 22 to 31 grams protein1 cup plain low-fat yogurt = 12 grams protein2 ounces dry-roasted peanuts = 14 grams protein1 cup cooked beans, such as chickpeas (garbanzo beans), kidney beans, baked beans, pinto beans, refried beans, or black beans = 12 to 19 grams protein1 cup cooked lentils = 18 grams proteinDrink plenty of liquidDehydration may make the blues worse. Fatigue and anxiety are actually symptoms of moderate dehydration. So drink at least nine 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day (about 13 glasses if you're breastfeeding). Choose water or noncaffeinated beverages that aren't sweetened with sugar.Also, don't wait to drink until you feel thirsty. (By the time you notice your thirst, mild dehydration may have already kicked in.) This is especially important if you're breastfeeding because nursing can make you extra thirsty. Grab a tall glass of water, juice, or even decaf iced tea every time you sit down to nurse your baby. Limit your alcohol intakeThough it may give you a quick buzz, alcohol is a depressant, so limit your drinking until you're on a more even keel. An occasional glass of wine in the evening to unwind isn't a problem, but regular heavy drinking may make your mood worse and disrupt your sleep. Depression and alcoholism often go hand in hand, so if you feel like your drinking is spiraling out of control, talk to your healthcare provider.There are other reasons to abstain from drinking during the postpartum period. Having more than an infrequent drink can affect yourability to nurseand take care of your child.Moderate your caffeine intakeA cup or two of coffee can get you going in the morning, but if you're guzzling caffeinated beverages all day long, you're more likely to end up jittery, frazzled, and unable to sleep at night. ""Caffeine is public enemy number one  it is horrible for anxiety,"" says Bennett. ""It makes people agitated, irritable, and restless,"" she says, noting that those are also symptoms of mood disorders.Plus, if you're breastfeeding, doctors recommend having no more than300 mg of caffeine a day (about what you'd get in two 8-ounce cups of coffee) to avoid affecting your baby.Abruptly giving up all caffeine can cause temporary headaches, lethargy, and crankiness. So if you drink a lot of the stuff, don't just quit cold turkey. Slowly cut back to a few caffeinated beverages a day  or none if you want to be caffeine-free.Go for dark chocolate when you're craving sweetsIt's easy to reach for junk food when you're tired and need some quick calories, but try to resist the urge. Junk food may give you a temporary lift, but that surge comes with an eventual crash. If you do indulge occasionally, don't beat yourself up about it. ""If you have to eat something with a lot of sugar, eat some chocolate,"" says registered dietitian Jo Ann Hattner.High-quality dark chocolate  at least 70 percent cocoa  can improve mood by increasing the serotonin level in your brain. And some studies indicate that chocolate consumption triggers the release of endorphins, brain chemicals responsible for euphoric feelings.Don't forget your vitaminsAlthough a supplement is no substitute for a healthy diet rich infruits and veggies, it can be difficult to cover all your nutritional bases during those first few busy weeks with a new baby. So keep taking yourprenatal vitaminfor a couple months postpartum.Prenatal vitamins generally contain more iron than regular multivitamins, which is important because your iron stores may be depleted after pregnancy and giving birth (especially if you had a cesarean section). Low iron levels can leave you feeling fatigued and down. Also, antioxidants  including vitamins A, C, and E  may improve overall brain function, according to Bennett.Pay attention to your appetiteIt's normal to skip meals and forget to eat on a regular schedule during the harried first weeks of caring for a newborn. But if you find that you're rarely hungry and eating is a chore, your loss of appetite may be a symptom of postpartum depression.Eating poorly can also contribute to mood problems. Your body needs regular, balanced meals and snacks to keep blood sugar levels stable. When they're not, it can affect your mood. If you consistently have to force yourself to eat, talk to your care provider.More informationThe USDA's MyPlate tool offers a customized daily food plan based on your age, gender, and activity level.Get recipes forquick, nutritious snacks for time-starved moms.See ourdiet for a healthy breastfeeding momanddiet for healthy postpartum weight loss.Visit ourMom's Nutrition: Postpartumindex page.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Managing iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_managing-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnancy_10414724.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHow do I know I have iron-deficiency anemia?If you have iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), you might not have any symptoms at all, especially if your condition is mild. Or you might feel tired, weak, or dizzy. You might experience these symptoms during pregnancy anyway, so you may not know you have iron-deficiency anemia until you have a blood test.Because IDA is a common condition during pregnancy, your healthcare provider will test your blood for anemia at your first prenatal appointment.Even if you're not anemic at the beginning of pregnancy, it's common to develop anemia as your pregnancy progresses, so you'll have another blood test in your second or third trimester.How is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?Various blood tests determine if you have iron-deficiency anemia. Your provider uses a test called a complete blood count (CBC) to see if you have anemia. This test measures various aspects of blood, but when it's used to diagnose anemia, the hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb or Hb) levels are the important numbers in a CBC.Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin transports oxygen around your body. Your blood will be tested to see the number of grams of hemoglobin you have in your blood.The hematocrit measurement shows the percentage of red blood cells in plasma, the fluid component of blood. Low levels of hemoglobin or hematocrit are signs of anemia.If Hgb levels are less than 11 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood (g/dL) and the Hct level is less than 33 percent in the first trimester of pregnancy, you'll be diagnosed with anemia. (These levels apply to the third trimester as well.)It's normal for hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to go down somewhat in the second trimester of pregnancy. At this stage, the amount of blood in the body is expanding dramatically, and the amount of plasma increases faster than the number and size of red blood cells. In the second trimester, you'll be diagnosed with anemia if you have an Hgb level of 10.5 g/dL and an Hct level of 32 percent.A number of conditions can cause anemia but iron deficiency is the most common. So your healthcare provider will likely treat you for iron-deficiency anemia without suggesting any further tests to confirm the diagnosis.What if I have anemia and my iron levels don't improve?If your iron levels don't begin to improve after starting treatment, or your provider isn't sure whether your anemia is caused by a lack of iron or another condition, she may suggest additional testing to confirm the diagnosis. This test could be one or more of the following:Serum ferritin testThis is another type of blood test. It's considered the most accurate and sensitive test for measuring IDA.Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in cells. The amount of ferritin in blood also shows how much iron there is.Reticulocyte countReticulocytes are immature red blood cells. A reticulocyte count shows whether the body is making enough new red blood cells.Peripheral smearIn this test, the size and shape of red blood cells are examined under a microscope. If you have IDA, the blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal.Serum ironThis test measures the amount of iron in blood.Transferrin levelTransferrin carries iron in the blood. The transferrin level, also known as the total iron-binding capacity, measures how much transferrin in blood isn't carrying iron.What's the treatment for iron-deficiency anemia?Although there's iron in many foods, eating an iron-rich diet won't be enough to treat anemia. So your provider will prescribe iron supplements.The supplement is tailored to you and the amount of extra iron you need, but typically contains between 60 and 120 milligrams (mg) of iron a day. You also need to take a standard prenatal vitamin, which contains approximately 30 mg of iron.These doses refer to the amount of elemental iron, or pure iron, in a supplement. Some labels list the amount of the iron compound instead of, or in addition to, the amount of elemental iron. Here's how much elemental iron is in each compound:Ferrous sulfate: 325 mg has about 65 mg of elemental iron. (Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly used iron supplement.)Ferrous gluconate: 300 mg has about 34 mg of elemental iron.Ferrous fumarate: 325 mg has about 106 mg of elemental iron.Read labels closely and talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions.How do I get the most out of my iron supplement?In order to absorb as much of the iron as possible, take iron supplements either one hour before or two hours after eating.How long will it take for iron levels to rise?For most women, iron supplements are an effective treatment for anemia. Within two weeks of starting to take iron supplements, hemoglobin levels should begin to rise, although it may be a month or two before you're tested again.If there's no improvement in iron levels, your provider may want to investigate whether your anemia is caused by something other than iron deficiency.If additional testing rules this out and confirms IDA instead, your provider may recommend parenteral iron. This is iron given intravenously, either in the hospital or at your provider's office.One important point to note about iron tablets: They're safe to take during pregnancy, but keep them in childproof containers and stored away from children.What are the side effects of iron supplements?Unfortunately, iron supplements have common side effects. Constipation is a problem if you're taking iron tablets, as is a feeling of bloating, nausea, and sometimes having an upset tummy.If nausea is a problem, you might be able to reduce it by timing when you take your iron supplements. Taking them a couple of hours after eating may suit you better than taking them first thing in the morning on a completely empty stomach. Or you may want to take them at bedtime to try to sleep through the worst of the nausea.You'll probably notice that your stool changes color and becomes darker than normal, which is a perfectly normal result of the extra amount of iron in your body.Although the side effects might be unpleasant, don't stop taking your supplements. If they cause problems, talk to your provider.There are a number of options to reduce symptoms. These include:Splitting the dose into smaller quantities to take at intervals during the day.Trying an alternative brand or type of iron supplement.Switching to the liquid form of ferrous sulfate instead of tablets. This makes it easier to adjust the dose until your symptoms become more tolerable.The downside is that these options can take longer to build up iron stores in the body because they have a lower amount of iron than the typical supplement.Will I see my healthcare provider more often?It's normal to experience mild anemia in pregnancy, so if you take iron supplements as directed, you're unlikely to need additional treatment. In most cases, you'll have your blood tested again during the second or third trimester to see if things have improved.If anemia is severe and you have very low iron levels, then you may need to have blood tests more frequently  as often as every month  so your provider can monitor you carefully.If you have severe anemia, you may also need extra care. Typically your provider will refer you to a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist for care. You may also need to have intravenous iron supplementation.You may have a blood transfusion if your anemia is so severe that you're experiencing complications that could be dangerous to you or your baby. However, it's rare to need a blood transfusion during pregnancy. Most women are treated successfully with iron supplements or an intravenous iron infusion.Does changing what I eat help?Yes. Iron from iron-rich food is absorbed well by the body. Having an iron-rich diet protects against iron-deficiency anemia, and consuming iron-rich food with iron supplements can build up iron stores.Examples of healthy, iron-rich foods include:Red meatEnriched breakfast cerealsBeansLentilsShrimpTurkey (dark meat)The body absorbs iron from animal sources (heme iron) much more easily than iron from nonanimal sources (nonheme iron).Eating or drinking something rich in vitamin C when you take an iron supplement or eating iron-rich plant foods can help the body absorb significantly more nonheme iron. Good vitamin C choices include a glass of orange or tomato juice, a handful of strawberries, sliced bell peppers, or half a grapefruit.Calcium, found in milk, cheese and yogurt, is an important component of a healthy pregnancy diet but hinders the body's ability to absorb iron. Don't drink milk with meals or when you take an iron supplement. Also, don't add cheese to iron-rich recipes.The same goes for tea and coffee, which also interfere with the absorption of iron.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

How to buy baby formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-baby-formula_1334669.bc,"I'm bottle-feeding my baby. Which formula is best?It's easy to feel overwhelmed in the formula aisle. Choosing the right nourishment for your baby is a pretty weighty decision, and there are lots of options.When choosing formula, consider the form it comes in, the type of protein and carbohydrate it provides, and what other ingredients are included. In the end, you'll be able to choose the formula that is best for your baby and your family's lifestyle.What are the different forms of formula?Formulas come in three forms: Ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powdered.Ready-to-use formula is undoubtedly the most convenient  no mixing or measuring required, just open and serve. It's the kind of formula that hospitals often give to newborns. It's hygienic and especially helpful when you don't know whether you'll have access to safe water.The convenience of ready-to-use formula comes at a price  this kind costs about 20 percent more per ounce than powdered formula. The containers also take up more storage space in your cupboard and more space in the landfill (unless you can recycle the containers).Once opened, ready-to-use formula has a short lifespan  it must be used within 48 hours. Also, because liquid formula is often darker than powdered formula, many moms complain that it's more likely to stain clothes.Liquid concentrate formula requires mixing equal parts of water and formula. Compared to ready-to-use formula, concentrate is less expensive and takes up less storage space. Compared to powdered formula, it's a little easier to prepare but more expensive.Powdered formula is the most economical and the most environmentally friendly formula option. It takes up the least amount of space in transport, in your pantry, and in your trash can.Powdered formula takes more time to prepare than other types of formula, and you must follow the directions exactly, but it has a one-month shelf life after the container has been opened. As with liquid concentrate formula, you can mix up just the right amount  as much or as little as you want  whenever you need it. This is especially helpful if you're a breastfeeding mom who may only need a supplemental bottle occasionally. What are the different types of formula?There's a formula to suit every baby's needs. But it's best to stick with one type and resist the urge to switch, even if your baby seems like he's not digesting the formula well at first.Common problems  like spitting up, gas, and colic  are usually unrelated to your baby's diet. Most of the time, these problems have to do with your baby's immature gastrointestinal tract, not what he's eating.So try out a particular type of formula for at least a couple weeks. After that, if your baby's still having trouble, talk to his doctor about switching.Cow's-milk-based formula: Most formula available today has cow's milk as the main ingredient. The overwhelming majority of formula-fed and formula-supplemented babies do best with this type of formula because it has just the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The milk protein in formula is significantly altered to make it easier to digest. Your baby won't be able to digest regular cow's milk until after his first birthday.Partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulas: In these formulas, the protein is broken down into small parts (partially hydrolyzed) or even smaller parts (extensively hydrolyzed) that are easier for your baby to digest than larger protein molecules. Your baby may need a hydrolyzed formula if he has a milk protein allergy or trouble absorbing nutrients (a common problem for preemies). The doctor may also suggest trying a hydrolyzed formula if your baby has a skin condition such as eczema.Soy-based formula: These formulas are made with a plant protein that, like the protein in cow's milk, is modified for easy digestion. Although soy-based formulas are a good option for vegan families, there are only a few medical reasons for using them. These include:Transient lactose deficiency: a temporary lactose intolerance caused by a gastrointestional infectionImmunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy to cow's milk: an allergy to cow's milk protein that causes immediate symptoms, including wheezing, runny nose, hives, and rashes. Many babies with IgE-associated milk allergy are also allergic to soy protein, so don't give soy formulas to your child unless your doctor recommends it.Galactosemia: a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to break down a milk sugar (galactose) to produce energyCongenital lactase deficiency: an extremely rare inherited disorder in which a baby is born with very little or none of the enzyme that breaks down the sugar lactose found in milk, causing life-threatening lactose intolerance symptomsLactose-free formula: A case of lactose intolerance or an inability to digest lactose  the sugar naturally found in milk  is rare. If your baby is lactose intolerant, his doctor may recommend a soy formula or another formula in which the lactose is replaced with a different sugar, such as corn syrup.Formula for premature and low-birth-weight babies: These formulas often contain more calories and protein, as well as a more easily absorbed type of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). How much MCT is in these formulas varies by brand. Your baby's doctor will help you select the one that will help your baby gain just the right amount of weight.Human milk fortifier: This product is used to enrich the nutrition of breastfed babies who have special needs. Some are designed to be mixed with breast milk, and some are meant to be fed alternately with breast milk.Metabolic formula: If your baby has a disease that requires very specific nutrition, he may need one of these specially developed formulas.Organic formula: According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), no research to date has proven organic milk to be healthier for children than regular milk. Since standard formula is based on milk, parents may want to consider whether organic formula is worth the higher price.Other specialty formula: New formulas come out all the time and are marketed to moms to help babies with digestion to relieve problems such as colic or acid reflux. These formulas have a protein ratio similar to breast milk and vary slightly in composition from regular formula  but some experts say they may not be any better.""More often than not, specialty formulas are substantially more expensive and not significantly different in key nutritional value, says KT Park, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. ""Babies undergo tremendous adaptation of their gastrointestinal tract during the first six months of life, which is normal. There are very few scenarios in which infants would require the more expensive formulas.""If you think your child might benefit from a specialty formula, ask your child's doctor about it before you stock up. How do formulas differ?There are five main components to formula: Carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, plus other nutrients in smaller quantities. What makes one brand of formula different from the next are the specific carbohydrates and proteins as well as any additional ingredients. For example, casein and whey are two kinds of cow's milk proteins found in various proportions in different brands of cow's-milk-based formula.It's very easy to get confused by all of the items listed on the ingredient label. Below is a guide through the maze of ingredients and a comparison to the ones found in breast milk.Carbohydrate: Lactose is the main carbohydrate in both breast milk and formulas made from cow's-milk. Corn maltodextrin is sometimes used as a secondary source of carbohydrate in formula. Lactose-free, soy, and special formulas contain one or more of the following carbohydrates: Sucrose, corn maltodextrin, modified cornstarch, or corn syrup solids.Protein: Breast milk contains about 60 percent whey and 40 percent casein. Most formulas have similar protein content. Others contain 100 percent whey.Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not hypoallergenic  don't use one if your baby has a protein allergy, or even if you suspect she may have one. However, compared to standard cow's-milk formula, partially hydrolyzed whey formulas have been shown in studies to reduce eczema.Extensively hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that are completely broken down into their building blocks (amino acids), which allow them to be easily absorbed. These formulas are considered hypoallergenic and are used for babies who have a protein allergy.Soy formulas contain soy protein isolate  a processed soybean ingredient that is almost pure protein (at least 90 percent). Some brands use partially hydrolyzed soy protein (protein is partially broken down) to allow easier digestion.Fat: Breast milk contains a blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fat. Formulas use a variety of oils to match the fat makeup of breast milk. They include soy oil, coconut oil, palm or palm olein oil, and high oleic sunflower oil.Although palm and palm olein oil is widely used, research has shown that these fats can reduce absorption of fat and calcium. This would mean that your baby would not absorb as much fat and calcium as she would from a formula that doesn't contain this oil.Medium-chain triglycerides require less effort to digest and are more easily absorbed. They're used in special formulas for premature infants and for infants who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients.The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the addition of two long-chain fatty acids to formula: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are now standard ingredients in formula. Both of these substances are found in breast milk when the mother's diet is adequate, and both are important for brain and vision development. Babies get DHA and ARA from their mother during the third trimester, but the transfer is cut short when a baby is born prematurely. All babies need a steady supply of both substances throughout their first year.Numerous studies support the supplementation of formula with DHA and ARA. One, a report published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that full-term infants fed DHA- and ARA-supplemented formula had significantly clearer vision than infants who did not receive the supplements. And a study published in The Journal of Pediatrics states that DHA and ARA enhanced both cognitive and physical growth in preterm infants.There aren't any long-term studies confirming the safety of these substances, although there's no evidence suggesting that these additives are harmful to babies, either. The AAP hasn't taken a position on whether these fatty acids should be added to formula, but the organization does point out that they're believed to be important in brain and eye development.Vitamins and minerals: Most words on the ingredient label describe vitamins and minerals. These words can be hard to figure out  ferrous sulfate is iron, for example. Sodium ascorbate is vitamin C, and calcium pantothenate is vitamin B5.The AAP recommends that all healthy babies who aren't breastfed exclusively be given iron-fortified formula until their first birthday. It's important that babies receive the minimum recommended amount of iron (0.27 milligrams [mg] daily for infants 0 to 6 months; 11 mg daily for babies 7 to 12 months) to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.Iron is vital to the blood's ability to circulate oxygen, which all of the body's cells need to function properly. Studies have shown that getting enough iron in the first year of life is important for brain development. A baby's iron stores are established in the third trimester, so premature babies need extra help in getting plenty of iron.Most formulas contain at least 4 mg of iron per liter, although ""low-iron"" formulas are still on the shelves. These were developed years ago in response to the misconception that iron causes constipation. The AAP would like these low-iron formulas to be discontinued or labeled as nutritionally inadequate.Nucleotides: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, naturally present in breast milk. They have several functions and may aid in immune system development. Different brands of formula have different amounts of nucleotides added.Rice starch: Rice starch is added to ""anti-regurgitation"" formulas. Your doctor may recommend this type of formula to alleviate your baby's acid reflux.Dietary fiber: Soy fiber is added to soy formula for the temporary treatment of diarrhea. The only formula containing fiber is Similac Expert Care for Diarrhea, which is clinically shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea.Amino acids: Amino acids such as taurine, methionine, and carnitine are added to soy formulas, and sometimes to cow's-milk formulas, to match the amino acids in breast milk.Probiotics and prebiotics: Probiotics are a type of live bacteria that may help prevent intestinal infections and inflammation. Prebiotics boost the numbers of probiotic bacteria in the gut.The AAP says some studies show probiotics and prebiotics can play a role in keeping your child's digestive system healthy but they can also be unsafe for babies with compromised immune systems and certain other medical conditions, so it's best to check with your baby's doctor before using these formulas. Any benefit from probiotics and prebiotics goes away once your baby stops using them. Are generic brands nutritionally adequate?Generic brands of formula must meet the FDA's requirements for nutrients in formula, so in many instances, the only difference between generic and brand name is the price.Whether you're buying generic or name brand, take a minute to look at the label before you purchase the formula. Specific ingredients do vary from brand to brand, and this can make a difference to your baby.Can I make my own formula?Doctors strongly advise against it. If you made your own formula, it would be impossible to include all the ingredients in the right amounts for your baby. Homemade formula could lead to failure to gain weight, malnourishment, or even death.What about adding cereal or milk to my baby's formula?Never add any ingredients  including vitamins, cereal, fatty acids, olive oil, regular cow's milk, or anything else  to your baby's formula unless your doctor recommends it. Formula is a carefully developed substance with precise amounts of dozens of nutrients. Adding anything to formula could jeopardize your baby's health.Olive oil, for example, can lead to permanent lung damage and even death, because of the danger of inhaling the oil into the lungs when spitting up. Because cow's milk is so hard for babies to digest, never mix cow's milk with formula or give it to your baby straight until he's at least 1 year old. And adding breast milk to formula is a waste of breast milk if your baby doesn't drink the entire bottle.What if I'm still not sure which formula is right for my baby?If you've decided to feed your baby formula and you're still baffled by the many options available, or you're considering switching formulas, talk with your baby's doctor. He'll consider your baby's health, age, and nutritional needs and make an appropriate recommendation.He can also monitor your baby's reactions and investigate any symptoms. Don't try to diagnose an allergy or sensitivity on your own. You could miss a serious underlying condition or prevent your baby from getting adequate nutrition.If you'd like to learn more, visit the FDA pages on infant formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Calcium in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_calcium-in-your-childs-diet_10324689.bc,"Calcium is crucial for good health and development. Read on to find out how much calcium your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why calcium is importantCalcium is vital for building strong bones and teeth, promoting nerve and muscle function, helping blood clot, and activating the enzymes that convert food into energy. About 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the teeth and bones. And because children are growing new bone all the time, they need a steady supply of calcium to support healthy growth.How much calcium does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 700 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 1,000 mg per dayYour child doesn't have to get the recommended amount of calcium every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of calciumDairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are some of the best sources of calcium, but you'll also find it in some unexpected places. Here are some calcium-rich foods to try:1/4 cup raw tofu prepared with calcium sulfate: 217 mg (The calcium content of tofu varies, depending on how it's processed. Check the label.)1/2 cup plain yogurt: 207 mg1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses: 172 mg1/2 cup fruit yogurt: 122 to 192 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified orange juice: 133 to 250 mg1/4 cup ricotta cheese: 167 mg1/2 cup milk: 150 mg1/2 cup chocolate milk: 144 mg1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 112 mg1/2 cup vanilla frozen yogurt, soft-serve: 102 mg1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 102 mg1 slice whole grain bread: 24 mg1/2 ounce mozzarella cheese: 103 mg1/4 cup collard greens: 66 mg1/4 cup homemade pudding (from mix or scratch): 76 mg1 tablespoon tahini (sesame seed butter): 64 mg1/4 cup turnip greens: 50 mg1/4 cup cooked spinach: 60 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified cereal (ready to eat): 51 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified soy beverage: 40 to 250 mgThe amount of calcium a food contains varies somewhat, depending on the brand, the size of the fruit or vegetable, and so on. Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, depending on their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Calcium content isn't affected by fat, but the dietary fat in dairy products plays an important role in your child's development. Children younger than 2 need to get half their calories from fat for healthy growth and brain development, so they should eat only full-fat dairy products. But unless your doctor advises otherwise, children older than 2 need to get fewer calories from fat, so they should eat low-fat or nonfat dairy products to maintain a healthy weight.Tips for maximizing your child's calcium intakeSome experts believe that many children are falling short of their calcium requirement. This could be partly because juice and other nondairy drinks are so popular that kids are drinking less milk. Here are some simple steps you can take to make sure your child gets enough calcium:Use milk instead of water when preparing cereal, hot cocoa, and soup.Use evaporated milk in place of regular milk in recipes  it has twice the calcium of regular milk.Add yogurt to fruit salads; nonfat milk powder to pancake batter, sauces, and smoothies; and cheese to vegetables, sauces, and mashed potatoes.Buy calcium-fortified juice, bread, and cereal.Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, so make sure your child gets enough vitamin D  about 600 international units (IU) per day.Can your child get too much calcium?An extremely high level of calcium in the blood is usually due to an underlying medical condition rather than consuming too much calcium in food and supplements. The Institute of Medicine recommends that kids age 1 to 8 get no more than 2,500 mg of calcium daily  that's roughly the equivalent of eight 8-ounce glasses of milk. While it's a good idea to keep an eye on how much calcium your child gets from her diet, it's unlikely that she will get too much calcium from food alone.Calcium supplements, on the other hand, can sometimes be a problem. For instance, taking excess calcium supplements has been linked to a higher risk of kidney stones.A couple of notes of caution: If your child is a big milk drinker, make sure she's not getting too many extra calories from milk alone, or that she doesn't fill up on milk and then have no appetite for other healthy foods. Also, too much calcium can cause constipation.Find out more: Nine other important nutrients for childrenShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2013. Dietary fat and toddlers.

Parents Say: How I get my child to take fish oil supplements?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_parents-say-how-i-get-my-child-to-take-fish-oil-supplements_10326580.bc,"If your family doesn't eat fish regularly, ask your child's doctor if your child should take a fish oil supplement.Fish oil supplementscontain omega-3 fatty acidsthat experts say are important for your child's brain and eye development. And fish oil contains other beneficial nutrients  like vitamin D, which helps maintain healthy bones.Supplements tend to taste fishy, and it can be tricky to get children to take them.

How to get pregnant fast,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-pregnant-fast_10337115.bc,"Maybe you're just really eager to get pregnant, or maybe you hope that your baby will be born at a certain time of year. Here are five ways to boost your chances of conceiving quickly  along with tips for a healthy pregnancy and guidelines on when to be concerned about a fertility problem.Tip #1: See your healthcare providerYou can lay the groundwork for a healthy pregnancy even before you get pregnant. You're more likely to have a successful pregnancy when your body is up to the task. Schedule apreconception checkupwith a doctor or midwife to find out whether you're in your best baby-making shape  and to learn what changes may help.You may not be able to get an appointment right away or resolve any health issues immediately, but taking these steps as soon as possible can help you conceive more easily in the long run.Tip #2: Plan for a healthy pregnancyWhen you're trying to conceive, eat nutritious foods, maintain a healthy weight, get regular exercise, and try to kick any bad habits (like drinking, smoking, or using drugs). Limit your caffeine intake to less than 200 milligrams a day (about 12 ounces of coffee). Any more than that may contribute to fertility problems.At your preconception appointment, discuss any medications you're taking and find out if they'll be safe to use during pregnancy.You can dramatically reduce the risk of certain birth defects if youbegin taking folic acidat least one month before you start trying to conceive.Find out what else you can do ahead of time togive your baby a healthy start.Tip #3: Figure out when you ovulateThe biggest secret to getting pregnant quickly is knowing when you ovulate(release an egg from your ovary).You ovulate only once each menstrual cycle, and there are just a few days during that time when it's possible to conceive. Knowing when you ovulate means that you and your partner can time intercourse to have the best chance of getting pregnant that cycle.You can use a few different methods to figure out when you ovulate. Our article on predicting ovulation walks you through them. This ovulation calculator also does the math for you by determining when you're most likely to be fertile.(If you have irregular periods, pinpointing ovulation could be difficult. Ask your provider for advice.)Tip #4: Have sex at the right timeOnce you know the timeframe your egg is likely to be released from your ovary, you can plan to have sex during yourmost fertile days, which is usually about three days before ovulation through the day you ovulate.You have a range of days for baby-making sex because sperm can survive for three to six days in your body. (Your egg survives for only about a day.) That means if you have sex on Monday, sperm can survive in your fallopian tubes until Thursday  or even as late as Sunday.If you're not sure when your fertile period will be, just have sex every other day. This means you'll have healthy sperm in your fallopian tubes whenever your egg gets released.(If you want to have sex more often than every other day, that's fine. It won't improve your chances any more, butit won't hurt, either.)Another tip: If you and your partner are waiting to have sex until your most fertile time, make sure you haven't gone through too long of a dry spell beforehand. Your partner should ejaculate at least once in the days just before your most fertile period. Otherwise there could be a buildup of dead sperm in his semen.(Ed. note: Vaginal lubricants including saliva, olive oil, and most water-based lubricants can slow down sperm. Ask your provider to recommend one that's safe to use when trying to conceive. Canola oil can be a good alternative.)Tip #5: Give sperm a boostSperm have the best shot of fertilizing an egg when they're healthy, strong, and plentiful. Your partner can do several things to help:Cut back on alcohol. Studies show that drinking daily can lower testosterone levels and sperm counts, increasing the number of abnormal sperm.Skip tobacco and recreational drugs. These can cause poor sperm function.Try to maintain a healthy weight. Obesity can lower sperm count and slow down sperm.Get enough ofcertain key nutrients like zinc, folic acid, calcium, and vitamins C and D  that help create strong and plentiful sperm.Don't use hot tubs and saunas or take hot baths because heat kills sperm. (Testicles function best at 94 to 96 degrees Fahrenheit, a couple of degrees cooler than normal body temperature.)The sooner your partner can make these changes, the better: Sperm take a while to mature, so any improvements now will yield better sperm specimens about three months from now.How long to try before getting helpIf you're going to get pregnant naturally, it's very likely to happenwithin the first six months. About 8 out of 10 couples have conceived by then.After that, how long you should keep trying before youseek help from a fertility specialistdepends in large part on your age.Fertility declines as you get older, so if you're age 40 or older, get help from an expert right away. If you're 35 to 40, talk to a specialist after you've tried for six months with no luck. And if you're younger than 35, it's probably fine to keep trying for a year before seeking assistance.Of course, if you know of a reason you or your partner are more likely tohave a fertility problem, make an appointment right away.

Quick and healthy packed lunches,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-packed-lunches_66913.bc,"Follow these simple tips and suggestions for lunches that are yummy AND nutritious.Find out what your child really likesYou can pack a lunch full of healthy foods, but if your child doesn't like it, she won't eat it  period. Look for acceptable alternatives to food she doesn't like. If she won't eat apples, for example, try fruits like melon, oranges, kiwis, or persimmons  all of which have vitamin C and other fortifying substances.If you want to encourage her to try something different, tuck in new foods along with familiar favorites. Don't overdo it, though: Too many unfamiliar foods might put her off her lunch entirely.If your child is picky, try doing a taste test at home to select ""winners"" for her packed lunches. Set out a few vegetable options, for example, or types of dip and have her sample each to see which she likes best. Look for good options in the same food group: If she won't eat chicken, try turkey or tuna. Or if she won't drink milk try low-fat yogurt or cheese.Encourage your child to help make her lunchChildren who set their own menus are more likely to eat when lunchtime rolls around. Take your child shopping with you, and let him pick out fresh fruit, vegetables, and snacks. Invite him to help you pack his lunch and snacks.Preparing food together is a good opportunity to teach him about balanced meals. Check out the federal nutritional guidelines for children at ChooseMyPlate.gov for guidance.Be flexibleNot everything your child eats has to be packed with vitamins and minerals. Treats are fine. Just make sure you tuck at least two wholesome items into every lunch bag.Along with the main dish, add a piece of fruit, a box of raisins, or a handful of sliced carrots, edamame, or other vegetables. Include a container of water, low-fat milk, or 100 percent fruit juice.Reimagine the sandwichIf your child is tired of conventional sandwiches, ditch the bread and try pitas, tortillas, bagels, or even lettuce wraps.Try making pinwheel sandwiches. Spread low-fat mayonnaise, cream cheese, or creamy dressing on a tortilla or flatbread and add sandwich toppings. Roll up tightly and cut into slices.Or use a bento box to deconstruct the classic lunchbox sandwich. Place mini chicken sausages, rolled up lunch meats, cheese cubes, olives, pickles  whatever your child likes  in separate compartments.Another option is a bagel sandwich. Split a mini bagel (or half of a whole bagel), and layer sandwich toppings. Try an apple bagel sandwich with cheddar cheese, apple slices, and cinnamon. Or you could stir some jam into light cream cheese and spread it on a bagel or even toasted whole wheat waffles.Have dinner for lunchLast night's leftovers make an easy lunch. If your child devoured spaghetti tossed with olive oil and Parmesan cheese last night, she'll probably eat the leftovers the next day. You can freshen it up by adding a few meatballs, olives, or cooked vegetables.Mix leftover veggies with rice or pasta for a fast, ""new"" meal, or turn them into soup or stew. Roast chicken can be shredded and served with salad, soup, or noodles. Stir-fried vegetables get a fresh treatment rolled up in a whole wheat tortilla.Keep favorites freshUse your child's favorite foods to lead her to new tastes. If your child loves yogurt, for example, start with her favorite kind  vanilla is usually a hit  and then add low-fat granola or another crunchy cereal with a tablespoon or two of raisins or sunflower seeds. Stir everything together, or keep the crunchy mix-ins separate for your child to stir in at lunchtime.Try flavored yogurt as a dip with fruit, or freeze a low-fat yogurt tube and pack it in her lunch. (It will thaw by lunchtime.) For an extra protein boost, try substituting low- or nonfat Greek yogurt.Crunchy yogurtStart with your child's favorite yogurt  vanilla is usually a hit  then stir in half a cup of low-fat granola or another good-munching cereal. Add a tablespoon or two of raisins, chopped walnuts, peanuts, or sunflower seeds. You can seal it all in a plastic container or leave the yogurt in its carton and pack the mix-ins in a sandwich bag. (Don't forget to slip a spoon into the lunch bag.) For a special weekend lunch at home, serve crunchy yogurt with fresh melon or a sliced banana.Think smallOffer small portions of different foods. You can make a meal out of appetizers if they're healthy: grapes and strawberries, cherry tomatoes and chunks of low-fat cheese, cut-up melon, olives and chunks of cooked chicken, and firm tofu cubes are just a few options.Pack whole wheat crackers with deli meat, cheese slices, and vegetables. Tuck in a few quesadilla wedges, a hard-cooked egg, or a sampling of fruit and cheese.Offer hummus or low-fat ranch dressing and cut-up vegetables for dipping. Include familiar favorites  perhaps baby carrots and celery  and throw in a surprise, like jicama. She just might eat it!Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 2013a.

Carpal tunnel syndrome: How to get relief after the baby's born,https://www.babycenter.com/0_carpal-tunnel-syndrome-how-to-get-relief-after-the-babys-bor_1152205.bc,"I gave birth a few days ago, and the pain and numbness I had in my hands and fingers during pregnancy persists. When will it go away?It depends. The pain usually goes away gradually as the swelling from pregnancy subsides. If it persists even after the swelling resolves, you may need to wear a wrist splint or have a minor surgical procedure to correct the problem.What causes it?The pain and numbness starts during pregnancy when the carpal tunnel in your wrist swells. (The carpal tunnel is the tube that the nerves going to your fingers run through.) Although swelling has everything to do with being pregnant  lots of tissues in your body swell during pregnancy  and nothing to do with repetitive hand movements, the result is the same. Pressure from the swollen carpal tunnel causes numbness, tingling, burning, and pain in the fingers and, often, up the arm.What can I do to relieve the pain?Your provider may suggest cortisone injections to help relieve the pain (they're safe for breastfeeding moms), or wearing a wrist splint, a treatment that has proved useful to many with carpal tunnel syndrome.If the pain persists, discuss it with your healthcare provider at your six-week postpartum checkup. You may need a minor surgical procedure to relieve the pressure on the median nerve, which runs down your arm and into your hand. A small incision is made in your palm so the doctor can cut the transverse carpal ligament, which pushes into the median nerve as the carpal tunnel swells, preventing the nerve from functioning properly. Once the ligament cut is made, the pressure is alleviated, allowing the median nerve to do its job. The surgery is not painful but recovery can take between six and eight weeks.When should I call my healthcare provider?Consult your doctor or midwife if the pain and numbness interferes with your sleep or daily routine. Don't take any pain medications without consulting your healthcare provider first.Note: While you may have heard that taking a daily dose of vitamin B-6 can help, that's true only for those with a B-6 deficiency; if you're eating a healthy, balanced diet, you're getting the vitamins you need.Show sources Hide sources Ablove Rh, et al. 2009.

Look for whole wheat pita bread (unless she'll refuse to eat it). For the filling: Chop up half a cup of her favorite veggies  carrots, celery, cucumbers, or sweet peppers, for instance. Add a small handful of shredded cheese. Then stir it all together with mild salsa.Bagel bonanzaFor another great meal, spread a few dollops of light cream cheese on a whole grain bagel. If your child has a favorite jam or jelly, you might stir a little into the cream cheese for added flavor. If she likes tomatoes, lay a few slices over the cream cheese.Personal pizzasAlmost all kids love pizza. These mini-pies take only a few minutes to prepare. Slice an English muffin, spread a heaping tablespoon of spaghetti sauce on each piece, and sprinkle each with a tablespoon of cheese. If your kid is a vegetable lover (lucky you), put a few slices of her favorite veggie on top. Bake in the toaster oven until the cheese melts slightly.Crunchy yogurtStart with your child's favorite yogurt  vanilla is usually a hit  then stir in half a cup of low-fat granola or another good-munching cereal. Add a tablespoon or two of chopped fresh melon or a sliced banana."
Quick and healthy snacks for toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-snacks-for-toddlers_1186677.bc,"In just minutes, you can prepare nutritious snacks your toddler will love. And offering a broad variety of food helps him get the vitamins and minerals he needs. Remember to use full-fat dairy products for kids under 2, and choose whole grain breads and cereals.Here are a few quick, easy, and healthy snack suggestions:Fresh fruit. Nothing's better than fresh fruit: It's colorful, sweet and juicy, packed with vitamins and minerals, and full of fiber. Serve sliced apple, orange sections, half a sliced banana, or a small bowl of sliced grapes, or give your child a handful of mixed berries. Toddlers love finger food, making this an easy and fun way to enjoy a nutritious snack.Dried and pureed fruit. Cut up dried apricots, peaches, pears, and pitted prunes, or serve a small bowl of applesauce (the kind without added sugar).Dips. Your child is learning to feed himself so let him mix and dip his favorite foods. You might be surprised at the combinations your young one is willing to try  let him explore and have fun.Give him a couple of wedges of pita bread paired with a tablespoon or two of hummus or spinach dip. Strawberries and apple slices go well with creamy yogurt, and pretzels taste great with a variety of sweet and savory mustards.Cottage cheese. Serve in a small bowl topped with chopped fresh fruit, or mix in peas and carrots to make confetti cottage cheese.Eggs. Scrambled eggs take just a few minutes. Try adding turkey and cheese, or mix in salsa and wrap in a tortilla for a burrito. Make hard-cooked eggs on the weekend and store them in the fridge for weekday snacks.Mini-pizza. Toast half an English muffin and spread about a tablespoon of marinara sauce on it. Add some chopped vegetables and a tablespoon of shredded cheese and broil in the oven for a minute or two until the cheese melts.Parfait party. Layer a small bowl or dessert glass with one-third cup of vanilla yogurt, one-quarter cup of chopped fruit, and a few berries or banana slices. Sprinkle a little granola on the top.Mini quesadilla. Sprinkle half a small corn tortilla with a tablespoon of shredded cheese and microwave for 20 seconds. Fold in half and cut into small pieces. Serve with a small bowl of mild salsa for dipping.Mini waffles. Toast half a frozen waffle, cut into strips, and serve with yogurt for dipping and some fresh fruit.Vegetables. Get your toddler in the habit of snacking on vegetables. Fresh veggies like cooked, chopped carrots or green beans, roasted kale, and steamed broccoli or cauliflower are nutritious treats. Bake veggie ""chips"" with carrots, beets, or sweet potatoes.Mashed munchies. Your toddler's days of eating nothing but pureed foods are behind her, but there's still a place on her plate for foods that are easy to eat with a spoon. Try mashing up a bit of edamame, black beans, sweet potato, or avocado.Frozen fruit bars. The best of these frozen treats contain chunks of real fruit. You can buy them in the store or make them yourself with 100 percent juice and chopped, fresh fruit, or by freezing a smoothie. Try orange, pineapple, peach, and banana, to name a few. They're a great summer refresher (and especially fun for your child to help you make).Fruit juice. Make sure it's 100 percent fruit juice with no added sugar, and limit your child to no more than three-quarters of a cup daily. For a healthy, balanced snack, try a small glass of juice and a couple of crackers with a tablespoon of cream cheese or a thin layer of smooth peanut butter.Fruit shakes. Throw half a banana, one-quarter cup of milk, and a handful of berries in your blender, and you've got a nutritious shake. Add yogurt for more flavor, protein, and calcium. For the best consistency, use frozen fruit.Orange freeze. Blend half a peeled orange with a cup of ice in a blender. Adjust the flavor with a little sweetener.Get more tips for healthy snacks and meals."
What eating for two really means,https://www.babycenter.com/eating-for-two,"Can I really eat twice as much now that I'm pregnant?No. You may sometimes be tempted to eat twice as much, but that's not what the doctor ordered.Your body becomes more efficient during pregnancy and is able to absorb more of the nutrients you eat. So consuming twice as much doesn't double your chances of having a healthy baby  instead, it's likely to mean excessive weight gain for you, which can put you at risk for pregnancy complications.While guidelines vary, the Institute of Medicine says if you're a healthy weight, you need no additional calories in the first trimester, 340 extra calories a day in the second trimester, and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're overweight or underweight, you'll need more or less than this depending on your weight gain goal.It takes only a couple of glasses of low-fat milk and a handful of sunflower seeds or a tuna sandwich to add enough calories for that last trimester. (But you'll need to eat more if you're having more than one baby.)Pregnancy Safety QuestionsOur experts answer your most pressing questions about what is and isn't safe during pregnancy.How can I get all the nutrients I need without eating a lot more calories?Here are some tips for maximizing nutrition during pregnancy:Plan meals and snacks based on the requirements outlined in the USDA Choose My Plate site for pregnant woman or another reliable source, like the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate. Learn more about meal planning for pregnancy.To meet your daily needs for protein, calories, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and key vitamins and minerals during pregnancy, eat a variety of foods. Even within a category of foods (like vegetables), look for different colors, types, and textures, for example.Try to minimize ""extra"" foods that have calories but few nutrients  sugary beverages, fried foods, foods with extra fat and sugar. Instead, choose meals and snacks that pack the most nutrition per calorie. Adding a few nutrition-packed snacks  like yogurt, nuts, a hard-boiled egg, some fresh fruits or vegetables  to your daily intake is a great way to get the healthy calories your baby needs.Choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. Pick whole-grain bread or brown rice over refined white bread or white rice, and fresh fruits or frozen unsweetened fruit over canned fruits in sugar syrup, for example.Eat fats, oils, and sweets sparingly. And be sure to choose healthy fats. Can't overcome your cravings for junk food? Discover some healthy  and delicious  alternatives.How is the food I eat divided between my needs and my baby's?Doctors don't understand exactly how you and your growing baby divvy up nutrients. Sustenance for your child comes from your diet and from the nutrients already stored in your bones and tissues.In the past, a developing fetus was thought of as a ""perfect parasite,"" taking all the necessary nourishment from the mother, regardless of her diet. This myth maintained that if your diet was deficient in, say, vitamin C, it didn't matter as far as the baby was concerned, because he could simply siphon the nutrient from you.Experts now believe that it's the growing baby who suffers if the mother's diet is lacking. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is thought to have lifelong effects on a baby's health.In a nutshell: Your baby's health and growth are directly related to what you eat before and during your pregnancy.What you eat is important. And when you're tempted to overdo it, remember that you're eating for a baby, not another full-size adult. Choose quality over quantity!Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2009.

Pregnant with multiples: Nutrition and fitness needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-with-multiples-nutrition-and-fitness-needs_3580.bc,"Do I need to eat more if I'm pregnant with multiples?Yes. If you're pregnant with multiples, you need more calories than a woman who's carrying just one baby.A general guideline is to add 300 calories a day for each baby. So if you're carrying twins, you'd add roughly 600 calories to your usual diet. This amount may be different if you were overweight or underweight before you got pregnant, so talk with your provider to come up with an eating plan that has the number of calories that's appropriate for you.Whether you're carrying twins, triplets, or more, plan to eatat least five times a day(three meals and two substantial snacks), even if you don't feel especially hungry.Of course,not all calories are created equal. Make each one count by limiting sugar and eating a variety of foodspacked with the nutrients you need, including protein, carbohydrates, andfats. Cheese, milk, meat, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils all fuel your babies' growth. Round out your diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.How much weight should I gain if I'm pregnant with multiples?Gaining the right amount of weight is necessary to nourish your growing babies. Try to put on pounds starting early in the pregnancy  when your babies are developing rapidly and you still have room to fill your stomach. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends the following weight gain ranges for women carrying twins based on their pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI):37 to 54 pounds if you started at a normal weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9)31 to 50 pounds if you were overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9)25 to 42 pounds if you were obese (BMI of 30 or higher)According to the IOM, there isn't enough data to make weight gain recommendations for women pregnant with triplets or more. If you're expecting three or more babies, ask your provider for a weight gain target that's right for you.If you were underweight before pregnancy, you'll have to put on extra weight quickly to catch up. Your provider can help you set healthy weight goals throughout your pregnancy. Live birth: TwinsFollow one woman through her pregnancy with twins and watch her give birth.Will I need to take a special kind of prenatal vitamin?Prenatal vitamins are important, but you don't need a special formula for twins and triplets. A standardprenatal supplementwill do just fine.A supplement is the best way to ensure that you get vital nutrients such as folic acid,iron, andcalcium. Your provider can recommend specific brands and doses.Women carrying more than one baby are at a higher risk foriron-deficiency anemiaduring pregnancy. Your provider will monitor your iron level to make sure you're getting enough. If you're not, she may recommend that you take an iron supplement.High doses of iron can sometimes lead to constipation andnausea, so talk to your provider about ways to avoid these problems.How much water do I need if I'm pregnant with multiples?Even if you're the type of person who never goes anywhere without a water bottle, pay extra attention to how much water you're drinking now that you're carrying multiples. Women who are pregnant with one baby are advised to drink 10 8-ounce cups of water (or other hydrating beverages) each day, so that's probably a good starting point for you too.But every woman is different  you may need a little more or less water than someone else. Ask your provider for specific advice on fluid intake.Of course, drinking extra fluids means you'll be making extra trips to the bathroom (especially as your babies grow larger), but you can use this as a chance to check if you're hydrated. Aim to drink enough water to keep your urine clear or pale yellow. If it's cloudy or dark yellow, drink more.It's especially important to prevent dehydration in the second half of pregnancy because having multiples can raise the risk ofpremature labor and early delivery.Can I exercise if I'm pregnant with multiples?If you're a healthy, active woman with multiples on the way, you can probably continue to exercise during your pregnancy, as long as your provider gives you the go-ahead.Keep it slow, relaxed, and gentle. Your body  and your babies  may not be able to handle intense workouts. Good options includeswimming,walking, andprenatal yoga.Be sure you're hydrated before, during, and after your workout. And no matter what exercise you enjoy, stop immediately if you develop signs of overheating, such as nausea, dizziness, or a racing heart.That said, carrying more than one baby is a workout in itself, and some women may need to commit to extra rest or avoid doing certain types of exercise. For example, aerobic exercise may be off-limits if you're at risk of delivering your baby early.Discuss your workout routine with your provider to make sure you and your baby stay healthy during your pregnancy, and be sure to tell your provider if you develop signs of preterm labor, such as abdominal pain or bleeding. Preterm labor is a reason for you to stop exercising altogether.Learn more:Pregnant with multiples: Prenatal careTwins fetal development month by monthNational Organization of Mothers of Twins ClubsShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

But it doesn't matter whether she's in the 5th or the 95th percentile, as long as her rate of growth is steady from one visit to the next.Do a complete physicalHeart and lungs: Uses a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems.Eyes: Checks for signs of congenital eye conditions and other problems. May also check for blocked tear ducts and discharge.Ears: Looks for signs ofinfectionand observes how your baby responds to sound.Mouth: Looks for signs ofthrush(an oral yeast infection) among other things.Head: Checks the soft spots (fontanels) and the shape of your baby's head. Also checks to see if your baby's head isdeveloping a flat spot (now's the time to catch it).Body: Checks your baby's reflexes and muscle tone, and examines the skin for rashes.Belly: Presses gently on the abdomen to check for a hernia or any enlarged organs.Genitals: Opens your baby's diaper and checks for signs of infection.Hips and legs: Moves your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Give your baby her shotsYour baby will receive thepneumococcal,DTaP,Hib, andpoliovaccines (combined in two shots) and therotavirusvaccine (given orally). She'll also get the secondhepatitis Bnow if she didn't get it at the 1-month checkup.An assistant may administer the vaccines. This is usually done at the end of the appointment so you can have some privacy afterward to comfort your baby.Address any other concernsYour doctor will recommend givingvitamin Ddrops to breastfed babies. (Babies who drink 17 to 32 ounces of formula a day are getting enough vitamin D.)The doctor will also address any health concerns (such asreflux,baby acne, anddiaper rash), ask you some questions (see below), and help you understand what's normal at this age.Questions the doctor may ask:How is your baby sleeping?At this age, many babies are starting to sleep a little longer at night  maybe even staying asleep for a 4- or 5-hour stretch  and less during the day. They're still snoozing 14 to 16 hours a day on average.When, how, and how often is your baby eating?Most 2-month-olds still eat every two to three hours, though they may begin to eat slightly less often later this month. The doctor asksfeedingquestions to determine whether your baby is getting enoughbreast milkorformulato thrive.What are your baby's bowel movements like?Soft feces are best, but color can vary. Dry or pellet-like stools are a sign ofdehydration, or a sign ofconstipation. Tell your doctor if you notice this.What is your baby's crying pattern?If your baby is particularly fussy orcolicky, the doctor may suggestways to soothe him. Have you noticed a change? Many babies begin to ""settle"" at about 8 weeks.How's your baby's head control?Head controlis an important developmental milestone. By now your baby should be able to hold his head up when he's on his stomach.Can your baby push up on his forearms?This development in your baby's strength and coordination, which could happen this month or next, is the precursor to themini-pushuphe'll master at about 4 months.How does your baby respond when you talk to him?At this age, your baby should be cooing on his own and at you  it's one of the first steps in hislanguage development.Does your baby smile?Most babies are smiling voluntarily by this age  it's one of their earliest social behaviors.Have you noticed anything unusual about your baby's eyes or the way he looks at things?At every well-baby visit, the doctor shouldcheck the structure and alignment of the eyesand your baby's ability to move them correctly.How's your baby's hearing?Hearingis mature from birth, so if your baby's not turning toward voices, especially familiar ones, tell the doctor.What's your baby's posture like?By now your baby should have relaxed a bit from the scrunched-up fetal position. His legs should come down when he's lying on his back. But if he's overly limp  he feels like he'll slip out of your arms  or has uneven movements, tell your doctor.Are you giving your baby tummy time when he's awake?Supervisedtummy time when your child is awake and active  helps babies learn to push up,roll over, and eventuallycrawl. It also helps them avoid getting aflat spot on the back of the head.What's next?Find out what's in store at the4-month doctor visit.Show sources Hide sources Mayo Clinic. Undated.

Presses gently on the abdomen to check for a hernia or any enlarged organs.Genitals: Opens your baby's diaper and checks for signs of infection. If your baby is a boy, the doctor looks to see if his testes have descended into the scrotum. If your son was circumcised, the doctor examines his penis to make sure it's healing well.Hips and legs: Moves your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Give your baby his shotsYour baby will probably get a hepatitis B shot. Most babies receive their first hep B shot a birth, the second at their 1 or 2 month checkup, and their third sometime between 6 and 18 months.An assistant may administer the shot. It's usually done at the end of the appointment so you can have some privacy afterward to comfort your baby.Address any other concernsYour doctor will recommend giving vitamin D drops to breastfed babies. (Babies who drink 17 to 32 ounces of formula a day are getting enough vitamin D.)The doctor will also address any noticeable health concerns (diaper rash and cradle cap are common at this stage), ask you some questions (see below), and help you understand what's normal at this age.Questions the doctor may ask:How is your baby sleeping? Normal sleeping patterns are still erratic this month, but most babies will sleep in two- to three-hour chunks during the day and night for a total of about 15 hours. By now one period of sleep may be a little longer than the others  that's the first step toward a full night's rest for the baby and you.What position does your baby sleep in? To reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), put your baby to sleep on her back.When, how, and how often is your baby eating? Most 1-month-olds eat every two to three hours. The doctor asks these questions to determine whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula to thrive, and to see if you have any concerns about feeding.What are your baby's bowel movements like? Soft feces are best, but color can vary. Dry or pellet-like stools are a sign of dehydration, or a sign of constipation in a formula-fed infant. Tell your doctor if you notice this.Does your baby quiet down, at least briefly, at the sound of your voice? This behavior tells you and the doctor two things: Your baby is beginning to recognize you, and she sees you as a source of comfort and nurturing.Is your baby awake for longer periods of time? There's no right amount of alert time, but a general trend toward longer periods of alertness is a sign that your baby's developing normally.Does she make soft cooing noises when she's content and alert? It's still several months before she'll utter her first real words, but these happy baby sounds are the first step.Have you noticed anything unusual about your baby's eyes or the way she looks at things? At every well-baby visit, the doctor should check the structure and alignment of the eyes and your baby's ability to move them correctly.Is she a little fussier at the end of the day? It's normal for 1-month-olds to fuss in the evening, especially between 6 p.m. and midnight. As your baby starts staying awake for longer periods during the day, she'll begin feeling more tired and irritable at night.Are you giving your baby tummy time when she's awake? Start tummy time from day one  when your child is awake and you're watching her, of course. Time on the tummy helps babies learn to push up, roll over, and eventually crawl. It also helps them avoid getting a flat spot on the back of the head. If you start it right away, your baby is less likely to resist it.Does your baby hold her head up when placed on her tummy? Head control is an important developmental milestone. If your baby can't hold her head up at least briefly by now, tell the doctor.How are you doing? Your child's doctor will screen you for signs of postpartum depression and ask questions about stressors on your family and how much of a support network you have.What's next?Find out what's in store for you at the 2-month doctor visit.View and print a clean copy of the 1-month doctor visit worksheet."
Sleep problem: Restless legs syndrome during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-problem-restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy_7549.bc,"What it isIf you feel an uncontrollable urge to move your legs to relieve crawling, tingling, or burning sensations, you probably have restless legs syndrome (RLS).You're not alone. One study of more than 600 pregnant women found that over 16 percent reported symptoms of RLS.At the end of your rope? Need sleep? Find practical ideas that might work for you here: Coping with restless legs syndrome: Pregnancy advice from moms-to-be.Symptoms usually show up when you're at rest, especially right before you fall asleep or when you've been sitting still for long periods, such as at the movies or during a long car ride. Most of the time, you'll feel the symptoms of RLS in your lower legs, but some women feel it in their feet, thighs, arms, or hands, too.Moving your limbs brings immediate relief, but the sensations return when you stop moving. Needless to say, this can be very uncomfortable and frustrating, especially when you're trying to sleep. If RLS keeps you from sleeping night after night, you could end up seriously fatigued.Fortunately for women who develop RLS during pregnancy, it's temporary. The symptoms typically peak when you're 7 or 8 months pregnant and disappear altogether by the time you deliver your baby or within a month afterward.What causes restless legs syndromeNo single cause has been identified, but research is ongoing. In addition to affecting a good number of pregnant women, RLS affects men, children, and women who aren't pregnant. And it seems to run in families. For women who already have RLS, it usually gets worse during pregnancy.No one knows why women who've never had RLS develop it during pregnancy, but there are a number of theories. Iron deficiency, folate deficiency, hormonal changes (specifically a rise in estrogen), and circulatory changes are all possible culprits.What you can do about restless legs syndromeThings to avoidMost drugs used to treat RLS are not recommended during pregnancy.Quinine (found in tonic water) is sometimes used to relieve RLS symptoms, but don't take it without talking with your healthcare provider first. Its safety during pregnancy hasn't been established.Even a small amount of caffeine can make RLS symptoms worse. If RLS symptoms are bothering you, you might try eliminating caffeine from your diet completely, if you haven't already.Some medications, such as the antihistamines in cold and allergy remedies, make the symptoms worse for some people. (So while Benadryl tends to make people sleepy, for example, it may actually intensify your RLS symptoms and make it harder for you to sleep.)Lying in bed reading or watching television before you go to sleep can make things worse. The longer you lie still, the more likely RLS will occur. Instead, get in bed only when you're actually ready to go to sleep.Things that might helpAsk your doctor or midwife about trying supplements such as iron, magnesium, vitamin B12, or folate. Depending on the quantities in your prenatal vitamin, your practitioner may or may not want you to take more.Some women find it helpful to stretch their legs, get a massage, use hot or cold packs, take warm baths, or practice relaxation techniques. Maybe your significant other will massage or rub your legs until you fall asleep. For lots more tips from moms-to-be, read our article about coping with restless legs syndrome."
Feeding problems: Food jags,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-food-jags_9196.bc,"The problemIt's not uncommon for young children to go through a period of days, even weeks, when they'll eat only one or two foods. Part of the reason is that kids gravitate toward familiar foods. But demanding macaroni and cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is also a way for them to assert their independence, says Olivia Bennett Wood, associate professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue University in Indiana.What you can do""The less you make of it the better,"" says Wood. No child is going to become malnourished from eating macaroni and cheese for a week. In the meantime, be patient and keep offering a variety of healthy foods without pressuring your child to eat.If your child is old enough, here are additional strategies for getting her excited about eating a more varied diet:Take her to the supermarket with you and allow her to select two fruits, two vegetables, one snack, a box of cereal, and so on. At home, have her help you prepare foods.A 3-year-old can assist with mixing batter, cleaning fruits and vegetables, and tearing up lettuce leaves. Chances are she'll be proud of her accomplishment and more likely to want to eat the finished product.Vitamins are definitely not a substitute for nutritious food. But depending on how long the food jag goes on and how limited your child's diet is in the long run, it may make sense to give her a daily multivitamin.Talk to the doctor about it first, and if vitamins are recommended, ask which formulation is appropriate for your child's age."
Whipped cauliflower,https://www.babycenter.com/0_whipped-cauliflower_10411827.bc,"It may look like a mound of mashed potatoes, but this cauliflower whip is a healthier alternative. Cauliflower is an excellent source of dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins, especially vitamin C. Plus, it's fluffy and delicious  especially with a pat of butter melted throughout.This recipe is intended for babies 8 months and up.Ingredients2 cups (4 oz/125 g) cauliflower florets1 tablespoon unsalted butterPreparationIn a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to a boil. Place the cauliflower in a steamer basket and set over the water, then cover the pan.

Add the butter and puree in a blender or food processor until the texture is right for your baby. To make it thinner, add a little cooking liquid.Refrigerate the puree in an airtight container for up to three days, or freeze for up to three months.

BabyCenter® Cost of Raising a Child Study,https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-174-cost-of-raising-a-child-study_10415075.bc,"Parents Are Overspending on Their Children and Relying on Their Own Parents for Financial Support(San Francisco) - October 14, 2013 - BabyCenter.com, the #1 pregnancy and parenting mobile and web destination worldwide, today released its 2013 U.S. Cost of Raising a Child report, which examines the rising cost of having a baby. More than 1,200 BabyCenter.com moms completed the survey which found that parents spend an average of $13,000 per year on their kids. So it's no surprise that 66 percent of moms feel that parents spend too much on their kids  a 22 percent increase since 2012  and couples are worried about having enough money to start a family.""Children are expensive, but couples aren't letting that hold them back from starting a family,"" says Carmen Wong Ulrich, a BabyCenter.com financial expert. They are exploring ways of saving that they may not have previously considered, like moving back in with their parents or accepting money from in-laws. This can be a good short-term solution for couples to get them started, but they need to make sure they are taking the necessary steps to eventually become financially independent.All in the familyExpectant moms would like to save at least $4,500 before their baby is born, and some are turning to their parents for help. In fact, 10 percent of moms admit to living with their parents to save money in order to start a family. And the family support doesn't stop once the baby is born  nearly 30 percent of moms said they received financial help from their parents or in-laws during the babys first year.""Budgeting for baby is one the biggest challenges new parents face,"" said Wong Ulrich. ""A new baby can drastically alter a family's financial status, and parents need to be prepared."" A budget tool such as BabyCenter.com's Cost Calculator is a great way for new parents to get insight into their finances and start planning for independence.Getting pregnant isnt cheapToday it's not only raising a child that saps parents' wallets  even getting pregnant is a huge expense. Close to 50 percent of moms are spending money on products or services to encourage pregnancy, and it's adding up fast. From ovulation kits to vitamin supplements, women trying to get pregnant spend close to $500 to help them conceive.""It can take couples up to six months to conceive and all those prenatal vitamins, ovulation kits, and fertility tests can be costly,"" said Wong Ulrich. ""We also have to take into account that some couples need fertility treatment such as IVF or other medical interventions. The average cost of assisted reproductive techniques is $12,400 for a single try, which can be a real budget buster.""The Affordable Care Act is bringing big changes. BabyCenter answers moms' biggest questions about this legislation as well as helps moms figure out which essential items are now covered and how to get insured.Planning for maternity leaveHalf of BabyCenter's expectant moms say they plan to take three months off for maternity leave, and nearly 80 percent of them would take a longer maternity leave if they could. Though dads would like to have paternity leave, few get significant time off for it, and nearly 40 percent head back to work after just one week.""Since paid maternity leave is rare, most new moms end up using a combination of short-term disability, sick leave, personal days, and unpaid family leave to take time off from work to care for their newborn, which takes a chunk out of the cash flow,"" said Wong Ulrich. ""To ease financial concerns during this time, parents should aim to save up at least three months pay ahead of time. This will offset the paycheck that wont be coming in and provide a cushion in case of any emergencies.""Most families are feeling optimisticThough moving home and getting financial support from their parents may not be their ideal, the vast majority of moms are very optimistic about their future. Nearly 70 percent say they will be able to provide more for their children than they had growing up and the number of moms worried about having enough money to raise their children has declined approximately 10 percent in the last year.Analyzing family spending: Where is the money going?Parents admit to spending nearly $13,000 each year on their children, but where exactly is the money going? ""Housing accounts for a large percentage of parents' annual expenditure,"" says Wong Ulrich. ""Whether parents plan to renovate a room, expand their home, or move to a larger house, housing takes a big chunk of parents' wallets.""Childcare is another big drain on parents' bank accounts, especially working parents who need to arrange for daycare and after-school care. The remaining funds are allocated for transportation, food, entertainment, healthcare, and clothing.For more information on BabyCenter's 2013 U.S. Cost of Raising a Child report, please visit http://www.babycenter.com/child-cost. ###About BabyCenter LLCBabyCenter is the worlds partner in parenting.

High-risk moms-to-be say: Coping with sickle cell disease,https://www.babycenter.com/0_high-risk-moms-to-be-say-coping-with-sickle-cell-disease_10419354.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHaving sickle cell disease and being pregnant can make you feel a range of emotions. Below are tips, advice, and wise words from women in BabyCenter's Community who've been there, coping with sickle cell disease during pregnancy.Body and mind""I have sickle cell, and I'm in 'preconception' mode. I've started taking prenatal vitamins and folic acid. I see a high-risk doctor for preconception appointments as well as my hematologist every six months and a primary care provider. I'm feeling nervous, but I hope this helps."" DanaStarss""Morning sickness is the worst because it can bring on a pain crisis. My best advice is to stay hydrated as much as possible. It has been my biggest challenge through both of my pregnancies. But I keep reminding myself of the consequences [if I don't follow through]."" mamabella12""My best tips are to get a good prenatal vitamin, take your folate every day, eat as healthy as you can, and drink lots of water. Ask questions at your [hematology and gynecology] checkups too."" Mamamojo1013""I'm juicing lots of fruits and veggies on the days I can manage to drink them. It's not easy with nausea, but I do it as much as I can. Even my hematologist has noticed an improvement in my blood work."" mamabella12""Rest and keep your stress levels low. Read as much as you can about your condition, and make sure you take folic acid  it's necessary for blood building in sickle cell and for preventing birth defects."" LaBellaBre""I have had four bad pain crises during this pregnancy, but I have been fine for a while now. Drink lots of water, rest when you can, eat the right foods, take safe pain meds if you need them, and keep your stress levels as low as possible. I wish you the best for a healthy delivery! You can do it!"" KatieKat214Taking doctors' advice""It's definitely possible to have a successful pregnancy with a chronic illness. The most important thing to do is to see your hematologist regularly, even if you didn't see her often before your pregnancy. You also need a high-risk doctor because a midwife or regular doctor alone isn't equipped to deal with the issues you may face. "" DeeDah13""I was tired all the time and had to have several units of blood with both pregnancies, due to low blood counts. When I had pain crises, the doctors gave me narcotics in the hospital, and I took pills at home for basic pain management. Both of my children inherited the trait from me but are otherwise completely healthy. Neither had any complications after birth."" LaBellaBre""I had pain crises several times because I didn't take my meds out of fear of harming my baby, but that [actually] put him at risk.I let my pain get bad enough to be admitted [to the hospital] with dehydration and a high heart rate. The docs told me the stress I put on my body also put stress on my baby. The pain medicine helped me much more than it hurt either of us (though it did make my baby a little sleepy)."" KatieKat214Managing labor""I take oxycodone (a narcotic) when I have a pain crisis, but I haven't had to take it very often so far during my pregnancy. Thankfully, all is well with me and I'm 17 weeks along. I had a vaginal birth in my previous pregnancy and considering I had to be induced, everything went far better than the scenario I had imagined."" GraceCherry2""I have sickle cell and I had a vaginal birth. Labor pain was manageable, and it helped to be able to move around my room or go for a walk. Nothing like a sickle cell crisis at all!"" myblesssingmiaBeing resilient""I have SCD, and I'm 23 years old and 6 weeks pregnant. My younger brother has sickle cell too. We had pain episodes once in a while, had to monitor our health more closely than other kids, and knew we'd never be star athletes but that wasn't [so bad]. With good medical care we've had fulfilling lives."" Yogamom91""My older sister was born with sickle cell anemia. I was born without the disease but with the trait. Let me tell you this: My sister is 35 and living a wonderful life. Occasionally, she doesn't feel good, but I swear if she didn't say she had this disease, no one would know. She's pretty healthy and always happy, successful in her career, and has two children who don't have the disease. People with this disease can and do live full and fairly normal lives!""

Thiamin in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_thiamin-in-your-pregnancy-diet_668.bc,"Why you need thiamin during pregnancyThiamin (also known as thiamine or vitamin B1) enables you  and your baby  to convert carbohydrates into energy. It also helps your nervous system, muscles, and heart function normally and is essential for your baby's brain development.How much thiamin you needPregnant and breastfeeding women: 1.4 milligrams (mg) per dayNonpregnant women: 1.1 mg per dayFood sources of thiaminFortified breads, cereals, whole grain products, lean pork, dried beans, and peas all contain good amounts of thiamin. Fruits, vegetables, and dairy products have small amounts too. Here's a look at the amount of thiamin in some of these foods:1 cup plain wheat germ cereal, toasted: 1.88 mg3 ounces lean pork tenderloin: 0.81 mg1 cup fortified puffed wheat cereal: 0.31 mg1 cup enriched white rice, cooked: 0.26 mgone slice enriched white bread: 0.23 mg1/2 cup green peas, cooked: 0.21mg1 cup brown rice, cooked: 0.19 mg1 ounce pecans: 0.19 mg1/2 cup lentils, cooked: 0.17 mgone medium orange: 0.11 mg1/2 cantaloupe: 0.11 mg1 cup milk: 0.1 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 0.1 mg1/2 cup spinach, cooked 0.09 mgone large egg, hard boiled: 0.03 mg(Note that 3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a supplement?Chances are you'll get enough thiamin by eating foods like whole grain breads and vitamin-fortified cereals, but if you don't, a good multivitamin or prenatal supplement will ensure that you get the recommended amount.Thiamin deficiencies are rare in the United States, so you probably don't need to worry about not getting enough. Deficiencies are most common in developing countries where people's diets consist mainly of white rice. Thiamin is contained in the outer coating of rice, which is usually removed in processing. (That's why you'll often see white rice that's enriched with thiamin.) In industrialized countries, alcoholism is the main cause of thiamin deficiency. Alcohol makes it hard for the body to absorb thiamin.What are the signs of a thiamin deficiency?Early signs include weakness, nausea, and fatigue. Severe deficiency, also called beriberi, causes difficulty walking, loss of feeling in hands and feet, loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs, mental confusion, speech difficulties, increased heart rate, and shortness of breath with activity.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Phosphorus in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_phosphorus-in-your-pregnancy-diet_676.bc,"Why you need phosphorus during pregnancyPhosphorus is a mineral that helps build strong bones in you and your developing baby. (About 85 percent of all the phosphorus in your body is found in your bones.)This mineral is also important for muscle contractions, blood clotting, kidney function, nerve conduction, tissue and cell repair, and normal heart rhythm. Phosphorus helps the body generate and use energy.How much phosphorus you needWomen age 19 and older: 700 milligrams (mg) per dayWomen age 18 and younger: 1,250 mg per dayPhosphorus needs are the same for all women throughout adulthood  whether or not you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Food sources of phosphorusHere are some good food sources of phosphorus:3 ounces Chinook salmon, cooked: 315 mg1 cup plain, nonfat yogurt: 306 mg1 cup nonfat milk: 247 mg3 ounces halibut, cooked: 244 mg3 ounces light turkey meat, cooked: 217 mg3 ounces chuck steak, cooked : 179 mg1/2 cup lentils, cooked: 178 mg1 ounce almonds: 136 mg1 ounce part-skim mozzarella cheese: 131 mg1 ounce peanuts: 108 mgone large egg, hard boiled: 86 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 68 mg(Note that 3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a supplement?No, you can easily get all the phosphorus you need from a well-balanced diet (even though most prenatal vitamins don't contain phosphorus). For example, 1 cup of yogurt provides nearly half of your phosphorus for the day.In order for your body to absorb phosphorus properly, it must be balanced withcalciumand combined with vitamin D  that's why dairy products are such a good source of this mineral.Phosphorus deficiencies are very rare and usually seen only in cases of starvation. Signs include weakness, anemia, loss of appetite, and loss of bone mass.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Grains in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_grains-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1497.bc,"Why grains are so importantGrains (including whole wheat, oats, barley, corn, and rice, to name a few) are packed with nutrients such asiron, selenium, andmagnesium. They're also especially good sources of the B vitamins (including B1, B2,folic acid, and niacin) your growing baby needs for just about every part of his body. Grains supply energy for your baby's development and help the placenta grow.Be sure to look for ""whole grains,"" like whole wheat bread and brown rice, for example. These contain the most vitamins and nutrients. Most whole grains have plenty of fiber, too. The recommended amount of fiber during pregnancy is 28 grams a day, which helps prevent constipationandhemorrhoids.Government guidelines recommend that you make at least half the grains you eat each day whole grains. Products labeled ""refined""or ""enriched""aren't as beneficial to you or your baby.A note on shopping for whole grains: Many products now carry a label stating how many grams of whole grains it contains, and some have a whole grain stamp. If you don't see a label or a stamp, check the ingredients label. Whole grains are listed first.Some good grain choicesHere are some good grain options. Each is equal to one serving:1/2 cup cooked wheat, oatmeal, or barley cereal1 cup ready-to-eat whole grain cereal1.25-inch-square piece of cornbread1/2 whole wheat raisin or plain bagelOne slice of whole wheat bread1/2 whole grain hamburger or hot dog bun1/2 whole grain English muffin1/2 whole wheat pita pocket (6 inches across)1/2 cup cooked brown rice or wild rice1/2 cup cooked grain, such as millet, bulgur, or barleyTwo rice cakes1/2 cup cooked whole wheat noodles or pastaOne corn or whole wheat tortilla (6 inches across)One whole grain waffle or pancake (4 1/2 inches across)3 cups popcornEasy ways to add more grains to your daily dietTry a variety of grains for your morning cereal. Millet, oatmeal, and wheat all make good hot breakfasts.Substitute air-popped popcorn or whole grain crackers for chips.Experiment with whole grain noodles and pastas. Japanese soba noodles, for example, are made from buckwheat.Add cooked barley or another whole grain to quick breads, pancake or waffle batter, and soups. You can also shape them into patties and fry or bake them.Use leftover whole grains to make side salads. Simply add chopped veggies and a vinaigrette dressing.Replace some of the flour in your baked goods with whole grain flour, such as whole wheat, teff, triticale, spelt, or rye.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Dairy products in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dairy-products-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1727.bc,"The benefits of eating dairy products during pregnancyDairy products are excellent sources ofcalcium,protein,vitamin D, phosphorus, and other essential vitamins and minerals. These nutrients are important for your baby's developing bones, teeth, muscles, heart, and nerves, and for blood clotting.How much dairy do I need during pregnancy?Aim to eat three to four servings of calcium-rich foods a day, enough to give you 1,000 milligrams (mg) of calcium.You can get all the nutrients you need from nonfat and low-fat dairy products and fortified soy milk. Which you choose may depend on whether you're overweight, right on target, orunderweightduring your pregnancy.

If you're not a big breakfast eater, just drink a glass of milk.When you need a midafternoon boost, treat yourself to a decaf latte, hot chocolate, or cup of steamed milk. If you make hot chocolate with a powdered mix, use milk instead of water to boost the calcium content. (Some brands don't contain a significant amount of milk.)Use evaporated milk, which has double the calcium of regular milk, in cooked dishes like mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, cheese sauces and fruit smoothies, puddings, and custards.Make a yogurt dip for fresh vegetables.Top casseroles and soups with shredded cheese.Note: To avoid the bacterial infection listeriosis, stay away from unpasteurized milk and all foods made with it, such as soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheese.Can I eat dairy products even if I'm lactose intolerant?Even if you're lactose intolerant, you probably don't need to give up all dairy products. Research shows that most people who have trouble digesting lactose (the sugar in milk) can tolerate at least 1 cup of milk at mealtimes.Here are five ways to include dairy in your diet if you're lactose intolerant. (Be sure to check out this list of othergood sources of calcium.)Drink lactose-reduced milk or add over-the-counter enzyme drops (which help break down the lactose) to your milk. You can also take enzyme supplements (lactase) to help you digest the lactose more easily. (Be sure to check with your doctor or midwife before taking lactase or any other supplements.)Divide it up. Have 1/2 cup of milk (especially whole or 2 percent) four times a day with meals or snacks. The fat in the milk slows down digestion, making the lactose easier to digest.Drink milk with food. It's easier to digest when mixed with other foods, especially high-fiber foods.Choose low-fat or hard, aged cheese. More than half the lactose is removed from low-fat cheese during processing. Hard, aged cheeses have the lowest lactose content.Eat yogurt. This can be a great alternative to milk. Yogurt also contains active cultures, which are beneficial bacteria that help you digest lactose.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

A diagnostic test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may also be offered  this is generally done at 11 to 12 weeks. Or you may consider waiting until your second trimester for amniocentesis.Find out more about prenatal testing.Learn the signs of a pregnancy problemSo many aches, pains, and strange feelings arise during pregnancy that it can be hard to decide what's normal and what's not. To complicate matters further, some symptoms may be more or less problematic depending on your particular situation or health history and on how far along you are in your pregnancy.Here's a rundown of symptoms that could be a sign of a problem. If you have any of these complaints, call your doctor or midwife immediately.Think about when and how you'll announce your pregnancySome women spill the beans to friends, family, and co-workers right away. Others wait until they're in their second trimester, when their pregnancy is well established and the risk of miscarriage has declined significantly. But if you're having morning sickness or pregnancy complications, or if your job is strenuous or potentially dangerous, you may have to tell folks (like your supervisor) sooner than you'd planned.Find out more about announcing your pregnancy at work and check out these creative ways to share your wonderful news.Follow your baby's developmentSign up for BabyCenter's free email newsletters and each week you'll learn exactly what's going on with both your pregnancy and your baby.Join your Birth ClubNobody understands what you're going through as well as other expecting moms in the same stage of pregnancy. Connect with women due the same month as you in your BabyCenter Birth Club.Start taking belly photosHave someone take a picture of you every week, or take your own picture using your reflection in a mirror. It's a great way to see your progress, and you'll love having the keepsake.Tips for a great shot: Consider wearing the same outfit, standing in the same spot, and striking the same pose (profiles work best) for each photo.For inspiration, check out our pregnant bellies photo gallery.Start a daily ritual to connect with your babySet aside two five- to ten-minute periods a day to think about your baby. Just after waking up and before going to sleep works well for many expectant moms. During these times, sit quietly and gently rest your hands on your belly. Focus on your breathing and then start thinking about your baby (your hopes and dreams, your intentions as a parent, and so on). It's a great way to initiate the bonding process and to help you plan for the kind of parent you want to be.Buy some new bras and undiesIf your breasts are sore, get a good supportive cotton bra. Maternity bras can offer extra support, so try a couple on to see whether you like them. Your breasts might go up one or two more sizes, especially if this is your first pregnancy, and a knowledgeable sales associate can help you with sizing. And as your abdomen expands, maternity briefs, bikinis, and even thongs can make a bigger difference in your comfort than you may realize.Find out more about breast changes during pregnancy.Have sex if you feel up to itIn your first trimester, you may feel too tired, moody, or nauseated to make love. But if you're feeling amorous (and you don't have any complications that may make sex dangerous), go ahead  you won't hurt the baby. The amniotic sac and the strong muscles of the uterus protect your baby, and the thick mucus plug that seals the cervix helps guard against infection.Find out more about having sex during pregnancy.Talk to your partner about parentingTo get the conversation going, try this creative writing exercise: Each of you makes two lists, one titled ""My mother always..."" and one titled ""My mother never..."" Then do the same for ""My father always"" and ""My father never..."" When you're done, talk about what you wrote down and decide together which behaviors you value and which you'd like to change as you raise your child.Make a baby budgetThink about how you'll handle new-baby expenses  the cost of clothes, food, diapers, toys, and gear can add up fast. Brainstorm where you can trim your budget to make room for your baby's needs. Consider making some budget adjustments now, and start banking your savings for your baby. For more information, check our Baby Costs Calculator.Get ready to see or hear your babyAt a prenatal visit around 9 to 12 weeks, you may get to hear your baby's rapid heartbeat with the help of a Doppler fetal monitor. Many women say it sounds like the thunder of galloping horses.Some women have an ultrasound as early as 4 or 5 weeks (though the standard is between 16 and 20 weeks). If you do get to see your baby in the first trimester, don't be surprised if he or she looks like a lima bean with a tiny, flickering heart.Start a baby name listYou have plenty of time to decide on a baby name  but it's fun to start writing down the possibilities. For ideas, visit our Baby Names Finder and baby name inspiration lists.To-do's for every trimesterDrink waterDuring pregnancy you need about 10 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day (80 fluid ounces) plus an additional 8 ounces for each hour of light activity. Every woman is different, so don't worry if you end up needing a little more or less. Keep an eye on the color of your urine  if it's dark yellow or cloudy, you need to drink more.

Eating fish when you're breastfeeding: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-fish-when-youre-breastfeeding-how-to-avoid-mercury-an_10319858.bc,"Should I eat fish if I'm breastfeeding?Many nursing moms struggle with this question. The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a baby's health.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system.Because omega-3s are passed to a baby in breast milk, most experts agree that it's a good idea for nursing women to eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that women who are pregnant or nursing eat 8 to 12 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. But it's hard to figure out which fish are best.Below, we offer some guidelines to help you limit your baby's exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury while I'm breastfeeding?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish. While the metal doesn't typically enter breast milk in large amounts, the mercury that does make its way into your milk is absorbed by your nursing baby's body at a time when she's especially susceptible to its effects.Many studies have shown that exposure to even low doses of methylmercury can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies (including those in utero) and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice. Studies have shown that getting enough omega-3s in utero and during infancy (either through breastfeeding or supplemented formula) has a positive effect on a child's vision and cognitive development.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad. For example, 8 ounces of salmon, 12 ounces of rainbow trout, or 16 sardines a week should give you a good dose of omega-3s with minimal mercury.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs. Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA says it's okay to eat canned light tuna but suggests limiting your intake of albacore (white) tuna, which is higher in methylmercury, to 6 ounces per week.Purdue University guidelines say it's okay to eat up to 12 ounces a week of canned light tuna but recommend limiting your consumption of canned white tuna to 4 ounces per week.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend avoiding canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.Consumer Reports magazine also recommends avoiding all forms of canned tuna. They've found that white tuna has consistently high levels of methylmercury and some light tuna has high levels as well, so it's not worth the risk.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your intake of it to 6 ounces per week and not eating any other fish that week.What can I eat, other than fish, to get my omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?If you don't eat fish, you might choose to take an omega-3 supplement. A few studies have shown small benefits in child cognitive development when pregnant or nursing women take omega-3 supplements, but most have shown no significant benefits from these supplements.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.Note: Some women turn to cod liver oil as a source of omega-3s. This is risky. Cod liver oil is very high in vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses. Another concern is that it's impossible to verify whether the oil has been filtered to eliminate toxins such as PCBs.How much omega-3s should I get each day?The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women get 250 milligrams of EPA and/or DHA a day by eating 8 ounces of fish that are rich in omega-3s each week.The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.How can I find out how much mercury is in my body?It's simple to test for mercury in your blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your mercury levels in a safe range.If you eat fish more often than recommended and are concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your levels indicate that you're getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change your diet accordingly.Learn more:Should your kids eat fish: How they can avoid mercury and still get their omega-3s.This article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's early development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a developing baby and a healthy pregnancy.Your body will store omega-3s for several weeks, so it's a good idea to make sure you're getting enough now so you'll have adequate levels when you become pregnant.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system. Mercury accumulates in the body  and takes time to go away once you reduce your intake  so you're right to be concerned about your exposure before becoming pregnant.Most experts agree that women in their childbearing years should eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume about 8 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. (For pregnant or nursing women, they recommend 8 to 12 ounces a week.) But it can be hard to figure out which ones are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby will need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural.

Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish and stores it for months. Once you become pregnant, the mercury in your body will cross the placenta, too.Many studies have shown that exposure even to low doses of methylmercury during pregnancy can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies in utero, infants, and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice.For example, in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores.Some studies also show that eating fish during pregnancy may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight. So you'll want to keep eating fish once you become pregnant, too.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad. For example, 8 ounces of salmon, 12 ounces of rainbow trout, or 16 sardines a week should give you a good dose of omega-3s with minimal mercury.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list.

It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury while I'm pregnant?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish  and when you're pregnant, methylmercury crosses the placenta.Many studies have shown that exposure even to lose doses of methylmercury during pregnancy can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies in utero, infants, and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice  especially during pregnancy.For example, in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores.Some studies also show that eating fish during pregnancy may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs. What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA says it's okay to eat canned light tuna but suggests limiting your intake of albacore (white) tuna, which is higher in methylmercury, to 6 ounces per week.Purdue University guidelines say it's okay to eat up to 12 ounces a week of canned light tuna but recommend limiting your consumption of canned white tuna to 4 ounces per week.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend avoiding canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.Consumer Reports magazine also recommends that pregnant women avoid all forms of canned tuna. They've found that white tuna has consistently high levels of methylmercury and some light tuna has high levels as well, so it's not worth the risk.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your intake of it to 6 ounces per week and not eating any other fish that week.What can I eat, other than fish, to get my omega-3s?Fish is a wonderful source of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA  crucial for baby brain and eye development. It's not easy to find these in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?If you don't eat fish, you might choose to take an omega-3 supplement. A few studies have shown small benefits in child cognitive development when pregnant or nursing women take omega-3 supplements, but most have shown no significant benefits from these supplements.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.Note: Some women turn to cod liver oil as a source of omega-3s. This is risky. Cod liver oil is very high in vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses. Another concern is that it's impossible to verify whether the oil has been filtered to eliminate toxins such as PCBs.How much omega-3s should I get each day?The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women get 250 milligrams of EPA and/or DHA a day by eating 8 ounces of fish that are rich in omega-3s each week.The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.How can I find out how much mercury is in my body?It's simple to test for mercury in your blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your mercury levels in a safe range.If you eat fish more often than recommended and are concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your levels indicate that you're getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change your diet accordingly.Learn moreIs it safe to take omega-3 supplements when you're pregnant?Eating fish when you're breastfeedingThis article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

What every toddler needs to thrive,https://www.babycenter.com/0_what-every-toddler-needs-to-thrive_1168433.bc,"You don't have to be a child development expert to give your toddler a good start in life. Recent research confirms what we've known all along: Love, attention, and basic care are all your child really needs and wants. To help your toddler reach his full potential, follow these eight simple steps:Show your loveIt seems obvious, but it's true: Children need love to live. Your emotional caring and support give your child a secure base from which to explore the world.This isn't just touchy-feely advice. Scientific evidence shows that love, attention, and affection in the first years of life have a direct and measurable impact on a child's physical, mental, and emotional growth. Love and touch actually cause your child's brain to grow, according to Marian Diamond, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of Magic Trees of the Mind: How to Nurture Your Child's Intelligence, Creativity, and Healthy Emotions From Birth Through Adolescence.How do you show your love? Hug, touch, smile, encourage, listen to, and play with your child whenever you can. Responding to your child's needs for comfort and attention is important too. Experts say it's impossible to spoil a child with love.Being there for your child when he's upset builds trust and a strong emotional bond, according to Zero to Three, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of infants, toddlers, and families. And responding to your child's bids for attention during happy times is just as important.Care for your child's basic needsFor your child to be able to devote her energy to learning and growing, she has to be well fed. Diets that are low in protein and vitamins and minerals, and either too low or too high in calories can slow development.If you're breastfeeding, talk to your child's doctor about supplementing her diet with 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D every day. This ensures that the calcium she eats gets absorbed into her bones.She also needs to be healthy, well rested, and comfortable. For example, wet diapers and ear infections are big energy drains, and frequent ear infections may delay speech development). To keep your child healthy, take her for regular checkups, keep her immunizations up-to-date, and help her get plenty of sleep.During REM (rapid eye movement) sleep your child's brain cells are making important connections called synapses. These pathways enable all learning, movement, and thought. They are the key to your child understanding all she is seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling as she explores the world.If you're worried about your toddler's sleeping or eating patterns, talk to your doctor. Talk to your childResearch shows that children whose parents spoke to them extensively as young children develop more advanced language skills and richer vocabularies than kids who didn't receive much verbal stimulation.If your child's too young to carry on a conversation, just describe what you're doing: ""Mommy is putting warm water in the tub so you can get cleaned up."" Steer clear of baby talk. Although it can help young babies learn language, speaking correctly teaches your growing child good language skills.Read to your childNext to talking, reading out loud is one of the most important things you can do to help your child build her vocabulary, stimulate her imagination, and improve her language skills. It also gives you an opportunity to cuddle and socialize.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends reading aloud daily to your child. Schedule daily reading time to make it a part of your baby's routine.And look for other ways to expose your child to the joys of reading. Most libraries have regular story times for young children.Wondering where to start? Take our reading quiz to see how much you know.Stimulate all his sensesFor your child to learn about people, places, and things, he needs to be exposed to them. Every new interaction gives him information about the world and his place in it. Studies show that children who grow up in an enriched environment  one with lots of new experiences that engage their senses  have larger, more active brains than those who grow up without adequate sensory stimulation.You don't need to bombard your child with stimulation 24 hours a day, nor should you try to engage all his senses at once. Children can become overstimulated. Just let your child play with lots of different toys and objects.Choose playthings in a variety of shapes, textures, colors, sounds, and weights. Play music and interactive games (such as peekaboo and patty-cake), go on walks and shopping trips together, and let your child meet new people. Even the simplest daily activities stimulate a toddler's brain development.Learn more about the effect of music on your child's development, and get the lyrics to your favorite lullabies.Also, give your child room to roam. Toddlers need space to crawl, walk, and run to develop strong muscles, good balance, and coordination. They also benefit from safe spaces where they can explore their surroundings without hearing someone say, ""No!"" or ""Don't touch!""The easiest way to do this is to childproof your home (or at least the common areas). Keep dangerous objects out of your child's reach and safe ones accessible.For instance, in the kitchen, put childproof locks on all the cabinets but one. Fill that with plastic bowls, measuring cups, wooden spoons, and pots and pans that your toddler can play with safely. (Be sure that your child plays well away from the stove area, where hot liquids can spill and cause scald burns.) Encourage new challengesIt's important not to frustrate your child with toys and activities that are way beyond her abilities, but a little struggling goes a long way toward becoming independent. When an activity doesn't come easily to your toddler, she has to figure out a new way to accomplish the task. That type of problem-solving builds better brains.If she's attempting to open a box, for example, resist the urge to help. Let her try first. If she continues to struggle, show her how it's done, but then give her back a closed box so she can make another attempt on her own.Take care of yourselfParents who are feeling down or upset may find it difficult to respond promptly and sensitively to their child's needs. If you're feeling blue, find ways to divide the household and parenting responsibilities with your partner. If you're a single parent, surround yourself with people who can offer you help and support.And don't forget to take some time for yourself. Being a parent  especially an involved and active one  is tiring, and you need time to re-energize.If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed with sadness or anxiety, being unable to care for yourself or your child, or losing interest in things that normally make you happy, you may have depression. Don't be afraid to ask for help: Talk to your caregiver if you think you may be depressed.Get more advice on coping with depression.Find good childcareIf you work or need a babysitter regularly, finding a quality childcare provider is essential to your toddler's healthy development. You need someone who can do all the things mentioned above when you're not around.Whether you choose a nanny, relative, or daycare center, look for a provider who is experienced, caring, and reputable. A genuine love for children and the energy to help them thrive should also be on your wish list."
Future fathers: 9 ways to help her get pregnant,https://www.babycenter.com/0_future-fathers-9-ways-to-help-her-get-pregnant_1347929.bc,"You may not find men poring over pre-pregnancy books, stocking up on the right vitamins and minerals, and avoiding hidden dangers that could harm their baby-to-be. But this kind of male nesting behavior should be more commonplace, says F. Sessions Cole, a neonatal specialist and director of the newborn medicine division at St. Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri.When a couple is trying to get pregnant, ""most of the attention is focused on the woman,"" Cole says, ""but men make up half of the equation."" If you're thinking about becoming a dad, here's a list of what you can do to ensure a healthy pregnancy before trying to conceive.Check in with your doctorMake an appointment to see your doctor, especially if you have a chronic disease, take any medication, or experience problems with erections, ejaculation, or loss of libido.It's a good idea to have a complete physical exam so your doctor can check for conditions that may affect fertility. Some conditions to watch out for include:Varicoceles, which are enlarged veins on the scrotum (the skin covering the testicles). Varicoceles prevent the testicles from cooling normally, and doctors think that may lead to fewer, misshapen, or less mobile sperm. Although varicoceles are usually harmless, and no one knows exactly how they're related to infertility, 40 percent of men with fertility problems also have varicoceles. The condition is treatable, so talk to your doctor about the options.Sexually transmitted infections (STI), which may cause male infertility. Your doctor can test you and give you the right treatment if necessary.Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) or mumps (which may result in swollen testicles) may lead to infertility. Your primary care doctor can refer you to a urologist or a male fertility specialist if you need additional testing or treatments.Let your doctor know about everything you're taking, whether it's prescribed or over-the-counter. Certain medications can affect either the quality or quantity of sperm and cause male fertility problems. Such drugs include:Any steroid or hormone, particularly testosteroneSome high blood pressure drugsA few antibioticsSome medications used to treat diseases like fungal infections, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, peptic ulcers, and seizuresIn most cases, the effect is reversible once you go off the drugs. Talk to your doctor about your plans to become a dad, and find out if you can safely switch to a different medication.Anabolic steroids, which bodybuilders use to bulk up, are well studied, and evidence shows they can reduce sperm count and shrink the testicles. Though herbs and supplements may seem harmless, your doctor is the best person to decide whether they could interfere with your ability to father a child.Finally, ask your doctor about any hazards you may be exposed to on the job or elsewhere. Exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and organic solvents, for example, can affect the quality and quantity of your sperm. Get in touch with your medical rootsThe most important thing to find out is whether anyone in your family has a genetic or chromosomal disorder, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, or a bleeding disorder.It's also important to note that some conditions are related to ethnic background. For example, Tay-Sachs is common among Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians, and sickle cell anemia occurs more frequently in African Americans than other ethnic groups.You'll also want to find out if any relatives have intellectual disability or other developmental delays, or if they were born with an anatomical birth defect, like a cardiac or neural tube defect. Your partner will need to provide this information at her first preconception or prenatal visit, and your answers can help determine whether any specific prenatal tests are recommended.You and your partner might want to consider genetic counseling. This type of counseling helps you find out what risks you face and which screening tests to consider before pregnancy.Stock your fridge with healthy foodsIf you thought you could continue mowing down chili dogs and cheese fries while your partner dines on grilled chicken and steamed vegetables, think again. Not only will it be easier for her if you follow the same healthy eating lifestyle, your sperm will be better off, too.Some studies suggest that certain antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, can boost sperm count and motility. But before you reach for the supplements, check with your doctor. Too much C and E may damage your sperm's DNA.The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says that a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, along with a multivitamin, may improve sperm quality. Lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy can also help to enhance sperm health.Eating a healthy diet can help you maintain a healthy weight, too. Being overweight has been linked to lower testosterone, poor sperm quality, and reduced fertility. One study found that the odds of infertility increased by 10 percent for every 20 pounds of excess weight.If you have questions about your diet, check with your doctor or a nutritionist.Just say no to partyingThe party's over for your partner once you start trying for a baby, but what about you? Same goes for men, says Cole. Sperm is just as affected by tobacco, alcohol, and drugs as a woman's eggs.Research suggests that this troublesome trio may lower sperm counts and slow motility. That means you should completely cut out recreational drugs (such as marijuana and cocaine), cut down on alcohol, and quit smoking before you start trying to conceive.Plus, kicking the habit now can help your family later. Secondhand smoke is not only dangerous for your partner it's also dangerous for your child  both in utero and after birth. Even using chewing tobacco has been linked to poor sperm function.Check your workplace and home for hazardsOther hidden dangers to sperm may be lurking where you work. Regular exposure to pesticides and other chemicals such as organic solvents, which are often found in dry cleaning and auto shops, can make it more difficult to conceive. They also can alter sperm composition, leading to birth defects and premature delivery.Because it takes three months for sperm to develop and fully mature, limit your exposure to these chemicals at least three months before you and your partner start trying to conceive. Ask your employer for a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that details any chemical exposure you have at work. And visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website for more information on how to avoid workplace hazards that can harm your reproductive health.Certain hobbies may expose you to harsh chemicals as well. Refinishing furniture, repairing cars, painting, building models, or any other activity that uses strippers, degreasers, or non-water-based glues and paints can expose you to solvents.Similarly, making pottery or stained glass windows and handling, shooting, and cleaning guns may expose you to lead or other heavy metals. That doesn't mean you have to drop all your hobbies and take up knitting, just check with your doctor to see what your risk level is. Buy some boxersThe jury is still out on the boxers versus briefs debate. Some say the testes can get overheated in briefs, inhibiting sperm production. Others say it's really not an issue unless sperm count is already a concern.Cole points out that if wearing boxers can potentially give you an edge over briefs, why not go with boxers for a few months? It's a fairly simple wardrobe adjustment that could speed things along.Stay out of the hot tubDon't use hot tubs, saunas, or hot baths to unwind for up to three months before trying to conceive. Heat kills sperm. And because it can take that long for sperm to regenerate, spending a long time in the hot tub in January means it could be April before you have a full set of swimmers again.Testicles function best when they keep their cool: The ""boys"" are happiest at 94 to 96 degrees, a couple of degrees cooler than normal body temperature.Be bike-savvyCasual cyclists don't need to stress about the studies that found long hours on a hard bike seat can lead to lower semen volume and reduced sperm count and motility. It's the hardcore athlete who spends more than two hours a day, six days a week in the saddle who should take note: All that riding can injure the scrotum and testes, potentially leading to fertility problems.What's more, wearing bike shorts for hours on end can kill sperm as effectively as soaking in a hot tub. The scrotal area gets hot and sweaty on a bike seat, and that can lead to lower sperm counts in avid cyclists. Men's testes are outside the body for a reason  they need a cooler environment to function properly.If you're going to ride, limit your time in the saddle, wear loose-fitting shorts, and choose the softest seat available.RelaxAlthough the possibility of getting your partner pregnant is wildly exciting, it can also be stressful, especially if conception takes several months. Take time to relax and unwind  go for a swim, shoot some hoops, or take a stroll. Studies haven't concluded that these activities will boost your conception odds, but they will certainly make the process more pleasant, says psychologist Alice Domar, assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School.Show sources Hide sources APA. 2011a.

Doctor visit: The 12-month checkup,https://www.babycenter.com/0_doctor-visit-the-12-month-checkup_6639.bc,"To help you prepare for your 12-monthwell-baby checkup, you may want to read through the questions the doctor is likely to ask and jot down answers beforehand.What the doctor will doWeigh and measure your babyYou'll need to undress your baby completely for weighing. The doctor weighs your baby, measures length and head circumference, and plots the numbers on agrowth chart. The chart enables you and your doctor to track your baby's rate of growth.Do a complete physicalHeart and lungs: Uses a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems.Eyes: Checks for signs of congenital eye conditions and other problems. May also check for blocked tear ducts and discharge.Ears: Looks for signs ofinfectionand observes how your baby responds to sound.Mouth: Looks for signs of infection and any new teeth, among other things.Head: Checks the soft spots (fontanels) and the shape of your baby's head.Body: Checks your baby's reflexes and muscle tone, and examines his skin for rashes and paleness. Pale skin is a sign ofiron-deficiency anemiawhich babies are at high risk for between 9 and 24 months.Belly: Presses gently on the abdomen to check for a hernia or enlarged organs.Genitals: Opens your baby's diaper and checks for signs of infection.Hips and legs: Moves your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Give your baby her shotsYour baby will receive theHib,pneumococcal,chicken pox (varicella), MMR, andhepatitis Avaccines (combined into two or three shots). Also: hepatitis B, andpolio(if she hasn't had the third doses yet).An assistant may administer the vaccines. This is usually done at the end of the appointment so you can have some privacy afterward to comfort your baby.Address any other concernsThe doctor will order a blood test foriron-deficiency anemiaand assess your child's risk oflead exposureand order a blood test to screen for it, if necessary.The doctor will address any other concerns (such as questions about vitaminsand treatingfalls,cuts and scrapes), ask you some questions (see below), and help you understand what's normal at this age.You can expect your baby's doctor to:Weigh and measure your child to make sure he'sgrowingat a healthy, steady rate.Check your child's heart and breathing.Check your child'seyesand ears.Measure your baby's head size to keep track of her brain growth.Answer any questions you have aboutvitamins, if you want your child to take them.Address any of your concerns about your 12-month-old's health, including how to treatcolds,coughs,cuts, and bumps and falls.Offer information on how (and how not) to discipline your child.Make sure your child is continuing to learn new skills and not losing old ones.Offer insight into your child'sdevelopment, temperament, and behavior.Assess your child's risk oflead exposureand order a blood test to screen for it, if necessary.Order a blood test to screen for iron-deficiency anemia.Questions the doctor may ask:How does your child sleep?Your 12-month-old may be waking up often at night. He may miss the fun and companionship of daytime and be reluctant to go back to sleep. The doctor may have helpful suggestions, especially if you can provide details on how much your child sleeps and when. Most 12-month-oldssleepa little more than 11 hours at night and just under three hours during the day.How is your child eating?Twelve-month-olds can feed themselves with their hands and drink from a sippy cup. Most kids have tripled their birth weight by their first birthday. Don't worry if yours is a little ahead of or behind that marker.How many teeth does your child have?Many 12-month-olds have as many as eightteeth. Others still have none. Your child may suffer from red, swollen, and tender gums when her teeth are erupting, and your doctor can suggest ways to soothe them. As soon as teeth emerge,start brushing themonce a day.Is your child pulling up? Standing? Walking?By now your child is probably an experiencedcruiserand can stand on his own. He may even have takenhis first steps. If not, don't worry  many children don't walk until they're 14 or 15 months old. But if your child can't bear his own weight on his legs, tell the doctor. In addition to pulling up and standing, your child should also becrawlingor getting around some other way. If he's not, let the doctor know.Does your child point at objects?Between 9 and 12 months, most children start pointing at things that catch their attention, such as dogs and toys. It's a nonverbal way of trying to communicate with you and an important step inlanguage development.What does your child say?At this age most kids can join syllables together andjabber wordlike sounds, say ""mama"" and ""dada,"" and maybe say a couple of other words as well. Let the doctor know what your child understands. Your child should know and respond to her own name and other familiar words and show an interest in others' conversations. If she's not making any sounds or is making fewer than she was before, tell the doctor.How are your child's social skills?Most 1-year-olds enjoy playing games with others, including peekaboo and patty-cake. Your child will imitate everyday actions such as sweeping the floor or brushing his hair and will be exuberant and curious most of the time. He'll probably seek out interaction with familiar people but will beanxious when separated from youor around strangers.How are your child's fine motor skills?Twelve-month-olds like to point at things and can use both hands together when playing with objects. If your child isn't using both hands equally, tell the doctor.Have you noticed anything unusual about your child's eyes or the way she looks at things?At every well-baby visit, the doctor should check the structure and alignment of the eyesand your child's ability to move them correctly.How's your child's hearing?If your 12-month-old doesn't turn toward sounds, be sure to tell his doctor.

Are you ready for another one?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_are-you-ready-for-another-one_7055.bc,"No one can answer that question but you, and there's a lot to consider. This decision involves a lot of thought, such as planning when to stop using birth control, determining how much time to take off work, and figuring out if you can still afford childcare.Some say deciding to have a second child is even harder than deciding whether to have a first because you're not just talking about having a baby  you're talking about changing a family dynamic.With each new child, you have to think about how that baby will affect your lifestyle, finances, work, relationships, and, of course, your other kids. And if you listen to what other parents say, expanding your family by one could more than double your workload.Of course, just about everyone  from doctors and scientists to your friends and neighbors  has an opinion on baby timing and the ideal family size. Weigh the pros and cons and then make your own decision.Here are some things to consider before you welcome a new baby into your life. How many kids should we have?How many kids should you have? See what other parents think.When is the best time to have another child?Some couples prefer to wait at least several years. That way, your other kids get plenty of individual attention from you and are old enough to comprehend how another child will change things. Others see a benefit to having children close together so they can be playmates  and so you won't be raising small children for years and years.Here's what some BabyCenter moms have to say:""My two boys are three and a half years apart, and I think that spacing is great,"" says Susan, an executive at a publishing company. ""Since my older son was out of diapers by the time the younger one was born, I could fall in love with the idea of having a baby again. And they're clearly in different social and developmental arenas, so I don't see a lot of sibling rivalry. They really enjoy each other.""""My three oldest children are about a year and a half apart, and though it was tough when they were all babies, in many ways it was great,"" says Barbara, a geriatric therapist. ""They really amused each other and have stayed very close. I'm one of four children myself, and I really wanted to recreate that big family feeling.""""My first two are three and a half years apart. That gave me time with the firstborn alone,"" says Janet, an advertising copywriter who is pregnant with her third child. ""I think the older the child the better because they're that much more independent and can mentally and emotionally handle the baby.""In some ways, I wish there was a bigger age gap between my second child and the new baby  they're only two years apart. I'm dreading having two in diapers at the same time. And I'm worried about the physical challenge of having two who need so much time."" What does the research say?In terms of the children's relationships with their parents, sibling rivalry, and their own self-esteem, Jeannie Kidwell, a former professor of family studies at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, says the best time to have another baby is either when your first is younger than 1 or older than 4. Babies who aren't yet 1 don't have a sense of their exclusive status, so they're less apt to resent a newcomer, she says. And children older than 4 have had time to enjoy attention from Mommy and Daddy  plus, they're now involved in activities of their own.When it comes to the health of your baby, waiting two or three years before you get pregnant again may tip the odds somewhat in your baby's favor.Studies suggest that getting pregnant within 18 months after your first child is born can make it more likely that your second child will be born early, underweight, or smaller than usual for the number of months he was in the womb.Research also suggests that if you get pregnant within 12 months of giving birth, you may be at higher risk of placental abruption and, if you previously had a c-section, placenta previa.If all this sounds confusing, let's put it in perspective. Researchers don't know for sure why waiting a short time between pregnancies raises certain risks, but they have some ideas.One is that the mother's body needs time to replenish vitamins and nutrients before giving birth again. So whether you're pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or want to wait, see your doctor early to get the right care and advice, eat a balanced diet, take prenatal vitamins with folic acid, and keep your body as healthy as you can.So waiting longer is the way to go, right? Maybe.It turns out that waiting more than five years to have your second child is also less than ideal. Some studies show that low birth weight, preterm birth, and smaller size are more likely in babies whose moms let five years or more pass before they get pregnant, and the mothers are at higher risk of developing preeclampsiaWhat else should I consider when making the decision?Science doesn't dictate all the choices we make, of course, so here are some other issues to take into account:Your lifestyleAre you settled into a nice routine with your other children? Do you have a goodchildcare system set up? Is everyone else finallysleeping through the night? Perhaps you've gotten to the point where you and your partnerhave time for each otheragain. Maybe you've gone back to work and you love it.These are all important factors when you're thinking of having another. Remember, a newborn will take over your life. Consider whether you have the time and energy an infant requires, and whether your children are ready to deal with the reality of a baby in the house.Your financial situationMoney isn't everything, but it certainly helps when you're raising a family. According to the latest government estimates, it can cost more than $10,000 a year to feed, clothe, house, and keep a child healthy. (And that's a conservative number for many parts of the country.) It's a good idea to have room in your monthly budget before you conceive another child.Consider your work situation too. Many women find it harder to keep up with full- or part-time work once the second or third child comes along. Can you afford to quit work if that seems best or to pay for the new baby's childcare if you keep your job?""My daughter is almost 4, and we haven't had another yet because we're worried about affording everything,"" says Stephanie, a college lecturer. ""We didn't have much money when we had our first, so we know what it's like not to have the resources to pay for things. That's why we want to be better prepared for the next one. Money is a huge consideration because of childcare costs.""""The other big thing is career. I stayed with my daughter her whole first year. I would like to do that with the second child too. We want another  we're just not sure when. It already feels a little late to me."" Your ageUnfortunately, parental age matters, especially for women. If you're 38 and you want two more children, you probably don't have the luxury of spacing them three years apart. But if you're younger than 30 and don't have any health problems that could makeconception difficult, you can be a little more flexible. (Learn more about yourchances of getting pregnantat different ages.)Talk about the age question with your partner: Many people have a vision of how old they want to be when they're finished having children.Your outlookDo you and your partner agree? Sometimes one partner is ready and the other isn't. It's hard to be in sync all the time. This can be a tricky one to settle, but the first step is to start talking about your differences.Sit down together and discuss your points of view. You may not resolve anything right away, but you'll have a better understanding of the issues. It might help to talk to others in this situation.Your heartSure, you can sit down with a big legal pad and run through the pluses and minuses. But this is one of those decisions that's led by the heart, so go ahead and listen to yours. If you want another baby, and your partner does too, there may be no time like the present.Join the conversationVisit these groups in the BabyCenter Community to share stories and get advice:Large FamiliesParents of Only ChildrenShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Twelve steps to a healthy pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_twelve-steps-to-a-healthy-pregnancy_9174.bc,"Now that you know you're pregnant, it's more important than ever to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. You can boost your chances of having a problem-free pregnancy and a healthy baby by following a few simple guidelines.Get early prenatal careGood prenatal care is essential for you and your baby. Call your healthcare provider right away and schedule your first prenatal visit. During that visit you'll be screened for certain conditions that could lead to complications.If you haven't yet chosen a provider, get started now. Finding the right person  whether you're looking for a doctor or a midwife  can take a while. In the meantime, let your current caregiver know if you're taking medication or have any medical concerns.Watch what you eatNow that you're eating for two, you may be surprised to learn that you only need about 300 additional calories per day. Make sure you get plenty of protein. You now need 70 grams a day compared to 45 grams before you got pregnant. And while your calcium requirement remains the same, its more important than ever that you meet it, which is a challenge for many women.You'll want to steer clear of undercooked eggs and meat, unpasteurized dairy products and juices, raw seafood, and cold deli meats to avoid ingesting bacteria that could harm your baby. Also avoid certain fish that may contain high levels of mercury or other contaminants.Weight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosTake prenatal vitaminsMost prenatal supplements contain more folic acid and iron than you'll find in a standard multivitamin.It's important to get enough folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy. Folic acid greatly reduces your baby's risk of developing neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida.Ideally, you should start taking 400 micrograms of folic acid at least one month before becoming pregnant. Once your pregnancy is confirmed, up your daily dose to 600 mcg.You also need to make sure you're getting enough iron. Your iron requirement increases significantly during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters.But more is not necessarily better  taking too much of certain things can actually be harmful. Avoid megadoses of any vitamin, and don't take any additional supplements or herbal preparations without your caregiver's okay.How to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:11Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:11Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos Exercise regularlyA good exercise program can give you the strength and endurance you'll need to carry the weight you gain during pregnancy, help prevent or ease aches and pains, improve sluggish circulation in your legs, and help you handle the physical stress of labor. It will also make getting back into shape after your baby's born much easier.What's more, exercise is a great way to reduce stress, and some research suggests that staying active can boost your level of serotonin, a brain chemical linked to mood.Just remember not to push yourself too hard or let yourself get overheated or dehydrated. (You'll also need to avoid hot tubs and saunas while you're pregnant.)Get some restThe fatigue you feel in the first and third trimesters is your body's way of telling you to slow down. So listen up and take it easy as much as you can. If you can't swing a nap in the middle of the day, give yourself a break and let your other responsibilities slide a little. If you can't sleep, at least put your feet up and read a book or leaf through a magazine.Relaxation techniques such as yoga, stretching, deep breathing, and massage are all great ways to combat stress and get a better night's sleep.Just say no to alcoholDon't drink while you're pregnant: Any alcohol you drink reaches your baby rapidly through your bloodstream, crossing the placenta, and your baby can end up with higher levels of blood alcohol than you have.As little as one drink a day can increase your odds of having a low-birthweight baby and increase your child's risk for problems with learning, speech, attention span, language, and hyperactivity. And some research has shown that expectant moms who have as little as one drink a week are more likely than nondrinkers to have children who later exhibit aggressive and delinquent behavior.Women who have more than two drinks a day are at greater risk for giving birth to a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born with this condition suffer from mental and growth retardation, behavioral problems, and facial and heart defects.Drinking also increases your risk for miscarriage and stillbirth. So play it safe  avoid alcohol completely and have a nonalcoholic drink instead. Let your caregiver know if you're having trouble giving up alcohol, so you can get help. Swear off all illicit drugsAny drug you use gets into your baby's bloodstream as well. Some studies suggest that marijuana may restrict your baby's growth and cause withdrawal symptoms (like tremors) in your newborn.Using cocaine is extremely dangerous. It restricts the flow of blood to the uterus and may lead to miscarriage, growth problems, placental abruption, or premature delivery. Your baby could be stillborn or have birth defects or developmental and behavioral problems.Other drugs can be very harmful, too. If you have a drug problem, seek help now.Stop smokingSmoking increases the risk of miscarriage, growth problems, placental abruption, and premature delivery. Some research has even linked smoking to an increased risk of having a baby with a cleft lip or palate.Not convinced yet? Smoking during pregnancy increases the chance that a baby will be stillborn or die in infancy. It's never too late to quit or cut back. Every cigarette you don't light gives your baby a better chance of being healthy. If you're unable to quit on your own, ask your caregiver for a referral to a smoking cessation program. Even if you're not a smoker, stay away from secondhand smoke.Cut back on caffeineThe March of Dimes advises women to limit their caffeine consumption intake to less than 200 mg per day, an amount you could get from one 8-ounce cup of strong coffee. This recommendation came from a 2008 study showing that women who consumed that much doubled their risk of miscarriage compared to those who had no caffeine.What's more, caffeine has no nutritive value and makes it harder for your body to absorb iron, something pregnant women are already low on. It's also a stimulant, so it can make it even harder for you to get a good night's sleep, give you headaches, and contribute to heartburn.Limit your coffee drinking or consider switching to decaf. And check the caffeine content of other products you consume, like tea, soft drinks, ""energy"" drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream, as well as over-the-counter drugs, such as headache, cold, and allergy remedies. Eliminate environmental dangersSome jobs can be hazardous to you and your developing baby. If you're routinely exposed to chemicals, heavy metals (like lead or mercury), certain biologic agents, or radiation, you'll need to make some changes as soon as possible.Keep in mind that some cleaning products, pesticides, solvents, and lead in drinking water from old pipes can also be harmful. Talk to your doctor or midwife about what your daily routine involves, so you can come up with ways to avoid or eliminate hazards in your home and workplace.See your dentistDon't forget about your oral health: Brush, floss, and get regular dental care. Hormonal shifts during pregnancy can make you more susceptible to gum disease. Increased progesterone and estrogen levels can cause the gums to react differently to the bacteria in plaque, resulting in swollen, bleeding, tender gums (gingivitis). So see your dentist for a checkup and cleaning now if you haven't had a visit in the last six months.Take care of your emotional healthMany women feel like they're on an emotional roller coaster at one time or another during pregnancy. But if your mood swings are extreme or interfering with your daily life, you may be suffering from depression, a relatively common condition.If you've been feeling low for more than two weeks and nothing seems to lift your spirits  or if you're feeling particularly anxious  share your feelings with your caregiver so you can get a referral for professional help.Also let your caregiver know if you're in an abusive relationship. Pregnancy can cause stress in any relationship, and it's a common trigger of domestic violence, which puts your health and your baby at risk."

Gas and bloating during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gas-and-bloating-during-pregnancy_247.bc,"Why do I seem to have so much gas now that I'm pregnant?Everyone, pregnant or not, has gas. You may be surprised to learn that the average person passes gas 13 to 21 times a day. Once you're pregnant, you may find yourself belching or passing gas a lot more often than usual, or having to unbutton your pants to relieve bloating weeks before you begin to show.The primary reason you make more gas during pregnancy is that you have much higher levels of progesterone, a hormone that relaxes smooth muscle tissue throughout your body, including your gastrointestinal tract. This relaxation slows down digestion, which can lead to gas, bloating, burping, and flatulence, and generally create miserable sensations in your gut, especially after a big meal.In later pregnancy, your growing uterus crowds your abdominal cavity, further slowing digestion, and pushes on your stomach, making you feel even more bloated after eating.For the same reasons, you may also have heartburn or constipation during pregnancy, even if you've never been bothered by these conditions before.Pregnancy heartburn Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:00Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:00Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosWhere does gas come from?Gas gets caught in the digestive tract in two ways: when you swallow air and when bacteria in your colon (large intestine) break down undigested food. Most stomach gas results from swallowing air and is typically released by burping, though a small amount can continue down to the large intestine to be released as flatulence.Most of the gas that causes flatulence is produced when bacteria in the large intestine break down food that was incompletely digested by enzymes in the stomach and small intestine. Certain carbohydrates are the main culprits. (Protein and fats produce little gas directly, although fats can contribute to a sense of bloating and gassiness because they slow down digestion.)Some people get a lot of gas from foods that don't bother others at all. For example, people with lactose intolerance get bloated and gassy if they have dairy products like milk or ice cream. That's because they don't make enough lactase  the enzyme that breaks down the sugar in dairy products (lactose). The balance of bacteria in the colon, which varies from person to person, may also affect how much gas you make.Pregnancy gas and bloating Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:41Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:41Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Discover which foods to avoid and other tips that can help prevent gas. See all videosCan I get relief by changing my diet?The most effective way to reduce gas is usually to cut back on the foods that are most likely to cause it. But if you eliminated everything that might cause gas, it would be hard to eat a balanced diet.Start by cutting out the most likely culprits, and if that gives you relief, begin adding those foods back into your diet one by one to try to pinpoint what's causing the problem for you. Keeping a food diary can help you figure out if certain foods seem to cause you to have more gas.Beans, whole grains, and certain vegetables  such as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and asparagus  are common offenders. They contain the sugar raffinose, which makes a lot of people gassy.Some people have trouble if they eat too much fructose, a sugar present in various foods. A relatively high amount of naturally occurring fructose is present in leeks, onions, artichokes, dried fruit, canned tomatoes, ketchup, pears, apples, honey, wheat, and fruit juices.Many sodas and fruit drinks are sweetened with a form of fructose called high fructose corn syrup. (It's a good idea to avoid sodas and fruit drinks in any case because they're empty calories, and the carbonation in sodas can contribute to bloating.) Many processed foods are also made with high fructose corn syrup.Certain starches (such as wheat, corn, and potatoes, but not rice) can cause gas for some people. And certain fiber-rich foods (such as oat bran, beans, peas, and many kinds of fruit) cause gas because they're normally broken down in the large intestine.Wheat bran, on the other hand, basically passes through your digestive system without getting broken down. This makes wheat bran a good choice if you have constipation and need more fiber but also suffer from flatulence.If you're highly lactose intolerant, you probably know that dairy products can cause gas (as well as diarrhea and abdominal pain). But if you're only mildly lactose intolerant, you might not have noticed any symptoms  until a dramatic boost in your consumption of dairy products during pregnancy starts to cause problems. If you suspect dairy products are the problem, look for lactose-free milk or calcium-fortified soy milk in your supermarket. (If you aren't drinking any kind of milk, you'll probably need to take a calcium supplement. Also, ask your provider if you're getting enough vitamin D from your prenatal vitamin.)Finally, try to steer clear of high-fat and fried foods.What else can I do to get relief?In addition to adjusting your diet, you also can try to minimize the amount of air you swallow when you eat or drink. Try these suggestions:Don't eat big meals. Instead, eat several small meals throughout the day.Take your time and chew thoroughly. Don't talk while you're eating.Limit how much you drink during meals. Drink regularly throughout the day instead.Drink from a cup or glass  not from a bottle or through a straw  and don't gulp your beverages.Avoid carbonated drinks.Avoid anything sweetened with sorbitol, an artificial sweetener.Sit up while you're eating or drinking, even if you're just having a small snack.Wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't constrict your waist and tummy.Don't chew gum or suck on hard candies.Get moving. Even a brisk walk can help a sluggish digestive tract.Take steps to relieveconstipation because it can add to flatulence and a feeling of abdominal bloating.Don't smoke. Smoking not only contributes to many serious health problems, it also boosts stomach acidity. (Try to quit before getting pregnant. If you're having trouble, ask your provider to refer you to aprogram that can help.)Consider practicing prenatal yoga to learn relaxation and good breathing techniques. Some people tend to swallow more air when they're excited or anxious.If these relief measures don't help, ask your healthcare provider whether you can take anover-the-counter gas remedythat contains simethicone. (Don't take activated charcoal tablets without checking with your healthcare provider first because they may not be safe during pregnancy.)Can gas pain ever be a sign that something is wrong?Call your provider if your intestinal discomfort ever feels more like abdominal pain or cramping, or if you also have blood in your stool, severe diarrhea, constipation, or nausea and vomiting.Learn more:Avoid the 12 worst foods for pregnancyDiscover the best kinds of exercise for pregnancyKnow the basics of eating well during pregnancyShow sources Hide sources ACG.

Common childhood accidents and how to prevent them,https://www.babycenter.com/0_common-childhood-accidents-and-how-to-prevent-them_403.bc,"Despite the best childproofing and safety efforts, childhood accidents sometimes happen. Here are examples of some common childhood emergencies, including how they're most likely to happen, and tips for how to avoid them.BurnsBurns are among the most common childhood accidental injuries, and they can happen several ways:SunburnsElectrical burns and shock from inserting fingers or objects into outlets or biting electrical cordsFlames from stoves, lamps, matches, lit cigarettes, fireplaces, and house firesTouching hot surfaces, such as stoves, heaters, and microwaved containersHot liquid and steam from pans, cups, hot water heaters, and bath waterSafety tips:Set water heaters no higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit.Never leave food cooking unattended on the stove, and keep pot handles turned out of reach. Always supervise children in the kitchen.Install and maintain smoke alarms on every floor of your home and near bedrooms.Learn more about burns and how to prevent them.PoisoningEvery day in the United States, more than 300 children are treated for poisoning in emergency rooms, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Accidental poisoning can happen from:Swallowing shampoo, aftershave, perfume, cleaning products, hand sanitizer, and liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettesEating medication or vitamins, or taking an incorrect dose of medicineExposure to carbon monoxide from gas appliances such as stoves and heatersSafety tips:Get rid of expired or unnecessary medications, both prescription and over-the-counter.Keep medicines, personal care products, cleaning solutions, and household chemicals out of reach (and out of sight) of young children.Install carbon monoxide detectors.Learn the symptoms of poisoning, and get more tips to keep your child safe.DrowningDrowning remains a leading cause of death for children through age 14, and even small amounts of water pose a danger to very young kids. Take the following precautions to reduce your child's risk:Be cautious with young children around water in toilets, bathtubs, and buckets, and ice chests and coolers containing water or ice.Make sure hot tubs, spas, whirlpools, and swimming pools are inaccessible to your child.Keep your child away from fountains, irrigation ditches, postholes, and wells.Supervise your child closely whenever she's playing around water.Safety tips:Make sure buckets and pails are empty when you're not using them.Keep the toilet lid down and the bathroom door closed.Never leave your child unattended around water.Learn more about how to keep your child safe around water.FallsSome falls and tumbles are inevitable as children learn to stand, walk, run, and climb. Most aren't serious, but falls are actually the leading cause of nonfatal injuries for children, including head injuries, fractures and sprains, and contusions or bruises.Some of the most common places children fall from include:HighchairsBeds, changing tables, and other furnitureStairsSlippery floorsShopping cartsPlay equipmentUnsecured infant seatsBaby walkersWindows without proper guards or stopsSafety tips:Install window guards, stair gates, and guard rails.Take your child to age-appropriate playgrounds with soft surfaces under the equipment.Never leave a baby unattended on a changing table or other piece of furniture.Read more about what to do if your child takes a tumble.Choking, strangulation, and suffocationVery young children put pretty much everything into their mouths. And if there's a way for your child to get tangled up in cords or ribbons, she'll probably find it. Here are some examples of everyday objects that can be hazardous to your child:Small bits of food (including pet food), toys, batteries, bottle caps, coins, balloons, marbles, pen or marker caps, magnets, buttons, rubber bands, small barrettes or hair bows, and water beads are choking hazards.Necklaces, drawstrings on clothes, baby headbands, strings, ties, and ribbons as well as cords on toys, household appliances, window blinds, and other fixtures could cause strangulation.Improperly fastened safety harnesses in a highchair or stroller could allow a baby to slip down and become trapped.Older cribs with drop rails can trap a baby, and blankets, pillows, crib bumpers, and air mattresses can lead to suffocation.Safety tips:Keep cribs and beds away from windows with blinds or cords.Check between sofa and chair cushions for small toys that might have slipped down where little fingers can find them.Keep choking and strangulation hazards away from young children.Never lay your baby facedown on a soft surface.Learn emergency first aid for choking and CPR, and make sure anyone who takes care of your child has this training as well.Learn more about childproofing your nursery and choosing clothes that are safe for babies and toddlers to wear.Other common injuriesChildren can surprise you with all the ways they can get hurt. Here are other injuries to watch out for:Nose injuries from running into stationary objects, falling on a hard surface, deflecting a flying toy, or fighting with other childrenItems stuck in a nostril or ear, such as small stones, chewable vitamins, pebbles, and peasCuts and scratches from sharp fingernails, pets, sharp objects, furniture edges, sticks and other pointed objects outsideA pulled elbow from picking up your child by one arm, jerking his arm forcefully, or swinging him around by the armsEye injuries caused by dust, sand, chemical sprays, or other types of foreign matterBites from animals, insects, or another childSafety tips:Childproofing your house can go a long way toward keeping your child safe from household dangers.Knowing first aid  and knowing how to tell whether an injury is treatable at home or needs emergency medical care  can keep a bad situation from getting worse.Car safetyCollisions aren't the only thing to worry about when it comes to cars. Other dangers include:An incorrectly sized or improperly installed car seat (or not using a car seat at all)Heatstroke from leaving a child in a closed carEntrapment in power windows or car trunksGetting accidentally run overHow to install a convertible car seat: Forward-facing Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

More than 2,400 children and teens die due to gun violence each year, including about 124 killed in accidental shootings. More than 3,000 others are injured in accidental shootings each year.Safety tips:Ideally, don't have guns in the house. Keep guns unloaded in a locked location out of reach of your children, and store ammunition in a separate locked, inaccessible location.Use gun locks for added safety.Before your child plays at a friend's house, ask if there are any guns in the home.Show sources Hide sources Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

Poison-proofing your home,https://www.babycenter.com/0_poison-proofing-your-home_415.bc,"Young children explore the world by putting things in their mouth, and even curious older children don't always know what's unsafe. That explains why more than 1 million children under age 6 are victims of accidental poisoning each year.Keep your child safe by identifying (and locking up) toxic materials and knowing what to do if she swallows, inhales, or touches something poisonous.Identify poisons in each roomConduct a room-by-room inventory of toxic products, listing anything that's out in the open as well as inside drawers, cupboards, and closets. Then make sure all poisons are clearly labeled and locked out of a child's reach.Experts recommend paying particular attention to the kitchen and bathroom. It's not always obvious what's hazardous and what's not, and poisonous substances may not be in plain sight.If you're not sure whether a product is poisonous, check the label or call the American Association of Poison Control Centers' hotline at (800) 222-1222.Here are some of the hazardous substances commonly ingested by children under age 6:Cleaning products, including drain cleaner, oven cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner, bleach, dishwasher detergent, liquid laundry packets, furniture polish, and rust removerPrescription drugs such as heart and blood pressure medications, antidepressants, sleeping pills, diabetes medications, pain medications, and time-release medicationsCosmetics and personal care products, such as mouthwash, nail products, hair removerBaby oil or similar products (which can be dangerous if your child gets them in his lungs)Acetaminophen or ibuprofen, which are poisonous when taken in large dosesAspirin, which can lead to Reye's syndrome, a rare brain and liver disease that can be fatalCough and cold medicinesVitamins, especially iron supplementsButton batteriesMagnetsHousehold plants, especially philodendron and holly berriesPaint thinner, paint remover, kerosene, lighter fluid, antifreeze, and windshield washer fluidPesticides and pest control products, such as roach and ant baits, rodent poison, and insect repellentIsopropyl (rubbing) alcoholProtect your child from dangerous substancesIt's never too early to start poison-proofing your house  even before your baby is born. You'd be surprised how fast a baby can learn to get into cupboards and open child-resistant caps.Lock up all medicines and dangerous substances. Secure all cupboards that contain poisons  even those that seem out of reach  with safety latches or locks. Put away medicines and vitamins after you use them.Poison experts have heard how many young children have dragged a chair over to a kitchen counter, climbed onto the counter or refrigerator, and opened a cupboard near the ceiling. Your child may be able to do something like this before you know it.Get rid of expired medications. In general, it's not a good idea to flush expired medicine down the toilet because it can contaminate groundwater and end up in the drinking water supply. However, a few drugs are so potentially dangerous to children that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends flushing them rather than leaving them in the trash.Read the label of the medicine to find out whether it should be flushed or tossed. You can also check with your pharmacy or local waste management company to find out how to dispose of it properly. Some communities have programs for taking back expired medication.If you have to put medicine in the trash, first remove any personal information from the empty containers and then place them in a sealed trash bag with kitty litter or coffee grounds as a deterrent.Don't rely on child-resistant containers. Child-resistant doesn't mean childproof. The cap is intended to delay a child who is trying to open a container long enough for an adult to discover what's going on and intervene. Remember: No bottle top is ever so secure that a child can't find some way to get it off.""It's not unusual for a 2-year-old, left alone for 30 minutes, to break down the best devices of the manufacturer,"" says pediatrician Mark Widome.Keep medicines, pesticides, and detergents in their original containers. Never put poisonous or toxic products in unlabeled containers or containers that were once used for food. There have been too many cases of poisonings when a toxic liquid like antifreeze was mistaken for apple juice.Move purses, luggage, and grocery bags away from prying hands. A tube of brightly hued lipstick or a bottle of coated pills can look like candy to a young child. Store your purse on a high shelf, and unpack anything potentially dangerous from your grocery bag before you do anything else.Keep batteries out of reach. Don't let children play with batteries or electronic devices, such as remote controls. Button batteries can get stuck in a child's throat or intestines and release dangerous chemicals, causing severe injuries or even death.Never refer to medicine as candy. Even if you're trying to get a reluctant child to take flavored acetaminophen or antibiotic syrup, don't make your child think it's a treat.Children learn by imitation, so take medicine when your baby isn't watching. To be safe, teach your child never to eat anything without asking an adult first.Read labels before buying household products, and use the least toxic ones you can find. Among the household products generally considered less hazardous are nonchlorine bleach, vinegar, borax, and beeswax. Unclog drains with compressed air or baking soda and vinegar instead of corrosive liquids.Always keep an eye on your child. Even the most thorough childproofing is no substitute for supervision. Be extra vigilant when you have guests or visit a friend's or relative's house, especially if it hasn't been childproofed.Prevent carbon monoxide and lead poisoningInstall carbon monoxide alarms throughout your home. Carbon monoxide gas is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Every year, thousands of people are poisoned by carbon monoxide that leaks from stoves, space heaters, ovens, gas vents, furnaces, and fireplaces.Make sure all your gas appliances are in safe working order, and install a carbon monoxide alarm outside every sleeping area and on every floor of your home.Beware of lead contamination. If your house was built before 1978, has old pipes, or is located near a highway, your child is at higher risk of being exposed to lead. Consider having your home tested for lead contamination.For more information, see our article on lead poisoning or contact the National Lead Information Center at (800) 424-LEAD (5323).What to do if your child may have swallowed something dangerousIf your child is unconscious, not breathing, or having a seizure, call 911 immediately.Otherwise, call the American Association of Poison Control Centers' national emergency hotline: (800) 222-1222. Post the number now by your phone now, before an emergency occurs. (Use our handy emergency contact worksheet.) Even if your child seems okay after swallowing something potentially poisonous, call the hotline to find out if your child needs medical attention.The poison control center can help you identify the poison your child ingested and walk you through what to do. Local lines are staffed by registered pharmacists, nurses, and doctors 24 hours a day, and these professionals are trained to respond to poisoning crisis calls and answer questions about household poisons.Do not try to make your child vomit. If your child still has some of the poisonous item in his mouth, remove it or have him spit it out.Do not keep syrup of ipecac on hand in case of poisoning. It hasn't been shown to be effective in preventing poisoning and can potentially be misused.The poison control association's website also has information about poison-proofing your home."
Pantothenic acid in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pantothenic-acid-in-your-pregnancy-diet_657.bc,"Why you need pantothenic acid during pregnancyPantothenic acid, also known as vitamin B5, is essential for the production of hormones and cholesterol and for the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It's essential to all life as a component of coenzyme A (CoA), which is necessary for many chemical reactions in cells.How much pantothenic acid you needPregnant women: 6 milligrams (mg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 7 mg per dayNonpregnant women: 5 mg per dayFood sources of pantothenic acidYou'll find pantothenic acid in a wide variety of foods. Here are some good examples:3 ounces beef liver, pan-fried: 5.6 mg1 ounce sunflower seeds, dry roasted: 2.0 mg3 ounces trout, cooked: 1.9 mg8 ounces plain nonfat yogurt: 1.6 mg3 ounces lobster, cooked: 1.4 mg1/2 medium avocado: 1.0 mgone medium baked sweet potato: 1.0 mg1 cup milk: 0.87 mg3 ounces lean pork tenderloin, cooked: 0.86 mg3 ounces light chicken, cooked: 0.83 mgone large egg, hard-boiled: 0.7 mg1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled: 0.7 mg1/2 cup lentils, cooked: 0.63 mg1/2 cup split peas, cooked: 0.58 mg1/2 cup raw mushrooms: 0.52 mg1 ounce peanuts: 0.50 mg1/2 cup broccoli, chopped and cooked: 0.48 mgone medium orange: 0.30 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 0.21 mg(Note that 3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a pantothenic acid supplement?You probably don't need a supplement because pantothenic acid is present in so many foods. Pantothenic acid is also included in mostprenatal vitamin supplements.Pantothenic acid deficiencies are extremely rare, usually showing up only when someone is severely malnourished. Signs include fatigue and weakness.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 1998.

Birth story: A surprising pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_birth-story-a-surprising-pregnancy_10339771.bc,"Annastasia Lee Cavanaugh(A girl)Born June 5, 2007, at 8:18 a.m.7 pounds, 9 ounces and 20 inchesThe proud parents: Adam and Alisa CavanaughAdam and I met in high school while working at the local movie theater and began dating. We married two years after Adam graduated from college, and two years later learned I was pregnant. I work as a high school writing teacher and Adam is a TV director, and we live in southeastern Pennsylvania.How it all beganI have polycystic ovary syndrome and was told it would be difficult for us to have children. Adam and I made appointments with the appropriate doctors and decided that we would start trying in 2007. We traveled to Disney World and rode all the rides -- so I was an emotional mess after learning that I was pregnant when I had gone on Mission: SPACE, Tower of Terror, and all the roller-coasters. My doctor assured me that the baby would be fine.I had previously had a cyst removed from my breast and another from my ovaries, and the surgeons noticed something was not right with my blood. It was determined that I have a blood disorder called MTHFR; I do not absorb enough folic acid and I am prone to clotting. So every day throughout my pregnancy I took a prenatal vitamin with extra folic acid, a folic acid pill, and a baby aspirin. I also had extra ultrasounds -- about eight total -- and weekly non-stress tests beginning in week 28. Anna was a gymnast inside and started causing contractions at 27 weeks.My weight gain over the course of my pregnancy totaled 28 pounds. But at my 33-week checkup, my doctor found I had gained 7 pounds in one week and put me on bedrest. I had to take a daily trip due to my blood clot disorder, but I couldn't drive. It was awful. Luckily, Anna decided to come 12 days before my due date. ShowtimeFor two weeks before I gave birth, I had brief periods of contractions that grew intense. The night before real labor, I was awake from 1 to 5 a.m. timing contractions, but they were inconsistent and stopped by 7 a.m. That night, I crawled into bed and read a book until almost midnight, and as soon as I started to fall asleep the contractions began again.By 3 a.m. they were about four minutes apart. I woke up Adam and called the doctor, who told me to come in. We arrived about 4 a.m.; I was completely effaced and 2 centimeters dilated.I worked through each contraction by closing my eyes and focusing on the end result: my baby. Adam held my hand and reminded me to breathe. We watched the contractions on the screen and listened to the baby's heartbeat. It was quiet.By 7:45 a.m. I was 7 centimeters dilated. The doctor asked if I wanted an epidural; I said yes and the nurse started my IV. At 7:50, I felt an overwhelming desire to push. The nurse told me to wait for the doctor to return. Five minutes later, I was at 9 centimeters. The doctor said she could break my water and move things along, or we could wait for the epidural. I meekly asked, ""No meds?"" She laughed and said no. I agreed.I started to push at 8:05 a.m. and Anna arrived 13 minutes later. It happened so fast, the doctor was struggling to put her gloves on. Our families hadn't even arrived yet.Adam had said earlier he wasn't sure if he would watch the birth or cut the cord, but he ended up doing both and was glad he did. After the deliveryI fell in love the minute I saw her. The pain disappeared and I was so relieved to have her in my arms. My husband couldn't stop smiling. She was perfect. I whispered her name as she looked at me with those blue eyes. She was even more beautiful than I imagined.The doctor and nurses kept saying they were amazed she was my first because the birth happened so fast. The nurse had to remind my husband that he could take pictures. Adam and I laughed because we had packed all this stuff -- iPods, magazines, books, pillows, snacks for him, and my blanket for comfort -- and it was over in less than four hours. I was amazed I did it with out drugs; I didn't think I was capable of that. When the doctor offered me Percocet, I laughed. What did I need that for now?Next time, I will have more faith in myself. If I can have a natural, unmedicated childbirth, I can do anything. Women should have faith in themselves: Our bodies are amazing and can do anything. I have respect for all women who give birth no matter their circumstances. Pregnancy and childbirth is an amazing thing. I am looking forward to the next one."
Eight steps for safe travel during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eight-steps-for-safe-travel-during-pregnancy_1339353.bc,"Although it can be perfectly safe to travel during your pregnancy, you'll need to do some extra planning and take a few added precautions. Here's a checklist of things to do before you hit the road:1. Consult your healthcare provider firstYour doctor or midwife will tell you that traveling in the middle of your pregnancy is best because most emergencies happen in the first and last trimesters. Ask your doctor or midwife whether there are any medical concerns you should be aware of or upcoming tests you need to work around.Women with high-risk pregnancies need to be extra cautious, which may prohibit travel. And depending on where you want to go, you may need a vaccine that isn't safe during pregnancy, which may also put a damper on your travel plans.2. Consider your prenatal test scheduleTime your travel around anyprenatal testsyou want or need to schedule. The following tests are usually done during the specified weeks of pregnancy: a first trimester screen for Down syndrome (at 9 to 13 weeks),chorionic villus sampling (CVS)(at about 10 to 12 weeks), nuchal translucency (between 11 and 14 weeks),amniocentesis(at about 16 to 20 weeks),multiple marker screening(15 to 18 weeks),ultrasound(16 to 20 weeks),glucose screening test (GCT)(24 to 28 weeks), andgroup B strep screening(35 to 37 weeks). (And if you'reRh-negative, you'll need your shot of Rh immunoglobulin at 28 weeks.)If you're planning to have one or more of these tests, allow time to get the results  and strategize next steps, if necessary  before leaving on an extended trip.Prenatal test: Nuchal translucency scan (NT scan) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:49Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:49Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch to learn more about this safe procedure. See all pregnancy videos3. Gather your medical records and vital health informationBefore you leave, prepare a list of key names and phone numbers you'll need in case of emergency and pack it in your carry-on luggage.If you are in your second or third trimester, ask your doctor or midwife for a copy of your prenatal chart, and bring that along, too. Keep it with you at all times during your trip.Typically, this chart includes your age, your blood type, the name and contact information for your healthcare provider, the date of your last menstrual period, your due date, information about any prior pregnancies, your risk factors for disease, results of pregnancy-related lab tests and ultrasounds, your medical and surgical history, and a record of vital signs taken at each visit.If you're planning an extended visit, research where the nearest hospital is that has prenatal care and have your healthcare provider refer you to someone in the area for check-ups or emergencies.4. Make sure you have all the medications you needBe careful to pack a sufficient supply of prescription medications, prenatal vitamins, and even over-the-counter remedies you may need during your trip  especially if you're going someplace where those medications aren't readily available. It's a good idea to keep prescription medicine in its original container, so if your bags are searched it will be clear that you're not using medication without a prescription.Pregnancy Safety QuestionsOur experts answer your most pressing questions about what is and isn't safe during pregnancy. 5. Check your health insurance policyFind out if it covers pregnancy complications during travel to your intended destinations (particularly if they include foreign countries). If not, you may want to purchase additional insurance.6. Buy travel insuranceThis special insurance covers expenses if you miss all or part of your trip, or run up emergency expenses on the road. Make sure the policy covers pregnancy complications as well as emergency medical transport from your chosen destination(s).7. Prepare for the unexpectedIf you haven't already, join an auto club that provides road service in case your car breaks down or has a flat tire. Carry the phone numbers for any airlines you'll be using in case you need to confirm or reschedule flights. And always carry a cell phone, especially if you're traveling alone.8. If flying in your third trimester, check your airline's policiesAlthough rules vary, many airlines don't allow pregnant women to fly during the last week or month of their pregnancy without a note from their healthcare provider. Airline regulations aside, most healthcare providers discourage travel after 36 weeks unless it's absolutely necessary.Show sources Hide sources AAFP. 2011. Ultrasound during pregnancy.

Formula feeding: Helping your baby get used to the bottle,https://www.babycenter.com/0_formula-feeding-helping-your-baby-get-used-to-the-bottle_6421.bc,"Whether your child is a newborn just starting to formula-feed, a breastfed baby getting supplemental formula, or a baby transitioning from breast milk to formula, she'll need a little time to adjust. The first few feedings may be a little awkward, but don't worry  she'll soon get the hang of it. Read on for some ways you can make bottle feeding go smoothly.What's the best way to bottle-feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks when formula feeding, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or two. Offer the bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.Also, keep in mind that the way a baby sucks from a bottle is very different from the way she sucks from a breast because getting milk from a bottle is easier. (Some babies prefer the bottle for this reason.)Don't force more than she seems ready to eat. Until your baby weighs about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Your baby's doctor can advise you about suitable amounts for your baby as she grows.Bottle feeding can be just as nurturing as breastfeeding, so cuddle your baby close. Some babies like to be held in a nursing position while drinking from a bottle, but others find it disconcerting. Whatever position you choose, try to maintain eye contact with your baby. (And don't feed her while she's lying on her back because she may choke.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.What can I do if my baby resists taking a bottle?Whatever technique you decide to use, be consistent and try it a few times, especially in the beginning. Here are a few tips:Offer your baby a bottle before he gets too hungry. You want him to be interested in food, but not so hungry that a cold nipple frustrates him. (Cold rubber or latex isn't that appealing.)Let your baby play with the nipple. If he just chews on it, let him for now. He's becoming familiar with it and may actually start sucking on it soon.Hold him in a different position. Put him in an infant car seat so he is semi-upright, and then feed him the bottle while facing him. Or try feeding him on your lap with his back to your chest. Once he's used to taking a bottle, you can hold him as you usually would for feedings.Try different temperatures. It could be that your baby prefers his milk slightly warmer or colder than you've been giving him. Experiment with different temperatures to see what he prefers.(Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly and can create hot pockets, leading to burns. It can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down.)Let someone else introduce the bottle. If you're supplementing breastfeeding, it may help to let your partner or another caregiver give your baby the first bottle. Your baby knows your scent and associates it with breastfeeding.Offer the bottle at other times. For example, if your baby has been refusing the bottle during the day, offer it in the evening.Whichever technique you use, remember that your baby needs time to get used to new sensations, so stick with the same nipple, bottle, and feeding technique for a while before trying something different.I feel guilty for not breastfeeding. What should I do?Whatever your reason for not breastfeeding, give yourself a break. Formula feeding is a valid, healthy choice for babies. Formula even has some nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.Find out more about formula feeding."
17 things you should do before you try to get pregnant,https://www.babycenter.com/0_17-things-you-should-do-before-you-try-to-get-pregnant_7171.bc,"You've decided to take the plunge into parenthood. But wait just a second  or even a month or more. To give yourself the best chance for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby, there are some important things you need to do before you head down the road to conception.1. Schedule a preconception visitYou don't have to have a doctor or midwife lined up to deliver your baby yet, but call your ob-gyn, midwife, or family practice doctor now for a preconception checkup. Your practitioner will review your personal and family medical history, your present health, and any medications or supplements you're taking. Certain medications and supplements are unsafe during pregnancy, and some may need to be switched before you even try to conceive because they're stored in your body's fat and can linger there.Your practitioner will likely discuss diet, weight, exercise, and any unhealthy habits you may have (such as smoking, drinking, and taking drugs); recommend a multivitamin; make sure you're up to date on your immunizations; test you for immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox and rubella; and answer any questions you have. In addition, you may be referred to a specialist if you have certain medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, or high blood pressure, that need to be controlled before you get pregnant.If it's been at least a year since you had a checkup, you can also expect to have a pelvic exam and a Pap smear, and to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases if you're at risk.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

Consider genetic carrier screeningYour practitioner should offer you genetic carrier screening before you start trying to conceive to see whether you or your partner is a carrier for serious inherited illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and others. If both you and your partner are carriers, your child will have a 1 in 4 chance of having the disease.You can meet with a genetic counselor who will be able to tell you more about the condition and help you sort out your reproductive choices. This may be the single most important thing you can do to help ensure a healthy baby, and all it requires is a saliva or blood sample from each of you. It's even covered by most health insurance policies.Are you pregnant?Take our quiz and find out3. Take folic acid (and watch out for vitamin A)Taking a folic acid supplement is crucial. By taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a day for at least one month before you conceive and during your first trimester, you can cut your chances of having a baby with neural-tube defects such as spina bifida by 50 to 70 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Taking folic acid helps prevent some other birth defects as well.You can buy folic acid supplements at the drugstore, or you can take a prenatal or regular multivitamin. Check the label on multivitamins to make sure they contain the 400 mcg of folic acid you need.Also check to make sure that your multivitamin doesn't contain more than the recommended daily allowance of 770 mcg RAE (2,565 IU) of vitamin A, unless most of it's in a form called beta-carotene. Getting too much of a different kind of vitamin A can cause birth defects.If you're unsure about what to take, ask your healthcare provider to recommend a supplement. 4. Give up binge drinking, smoking, and drugs  and get help if you need itIf you smoke or take drugs, now's the time to stop. Many studies have shown that smoking or taking drugs can lead to miscarriage, premature birth, and low-birth-weight babies. Keep in mind that some drugs can stay in your system even after their noticeable effects have worn off.What's more, research suggests that tobacco use can affect your fertility and lower your partner's sperm count. In fact, studies have shown that even secondhand smoke may reduce your ability to get pregnant.Moderate drinking (thats one drink a day for women) is considered fine while youre trying to conceive, but youll want to avoid excessive or binge drinking at this time. And once youre pregnant, experts recommend that you stop drinking altogether since no one knows exactly what potential harmful effects even the smallest amount of alcohol has on a developing baby.Stopping unhealthy habits can be very difficult. Don't hesitate to talk with your healthcare provider. She can talk with you about tools to help you quit smoking or refer you to a program to help you stop taking drugs, for example. Your local health department may also be able to help by putting you in touch with counselors, group programs, and other assistance.5. Stock your fridge with healthy foodsYou're not eating for two yet, but you should start making nutritious food choices now so your body will be stocked up with the nutrients you need for a healthy pregnancy.Try to get at least 2 cups of fruit and 2 1/2 cups of vegetables every day, as well as plenty of whole grains and foods that are high in calcium  like milk, calcium-fortified orange juice, and yogurt. Eat a variety of protein sources, such as beans, nuts, seeds, soy products, poultry, and meats.6. Check your caffeine intakeWhile there's no consensus on exactly how much caffeine is safe during pregnancy, experts agree that pregnant women and those trying to conceive should avoid consuming large amounts. Too much caffeine has been linked to a risk of miscarriage in some (but not all) studies.The March of Dimes advises pregnant women to limit their caffeine consumption to 200 milligrams per day, about the amount in one cup of coffee, depending on the brew. That would be a good goal to aim for as you start trying to conceive.See a chart showing the amount of caffeine in various coffee brews, other drinks, and select foods, in our article on caffeine during pregnancy.7. Aim for a healthy weightYou may have an easier time conceiving if you're at a healthy weight. Having a low or high body mass index (BMI) makes it harder for some women to become pregnant.Getting to a healthier weight now can also help you get your pregnancy off on the right foot. Women with a high BMI are more likely to have pregnancy or delivery complications, while women who start with a low BMI and fail to gain enough weight are more likely to deliver underweight babies. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to achieve your weight goals. 8. Pay attention to the fish you eatIf you're a big fan of fish, start watching your intake. While fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids (which are very important for your baby's brain and eye development), protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients, it also contains mercury, which can be harmful.Most experts agree that pregnant women should eat some fish, and that the best approach is to avoid those fish that are highest in mercury and limit your consumption of all fish. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that women of childbearing age not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish, and eat no more than 6 ounces (one serving) of solid white canned tuna per week. Other experts suggest a longer list of fish to avoid. It's also a good idea to avoid eating fish you've caught in local waters unless you're certain there are no contaminants.The FDA and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that pregnant women eat up to 12 ounces (two servings) a week of fish that are not high in mercury. Good choices include herring, farm-raised rainbow trout, salmon, and sardines.9. Create and follow an exercise programStart and stick to a fitness plan now, and you'll be rewarded with a healthy body that's fit for pregnancy. A healthy exercise program includes 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise, such as walking or cycling and weight training, on most days of the week.To increase flexibility, try stretching or yoga, and you'll have a well-rounded fitness program. Once you're pregnant, it's okay  even recommended  to continue exercising. (Unless you have pregnancy complications and have been told not to, of course.)If exercising hasn't been a priority for you lately, you'll need to ease into an exercise routine. Start with something tame, like walking 10 to 20 minutes a day. Add more activity into your daily routine by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking your car a few blocks away from work.10. See your dentistWhen you're preparing for pregnancy, don't forget about your oral health. Hormonal shifts during pregnancy can make you more susceptible to gum disease. Higher progesterone and estrogen levels can cause the gums to react differently to the bacteria in plaque, resulting in swollen, red, tender gums that bleed when you floss or brush.The good news is that women who take care of their periodontal health before they get pregnant cut down on their chances of experiencing gum complications in pregnancy. See your dentist for a checkup and cleaning now if you haven't done so in the past six months. 11. Consider money mattersAccording to a 2009 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, middle-income families will spend $286,050 to raise a child from birth through age 17. Find out how much you're likely to spend with our Cost of Raising a Child Calculator.For the more immediate future, you'll want to consider the cost of pregnancy and delivery. Without insurance, a typical vaginal delivery can cost about $9,000 and a cesarean section about $15,000. Neonatal intensive care can cost $2,000 to $3,000 a day.If you have health insurance, give the company a call and find out what kind of prenatal coverage they offer. If you're lucky enough to have a choice of plans, compare coverage and providers. If you have a particular doctor or midwife in mind, find out if she's in your plan or how much it would cost to see her out of network.Find out what your deductibles are for prenatal visits and delivery, and ask what tests and procedures your insurance covers. (Preconception and prenatal care visits and many prenatal tests should be completely covered thanks to Obama's Affordable Care Act.) If you have a high deductible, try to put a little aside now so you won't be slammed with exorbitant bills when the baby arrives.If you dont have health insurance, contact your local health department to see what programs and resources are available in your area to help pregnant women and babies get the medical care and other services they need. Call 800-311-BABY (800-311-2229) for information on prenatal services in your area. (For information in Spanish, call 800-504-7081.)12. Consider your mental healthWomen who suffer from depression are twice as likely to have problems with fertility as women who don't, says Alice Domar, director of the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF. As she points out, ""If someone is clinically depressed, she can barely take care of herself, much less a baby. From an evolutionary point of view, it makes sense that it's hard to get pregnant when you're depressed.""Domar suggests that all women, but especially those with a personal or family history of depression, do a mental health check before they get pregnant. If you notice signs of depression, such as a loss of interest and pleasure in things that you used to enjoy, a change in appetite or sleep patterns, a loss of energy, or feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, ask your practitioner for a referral to a therapist or psychiatrist for a consultation.The two most effective treatments for depression are psychotherapy and medication, and many patients do best with a combination of both. A psychiatrist can help you find an antidepressant that's safe to take while you're trying to conceive and during your pregnancy. You also may want to try stress management techniques, such as yoga and meditation, which research suggests can help depressed women conceive.13. Avoid infectionsIt's important to steer clear of infections when you're trying to get pregnant, especially those that could harm your baby-to-be.You'll want to stay away from certain foods, such as unpasteurized soft cheeses and other dairy products, cold deli meats, and raw and undercooked fish and poultry. These foods can harbor dangerous bacteria that cause listeriosis, a food-borne illness that can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth. You should also avoid unpasteurized juices because they can contain bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli.Be sure to wash your hands frequently when preparing meals, and make sure your fridge is set between 35 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 and 4 degrees Celsius) and your freezer is at or below 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C) to keep cold foods from going bad.It's a good idea to wear gloves when digging in the garden or sandbox, and to get someone else to change the litter box to avoid contracting toxoplasmosis, another infection that can be dangerous for a developing baby.Finally, make sure you get a flu shot, to avoid coming down with the flu when you're pregnant. Get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine for the coming season becomes available. Getting the flu while pregnant can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia and preterm labor. 14. Reduce environmental risksYou may not be able to entirely eliminate all environmental dangers, but you can do your best to keep as many of them as possible out of your life now. Some jobs can be hazardous to you and your unborn child, for example. If you're routinely exposed to chemicals or radiation, you'll need to make some changes before you conceive.Also, keep in mind that some cleaning products, pesticides, solvents, and lead in drinking water from old pipes can be dangerous for a developing baby. Talk to your doctor or midwife about your daily routine, and see if you can come up with ways to avoid or eliminate hazards in your home and workplace.15. Think your decision throughHaving a child is a lifetime commitment. Before you try to conceive, consider whether you're ready to take on this responsibility. Some key questions:Have you thought through how you'll handle childcare responsibilities and balancing work and family?Are you prepared to parent a special-needs child if you have one?If you have a partner, are both of you equally committed to becoming parents?If you and your partner have religious differences, have you discussed how they will affect how you raise your child?16. Figure out when you ovulateSome women simply stop using birth control when they're ready to get pregnant and let fate decide when they'll conceive. Others take a more calculated approach by charting their periods and tracking symptoms to try to pinpoint their fertile days each month.Use our Ovulation Calculator to get a rough estimate of when you're most fertile. If you want to be more exact, start charting your basal body temperature (BBT) and the changes in your cervical mucus. Tracking these symptoms over several months can help you figure out when you're ovulating during each cycle.Ovulation predictor kits can also help you figure out when you're ovulating by detecting hormones in your urine, or changes in chloride in the saliva or on the skin, that signal ovulation is about to occur. These kits cost $10 to $50 per pack and are available at drugstores.17. Toss your birth controlSo you're ready to bid adieu to birth control. For some people, ditching contraception is as easy as moving the condoms or diaphragm to the back of the dresser drawer. But going off hormonal contraception can require a bit more planning.All you have to do to reverse the effects of the Pill, the patch, or the ring is to stop using them. You don't even have to wait for the end of a monthly cycle to stop. You'll most likely get your period within a few days.For many women, fertility returns as soon as they stop using these methods, but some may take a month or so to start ovulating again. You'll know ovulation is back to normal when you're getting your period regularly.Some healthcare practitioners recommend using a barrier method and waiting until you have a couple of normal periods before trying to conceive, because this can help you establish a more accurate due date. But it's completely safe to start trying right away if you want to. And if you do get pregnant before your periods become regular again, don't worry  you can have an early sonogram to date your pregnancy.If you're using Depo-Provera, it can take up to a year after your last shot for you to start ovulating again, even if your period returns to normal sooner.

When you just can't breastfeed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_when-you-just-cant-breastfeed_8485.bc,"When Bay Area parent Charlene Hedge gave birth to her son, she took it for granted that she would breastfeed him. But it was not to be. Hedge couldn't produce enough breast milk, and even though she fed her baby every hour in hopes of increasing her milk supply, her son still wasn't getting what he needed.""They always say breast milk is best,"" she says. ""That I couldn't provide for him bothered me for a bit.""Her son fussed constantly, frustrated and unhappy. And Hedge was exhausted by the hourly feedings. Three weeks later, after consulting her doctor, the nurses at the hospital, and her baby's doctor, she called it quits.""Nature just didn't work for me,"" says Hedge, whose son grew into a healthy, happy toddler. ""I could cry and get really depressed, but it wasn't going to change anything."" So she let the whole thing go.Whatever your reasons for not breastfeeding  health, intense discomfort, or unrelenting frustration  give yourself a break. ""Good parenting is more than breastfeeding,"" says Jan Barger, an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC).Did you try your best to nurse your baby? Did you turn to others  a lactation consultant, your midwife or doctor, your baby's doctor, your partner  for help? If so, chances are you've already exhausted all available resources and are doing what's best for you and your baby.What should I do now that I'm not breastfeeding?Give yourself a breakIf you've been dead set on breastfeeding since pregnancy, you're probably feeling disappointed. Just like moms who opt for natural childbirth but end up needing a cesarean, women who want to breastfeed but can't often feel a sense of failure and sometimes blame themselves.Try not to beat yourself up, but do take the time you need to feel sad, mad, or any other emotion you may be experiencing. ""Mourn your inability to breastfeed,"" says Barger. ""For some moms, this is a loss."" Avoid telling yourself that you should've tried for another day or another feeding. ""Some of us have a lot of stick-to-it-iveness,"" says Barger. ""But some just don't. And that's okay.""And even though experts say that breastfeeding is the best nutritional option for babies, it's not right  or possible  for every mother. In 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reinforced the advice to breastfeed if at all possible, but said a woman's doctors should respect her opinion about whether breastfeeding is right for her.Today's commercially prepared formulas are nutritious and even contain some vitamins and nutrients that breastfed babies need to get from supplements, so if you can't breastfeed you can still feel confident that your baby is getting what she needs.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Talk about your feelingsIf you consulted a lactation expert through all your nursing troubles, talk to her. Be honest about your feelings. She'll likely offer soothing and consoling words that you should take to heart.Your spouse or partner, good friends, and family members can also be great sounding boards for your feelings. Take a chance and open up to them.Find out about donated breast milkIf your heart's set on feeding your baby breast milk and your child meets certain criteria  like being premature or ill  you may qualify for donated breast milk from a milk bank. Talk to your child's doctor about the possibilities.Can I still bond with my baby if I don't breastfeed?Absolutely. Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to strengthen your connection with your child, but it isn't the only way. At feeding time, hold your infant close to you and make eye contact.One client of Barger's who couldn't breastfeed ended up bottle-feeding her child as if she were nursing him. She held him in a breastfeeding position and had lots of skin-to-skin contact.Remember that your relationship with your child won't be based solely on your ability to nurse her. How you respond when she cries, how often you hold and play with her, and how you are as a parent matters more than how you feed her.Where can I turn for support?BabyCenter's Formula Feeding Mamas group is a great place to find other moms who are bottle-feeding, whether by choice or necessity. Get your questions answered or just meet other moms who know what you're going through.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Benefits of breastfeeding for mom.
